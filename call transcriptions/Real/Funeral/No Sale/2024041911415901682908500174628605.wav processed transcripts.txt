[2 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Thank you, Lucy. Hello. Good, uh, morning all. Good afternoon. Now there, uh, Jane, my name is Kevin from real insurance. How are you?
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : I'm very good. Thanks. How are you?
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : I'm good. I'm good. Thank you. And please that all calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is genuine nature. I mean, I'm suitable for your situation. So I'm here to assist you further by looking into a real funeral cover for your daughter Zoe. So can I just ask for her first name, middle name and date of birth, please? Uh, I'm Jane for the call recording. Yes, yes, yes. And a date of birth please.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Her name is Zoe Elizabeth Thompson, the 20th of the 2nd, 2002.
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So at the moment your daughter Zoe is 20 and she's a female Australian resident, is that right? Thank you so much for that. Yeah.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's her address.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So I've got your address here, Unit 1/5, Richard Place, uh, Overstone TAS 7315, is that right?
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : That's her address.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Is that, is that the address that you would like me to leave for Zoe?
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, thank you. And the mobile number here, it's 0444525572. That's your phone number. Beautiful. Would you like me to also add beans always mobile or just leave? Keep it, keep it as yours.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I just keep it as mine.
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And I've also got the e-mail address hereaswellwhichisrubygloom646@gmail.com. Is that also correct? Beautiful. And once again, please, because I've recorded any advice I provide is genuine nature. I'm not suitable for your situation. Now Jane, you can choose any emails between 3:00 to $15,000 to cover. Zoe, how much cover would you thinking of? Was that nine and a half $1000?
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's take a look at that amounts there, of course. And umm, there are no medical checks to it. Acceptance is guaranteed for your daughter as long as she's an Australian resident, which you've confirmed. And she's also between 18 and 79 years of age, which you've also confirmed as well. So was everything all correct so far? Thank you. So long as you're happy to use your umm bank details so you'll be the purchaser and pay you either Jane, you can insure your daughter Zoe for the nine and a half $1000 UMM. Now, if with the benefits, if she passes away due to an accident, we would triple out the claim, OK.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yes, right.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And there's also an accidental serious injury component within the cover to further protect Zoe. So if she were to suffer an accidental serious injury before the policy anniversary following her 75th birthday, such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit amount will be also tripled.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So that's $28,500 before the triple payouts based on nine and a half $1000 policy. Yeah. So once you commence the policy for the 1st 12 months, Zoe will be covered for accidental deaths and accidental serious injury only. And then after the first 12 months, Zoe will be covered for death due to any cause. And in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means that after holding a policy for 12 months, if Zoe were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay her out her claim in full. And that could be used towards medical expenses or even to provide for the family First agenda. OK. And the for the for the fortnightly. Oh, my apologies. The monthly premium to cover is only for nine and a half, $1000 comes to $20.40.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's per month. And once you commence it, your premiums for your daughter on the screen of insurance, they are leveled, which means they're designed to stay the same as the week or older. And when she reaches the age of 85, her premiums will cease. So you won't need to pay any more premiums beyond your daughter reaching that age and she can still be covered up until she reach a hundreds old.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : I I'll be dead by then. I'll be, I'll be well then before they interrupt me. I'll be well then.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Oh, well, tech tech, uh, well, I, I guess if you're a little, Yeah, I, I get that.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : That'll be no problem. Not, not.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK. I, I, I get what you meant there as well. And I just realized as I was just saying that as well. Right. But like, but once, like when, when, when your daughter reaches age of 85, her premiums will cease.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So, like, there'll be no more umm, umm, payments for the insurance beyond that point, and your daughter can still be covered up until she reaches 100 years old. OK.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. And if they're supposed to happen after age 85, they're doing a 25% bonus cover. We will be paid on top of the benefit amount for the beneficiaries as well.
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Otherwise, umm, there's an early cash out option available for, uh, there's an early cash out option available for Zoe at any time after she reaches 85 years of age. At that point, she can choose to end the cover if she likes and we will pay her out 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. But that would be optional for her. So something to consider, which could provide some more flexibility with the funeral insurance with us later in life. OK. Yeah. And depending on how long the cover's in place for as well, they're saying you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. And please be aware, this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back. OK, Thank you. And the real reward on this cover is all Jane. So once the policy is in place with us for the 1st 12 months, we will refund you back 10% of your first use premiums back into your account. That comes to $24.48 that you can receive back at that point after the first 12 months.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK, so Yep. So I'll note down your details to you to let us know that you're the purchase and the payee as well. So I've got here, umm, uh, can I ask for you to confirm your first and last name as well, Jane please? Yep. Is that a PPLEB EE? And your date of birth as well?
[8 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Jane Appleby Yep, it's the fourth of the 10th.

[9 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So is the mother. Payee for this cover, Yeah. And also just in case, I'm Jenny. There was a policy in place as well. If you are replacing an existing policy with this cover, we recommend that you did not cancel that policy until you have received and reviewed a policy in full. And it may not be identical to your existing cover, just in case. So we'll note down your preferred payment method to, as always, insurance. Would you like to use a card or a BSP and account number? The Jane?
[10 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : It will have to be a Visa card please.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we can do that, yeah.
