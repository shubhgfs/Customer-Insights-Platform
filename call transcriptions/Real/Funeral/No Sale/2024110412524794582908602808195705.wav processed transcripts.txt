[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : My love place, right?
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. OK, sorry. For $15,000 of the funeral insurance rate with $45,000 of accidental serious injury, you're looking at a fortnightly premium for $31.36.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : That's for the top cover of the 15,000. So how is that one sounding? Where do you think you want to go from here? Did you want to have a look at? I'm just trying to have a look.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll yeah, that's right. I'll have a look and see what.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, did you want to go down to like the 14,000?
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : 14 and 13 if you don't mind.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : If you want to go down to the 11,000 and say that difference between 11 and 15, Yep, not a problem. Sorry. For 14,000, it's $29.27 per fortnight.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK, so it's not much.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, not too much difference here. Have you thought about what type of funeral?
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : OK, Not quite sure. I'd have to discuss it with the kids.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : I know something we like to think about, but whether it was information or burial, yeah, Yeah, not a problem. So according to the government's Money Smart website, private funerals, they typically customer in the region of $4000 for a basic information up to $15,000 for a more detailed burial service. So just depends on, you know, what you're after for yourself as well. And now did you want to have a look at the 13 or do you want to go a bit further from there?
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yeah, no, we'll go for saving them at 12 and it just gives me those options. Shall we?
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : All right, so the 13,000 is $27.18 per fortnight.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : And then I'm assuming that in between that the the 13 half and 14 half are sort of pretty much in between those amounts bracket wise. You know, like yeah, OK, so that's the exact and estimate though. That's not a problem.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, of course. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
[6 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : That's why I prefer just go the full amount and then I can just sort of and what was it, 12,000 Gorgeous.
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So the 12,000 is $25.08 per fortnight.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Alright, yes.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : No, you get. Yeah. OK.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : And then we'll just cap it there Cos we don't wanna go there.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Not a problem at all.
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. I mean, 'cause my mother's tuna cost me a lot of the money.
[6 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[6 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : A lot, lot money.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : 15 years ago it was, it was 15, nearly 20,000 back then.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Oh, wow. Yeah, of course.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : So yes, I don't.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yes, yes.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm just trying to be, you know, prepa, just something organised and these. Yeah, I do. It's crazy. So they're the fortnightly payments. Can you do monthly payments on those?
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So you know the cost of obviously, yes, funerals and yeah, yeah, yes, yeah. We you can do either fortnightly, monthly or you can do it annually as well.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So doesn't make the price difference here.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Can I have the so as as far as monthly, is it just the 3136 * 2 and that's gives you a monthly or is it less than that?
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it it doesn't work out like that. So I'm like I said, it doesn't make a difference over the umm, over the year.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep. Yeah, I think it comes that more expensive. Yeah, it's more that you pay more.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but I'll tell you what it would be so I because there's not exactly yes, there's not Yeah, well, you don't pay more over the year. Umm, it does it does sound like it's a little bit more because you're not exactly just times in it by the two, but it does work.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : No, Yes, yeah, no, that's it.
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : That is not exactly obviously, you know, 4 weeks and every month and because it's the 26 weeks and a fortnight. So if you go to I'll let you know the 15,000, sorry, that one would be for the month $67.94.
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, 6794. And what would it be? Yearly does anything it might be worth just paying yearly.
[8 minutes][Agent] : Yeah, Yep. So if you go you like I said, it works out to be the same over the year. It just depends on the frequency that you prefer to pay. Sorry, it's $815.25 for the 15,000.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK then.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : That's for the year.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Alright then. Awesome. Alright then.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Now the the cover also you provide you with an early cash out option. So anytime after you've reached 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover and we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefits. And then we provide you with a free online legal will valued at $160.00 with a policy and also a complimentary subscription of Australian Seniors Day magazine as well.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, OK, OK then. Alrighty. Alright.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So we include those As for you now. All right, let me just bring it up, sorry. And so we provide you with a the real reward. So following your first policy and the first rebate, we'll refund you 10% of the premiums you paid in that time. So that's what we offer here. So you get $81.53 back for the real reward there as well. So that's included. The Day magazine, that one's not included. It's the real, the real reward that we have here for you.
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : OK then, OK, OK, fantastic. Alright, yes. Well, what I wanna do is that do you get, do you, can you send in like emails out with information regarding everything that we've discussed or not?
[9 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we we send the information out to you.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So what we're able to do.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : No, no, that's sounding pretty good.
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So how was that with the 15,000 sounding suitable or was there another like what's the 15,000? Yeah. A month.
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, because if it's yeah, it is 6794 a month, so it's not too bad.
[9 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah.
[9 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : But I'm just thinking might even be cheaper just to pay the 3136 at fortnight by the look of it.
[10 minutes][Agent] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Doesn't make a difference.
[10 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So like I said, it doesn't make a difference whether it's fortnightly monthly or not or or annually.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Nah, whatever it is, it's just more, it's more affordable.
[10 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : I know it sounds, I know it sounds like it's more over the month, but when you work it out, when you work it out over the the year, it works out to be the same. So it really just depends if it's, if you have any, like any payment coming out on a certain day, for example, if it's on, you know, like umm, say I'm just going to give you an example on a Wednesday to come out every four and on a Wednesday.
[10 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, same time, yeah, Yeah, OK, yes.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So if you get paid on a certain day, you always get certain pays go in, then we can work it out.
[10 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : So just deduct it stuff on that day.
[10 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, that's exactly right. Yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : So what was the 14,000 yearly amount like?
[10 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So they 14,000 the yearly amount for that one, that one $760.90.
[10 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Alright, OK, OK, OK, alright. I'm just trying to work out what? No, no, I'm just alright. It's never might do Cos I wanna discuss a few things with the kids with it all. They'll wanna see what their preference is as far as would they prefer to cremate or Berry 'cause I'll be there. So that doesn't make a difference. So without being rude, I don't really.
[10 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, not too much difference between Yes, of course. Yes, Yeah. Yeah.
[11 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : It's more as the the factor of what they would prefer, you know, do they want to cremate so they can divide the ashes up and do what they would like to do with them or if it's, you know, they all do, they wanna. I'm very, very logic thinking.
[11 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[11 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : So I might sound a bit morbid.
[11 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : No, no, that's it.
[11 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : I'm not. It's just after going to that experience with my mum, it's very, I'd just like to because then there's always a discrepancy that I have with the siblings and someone to do this, someone to do that. And I was like, you know what, I just followed mum's instructions.
[11 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
[12 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : And So what I wanna do is discuss it, sit down with the kids and I wanna discuss it with them and then we can base it of how they feel and then I can go ahead. I mean, for the 15,000, it's not much anyway for the year. So if they feel comfortable with the fact that they may wanna do a burial, at least if I have that insurance in place, then it's available to them.
[12 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, of course.
[12 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : So yeah.
[12 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : And it's not something you need to if you decide on the 15,000.
[12 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So something you need to decide straight away whether you want a cremation or, you know, or a barrier is more when it comes to claims time. And the money will go to your beneficiaries. And then. Yeah. And then they're able to organize your funeral costs could be for unpaid bills, just whatever is going to make that time a bit easier there as well. And then, yeah.
[12 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : To the kids, yes yes, well, that's that's yeah, sorry. Go ahead.
[12 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : And, and then, no, that's OK. I was going to say. And that that's, you know, there's money left over there as well. If you decide, you know, to decommade, it ends up being less than they can do whatever they like with that remaining money as well. So then it's completely, completely up to them. Yeah.
[13 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK, it's up to them Alright then.
[13 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
[13 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Well, I might, I think this is something I need to put forward. Some are O open to hearing about it. The others, like we don't want to discuss it. I might.
[13 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. Yeah.
[13 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Well, it's important too because you just never know.
[13 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Especially at the ages they are as well.
[13 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Well, exactly. And like for me, I'm very illogic and you just never know what can happen. So. Well, I've charged so many curveballs that year that. Yes, so.
[13 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, that's exactly right.
[13 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : And my mum was not much older than me, so I want to.
[13 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Oh, wow. Yeah.
[13 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So she was down in 63.
[13 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah. Yeah, of course.
[13 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : So I just want to make sure that I have all my ducks in a row and everything is sorted for the kids and for my, you know, siblings and all that.
[13 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[13 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Do you guys also do seniors insurance as well?
[13 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : I'm so Sterlington. That's a different company. So yeah. Oh, OK.
[13 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK, because my father who's 88, I want to do something for him because I don't think anyone else has gone ahead in the family and organised anything. And we had a bit brief discussion, my siblings and I the other day and I went well, we don't want to get in the same predicament.
[14 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yes, of course.
[14 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : His mum was great.
[14 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : And how old did you say he was? 88? Yes.
[14 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : He's 88, very fit and healthy.
[14 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So our policy, they go from 40 to 70 to 79.
[14 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : All right, then I'll have to have a look and see what there is out there for him because he's super healthy. He's not the issue. So 98 year old trustee, he's got no medications. He's on. He's just still driving. He's still.

I know they're gonna creak **** ** but I'm gonna be like, hey, if you discussed, I'll just get the fields to see how they feel and then I can make that fin, like you said, I can make that final judgement, I guess as to the amount and whether, you know, if they also look, if they're sort of humming and R ING on what they would prefer, then I'll just make that choice of decision myself.
[14 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Unfortunately we wouldn't be able to help you out with him, but yeah, yeah, yeah. Not a problem, of course.
