And it can be used not only for funeral expenses but also for other final expenses like unpaid bills. If death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple. Or if you were to suffer an accidental serious injury before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, that benefit of that is also tripled.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, OK.

OK. So that's also there as well for your Peace of Mind. Now the level of cover does range, covers you from 3000 up to $15,000. Now, once you reach the age of 85 years, your premiums will cease. There's no further premiums you need to pay anymore.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.

[5 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : That's fine, 615157 OK, Yep. Mm.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, look at the 15,000 for you. No problem. Now the good news is also Michelle that your premiums are level, which means they are designed not to increase as you get older, OK? So you've got that Peace of Mind as well, OK?

[27 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Aye.
[27 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Hey, thank you. OK, And next question is how many episodes have you had which require treatment? The drop down list of answers here that you can select from our very first answer is one to two episodes. Then we've got 3 to 4 episodes, then we've got five to six episodes, then we've got 7 plus episodes. How many episodes have you had which require treatment? OK, just to make things a little.
[27 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : It's a ongoing treatment, so I don't know about exercise.
[27 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : That's fine.
[27 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[27 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Michelle, just to give you some insight here actually to help you out answer this particular question, I actually have a definition of what you mean by episode and it also comes with an example which I'll read out to you and then that way you can confirm your answer.
[28 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK, OK.
[28 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So when we say episode, an episode is an event, occurrence or reoccurrence of symptoms with increased severity from normal mood and usually require the inter either medical intervention, referral, treatment or alteration or adjustment to existing maintenance treatment. Treatment can take the form of medication and or counselling or therapy. I'll give you an example now. The example has three parts to it. So the very first part is if someone has mental health symptoms that require treatment, this is an episode. And if they return to their doctors several times to monitor the situation and offer pre prescriptions, this is the same single episode. So that's still all one episode right now.
[28 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[28 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : The second, second, second point is If however, they have a relapse or symptoms worsen or treatment needs to be changed or increased, then this constitutes a second episode.
[28 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep, OK.
[29 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : And the last point is that similarly if the applicant si. Similarly, if the applicant recovers and treatment stops and the applicant is fine, but at a later date symptoms return and they have to go back to the doctors, seek further advice. This would be a separate episode. OK. So based on that definition, that example, how many episodes have you had in quite treating, would you say? OK, perfect, thank you for that. And have you had symptoms or treatment for this condition within the last six months?
[29 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : OK, 3 treatment yes.
[29 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's fine. And have you ever seriously contemplated or attempted suicide? OK, thank you. Moving on to the next question, Any illegal drug use, abusive prescription medication or receive medical advice or counseling for alcohol consumption.

OK, I do, I, I, I also need to advise, uh, that the base on your disclosure within the application, the premium has risen to, uh, $44.42 a fortnight. Uh, that's based on, uh, two factors. The, uh, BMI was a factor and also, uh, the other factor was the mental health question that we just took you through as well.
[34 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, yeah. OK.
[34 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Uh, good news is you've been approved, but now we can tweak it around a little bit for you if, if need be. Is it sitting OK for you on this level so far?

[34 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Or would you like me to show you a few other options to lower that premium down if you like, Right. OK, let me find out exactly for you because I want you to be comfortable.
[35 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[35 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So let me that's you're welcome. That's fine. So the other one that we did for you was the funeral cover. Let's go there. OK, so that funeral cover 15,000. OK, so that one came in at $30.47 a fortnight. I'm going to tie them up for you and then you can confirm if we need to tweak the life insurance cover or not.
[35 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[35 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So the funeral cover is $30.47 and the life insurance cover now approved for the 250 amount is $44.42. Now if I was to combine those two figures together, we'll do that quickly for you. That works out to be $30.47 + 4442. OK. So it does total to a total figure of $74.89 every every two weeks, every fortnight.

[36 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So let's see what the two Hun. You're welcome. I see that $200,000 is that's it. Alright. So the difference is there the 200,000 OK, I'll just apply all your answers 200,000 there we go. Now that has been approved at the rate of OK, that one's come through now at $35.54 a fortnight. I'll just see what that total's to be for yourself.
[37 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[37 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : No worries. So works out to be $30.47 plus $35.54, total figure of $66.01 a fortnight.
[38 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : It's only, it's only $10, it's only $10 difference to going 250. So I might as well go 250 for fortnight rather than $10 difference.
[38 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : That's another option or we can go down lower uh, you've got two other options by the way Michelle, so umm you can go down to the one sure, whatever makes you comfortable, you know, so it's, you know umm so you'd rather stay with the 250? Is that what you're saying to me?
[38 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll, I'll definitely go 250, I think only being $10 difference. Yeah.
[38 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : All right, that's fine. Look later on, can I just say this too? Let's say that you've taken out coverage for 2:50 today. Uh, down the track you decide. Hang on, you know, you only need 200 or 150, for example, just give us a call back. Uh, and we could, uh, we could apply to reduce that level down to a level that is more comfortable for you.
