[38 seconds][Agent] : Yep, very water legal.
[31 seconds][Customer] : It's actually going back to my previous company, M Giles MGILES at Blue Water legal dot com dot AU.

[50 seconds][Customer] : That's it, That's it.
[56 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. Give me just a quick moment. OK, I've still got I've got 11 cross straight forward calling NSW 2444.
[1 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : That's it.
[1 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Is that correct?
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Alright, wonderful. OK, here we go. Now just in order to cancel the policy there, Michael, all we require is just a simple letter in writing. Before I give you those details, is there any particular reason that you weren't happy with the coverage anymore?
[1 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic, They're not requiring a pie anymore. Did you have any other cover to cover you if you don't presume what's to happen?
[1 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Well, too expensive and I don't require, look, I don't, I don't need to. I I've got about $5,000,000 thing so I don't need anything else. I I needed that for spearfishing and I didn't even realise that I had it. So it's gotta go.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Oh, sorry, sorry, no, look more than happy to give you the the cancellation instructions. Look, the only reason I do ask is because your life insurance policy, it's fully underwritten policy. So it was based on certain questions, health, lifestyle when you took it out. You've got Peace of Mind. We continue to cover you on that same application even if your health has changed since the application.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No, not at all.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Look, Yep, OK, that's good that your health hasn't changed, but some people do like to change the level of coverage and keep it as a top up in case your situation does change and you need that you have a need to coverage again. Just gonna throw it out there. If you did want some kind of coverage 100,000 instead of paying 200 and 6:45 because of 3851 a fortnight, they'll still give you an advance. The 10 thousandth a funeral they'll give you, still give you the terminal owner's advance payment.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Oh, actually, that's good. That sounds good. T talk to me about that.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so 100,000 cover would be $38.51 a fortnight.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : It's still keeping you on the same application, it's just changing the amount you're insured because you don't need that much coverage.
[3 minutes][Customer] : Oh, I I don't need the money.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : It would be yeah. Look, it have provided some owner's agreement. I know it's something we don't wanna think about, but if you would like, there's a 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner. You can actually 1200 thousand as a living benefit. So to get paid directly to you for anything you choose, you got better. You keep it when I'm gonna call you and I'll get back.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : If I'm dead, if I'm dead, if I'm dead, it's pretty hard to pay money to me.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : If you're terminally ill, we'll pay it to you. But if you pass away, it's 100,000 for the beneficiaries and and there's a 10,000 for any immediate cost that you, you know, for funeral.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : So the funeral thing I like. So talk to me about that.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Did you the funeral advance on the life insurance policy or a funeral policy you wanted to know about?
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Oh, well, the, the, the policy where, umm, you said first up, whatever that is for 38 bucks. What is that?
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Oh, so that's your life insurance that you've currently got. So you've got a 10,000 advance of the funeral included in the 100,000.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Mm Hmm, so, so So what, what's the $38,000 one? Oh, the $38 one.
