[1 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : e-mail is barbara.bottom@bigpond.com and there's two contact numbers.
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.

[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Five. Oh, yeah, that's fine. That's 588. That's fine.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Brilliant. And I how can I help you today? That's right.
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Now our policy only goes for the $6000 we both covered, both wife and I've covered for $6000.
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : That's right. Both yourself and Barbara.
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that that wouldn't bury us these days.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what do you want him to do?
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : You still there wasting?
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'm just listening. But what do you want to do with it?
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Well, I want to increase the benefit.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, now let me have a look because not all funeral insurance policies can be increased in the way that you're thinking. Let me just check because you we might be doing it as a top up policy instead. So let me just have a quick look.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, and also why you haven't a quick book.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : I've got a sum that's 4040 feet, 44 foot, oh, 44 at the moment. I wanted to try to put a fuel sign on that one as well. On the sum. He hasn't got anything at the moment so I thought it'd be a good idea to put it on the mine and just wait to pay to pay to come out of my my account. But why smell like that? Is that visible?
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep, it certainly is. That'll have to be done through our sales team though. So let's have a look at your policy 1st and then go from there.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : That's alright.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Alright, bear with me just a moment. OK, so you will be able to to increase this one. Now it's gonna set the the same benefit amount for yourself and for Barbara. Now the the level of cover you choose starts 3000 and it goes up to 15,000. Did you have a particular one that you want a quote for?
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I wanna waste 10. I'd pay. Is that for that?
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, it's fine. I'll bring up a quote for 10 to start with and we can go from there.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK, right here.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : All right, So 10,000, that'd be $68.27 a fortnight, and that still covers yourself and Barbara.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Well, that runs it up too. Well, you won't pay $23. That is, it's a pretty steady phrase, isn't it? Oh yeah.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : The reason for that is that the original policy would it be based on your age back in 2010, but adding something to it based on your age today. So there is a difference.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah, yeah, that's fair enough. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's that's sizeable enough too, you know, but but it would done. I'm I'll talk to me while I'm talking. Yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Alright, OK.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : It's the $10,000 each. Our premium would go up to $68. I thought that's not what it's because coordinate it. Yeah. Yeah. And I want the signer as as well as Karen. I want the funeral director who in the region. Oh, well, I'll give you. Yeah. Well, yeah, Yeah, Yeah. OK. Well, let's get to that point. I'm back here now. Yeah.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so if you're happy to proceed, what I'm going to do is a couple of questions, a bit of information I have to go over with you and then I can apply the increase over the phone, have a new policy schedule sent out for you. After we get that done, I'll get you through to one of our sales team and they'll help you out with your son's policy afterwards. OK.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. Well, can I put it under the same thing for me and all the rest of it?
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Uh, no, it'd have to be done as a separate policy because, uh, the AB so I could try to add it to you will cover the need to be between 2 and 17.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Oh well, yeah, yeah. Still paid it out of my account. I can't. Yeah. Yeah.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that'll that's fine because you'll be able to authorize the use of your account for that. It'll just have to be done as a separate policy. Sorry.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah, yeah. Have to be done a second policy. That's all right. That's not the problem.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : All right, all right, So what I'm gonna do for both yourself and for Barbara, can I just confirm that you're still an Australian resident?
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[6 minutes][Agent] : Yeah. All right.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I just thought you found on what, like the noise came up. Not like anything. Yeah, you can run through the Yeah, no worries. I'm listening. I'm listening to you through here and I'm not. I don't know whether which I'll take here and I'd out I'll just love opposite.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So I would also need to advise you that there is an exclusion on this policy, all right.
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, mine might be better there.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : All right, we'll see how we go, but if you need me to repeat or explain anything, just let me know, OK?
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : All right, so I just want to let you know that there is an exclusion on this policy now for this.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : What do you mean that's what's what's that mean?
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So for the, the increased amount. So for that six thou uh, so for the, the 4000 that we're adding to the policy for the 1st 12 months, you're covered against accidental death only after the 12 months it covers death due to any cause, including an accident.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So it's the same, same waiting period you would have done when you originally set up the policy, but you only do it for what you're adding to the copy. You don't really do it for everything.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Now why?
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it's down.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : It just means that we both got to wait for 12 months before we come into the 5th.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : That's right for the increased amount, but you'd still be covered for accidental death in the meantime.
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, but we still will be covering for the 6000 in the next 12 months too, wouldn't we?
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : That's right.
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's all right, mate. That's. I don't know what you mean.
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yep, now included in your cover is a cash out benefit. So once the oldest person covered under the policy counts 85, you have the option to cancel your policy and receive a cash out benefit of 50% of the funeral insurance benefit amount for one life insured.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that'd be a bit, Yeah. That'd be a bit silly kind of there.
[7 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Uh, the policy, uh, the policy, yeah. Well, it's basically it's, it's there if you need it, but you don't have to do it.
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So right now you do also get what's called the sum insured bonus. So once the oldest person covered under the policy turns 80, oh sorry, it turns 90, our premiums are no longer payable and you also get a 25% sum insured bonus on the funeral insurance benefit amount at no additional cost to you. So you're cover would go for 10,000 up to 12,500 in that case.
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Ah, yeah, ah, yeah, yeah, fair enough. And we cover inflation.
[8 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So as a, as an example, yeah, now, Yep.
[8 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Ah, yeah, fifty. Yeah. Oh, that's so nice. If you had to do it anyway.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Now from the age of 90, if you opt accounts you're covering, get that cash out benefit, it'd be 50% of the increased funeral insurance benefit amount for one life insured right now, like the the policy was originally the benefit amount and the premium amount will not increase annually. So they'll stay level for you.
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, I found the problem.
[9 minutes][Agent] : Alright, so, alright, so I'll just confirm that you're happy for me to increa increase the benefit amount on your policy today.
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, bye.
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so I've applied that for you. Now, when we do this, as I touched on earlier, we send out, it's called a change of insurance letter. Inside of the letter is an updated policy schedule. What we ask is that when you get it, have a look over it, make sure that the details are correct. If there's any issues, just give us a call, let us know.
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Right. Not a problem.
[9 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : All right, So I've applied all right, now with this as well. When we make a change to the policy, doesn't matter whether it's going up or going down, it affects it from your next regularly scheduled payment, which is still going to be the 16th of January would just be that 6827 a fortnight from now. All right, so that's all done for you, for your policy. I'm going to get you through to to one of our sales team to discuss the the application for your son's cover while I see he's available.
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's all right.
[9 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : I'll need to place you on a hold now, it's likely to take me more than a couple of minutes, but if you hold the line, I'll be as quick as I can.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : No worries. That's all right. Bye. No worries. Thank you.
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : All right, not a problem. Thanks for your time Colin. Please hold.
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : No worries. Thanks. Bye.
[12 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for your patience. I'm sorry for the delay, but I've got Tim on the line and he'll be happy to help you out from here.
[12 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Bye. Bye. Thanks. Bye.
