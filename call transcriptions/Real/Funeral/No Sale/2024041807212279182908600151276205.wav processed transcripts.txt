[1 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yep, no, but funeral that's Yep, absolutely.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Funeral.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : That's what I was after. Excellent. Darren, thank you so much. Umm, correct me if I'm wrong, no e-mail address for you and this is the best and only number as well. Is that right?
[1 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Excellent, thank you. Let me just open up your funeral policy. Umm, correct me if I'm wrong, Dary, you are wanting to cancel this policy. Umm, is that right?
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : That's why my colleague put down notes on. OK. Now with regards to cancellation, we do require cancellation request to be made in writing, but we can get to that in a SEC. So don't. If you don't mind me asking, you've held this policy since 2008. What's, uh, made you, uh, change your mind about the policy?
[2 minutes][Customer] : Just that I thought it was a bit better covered, which it isn't. So I'm just gonna go into mine. Well, it's only paying 5 grand. Yeah, it's 15 grand. When I know that it's just the way it's sort of written up. It's like it was different. Yeah.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : All right, you know, you can go to top. You can because you've had this policy since what's 2008.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : What was that 15 years now coming up to 15 years, you know, instead of having to cancel it, have you considered maybe doing a top up cover for the difference of the 10,000? So this so you go ahead.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : No, because because a lot of them when you read into them, they only go to a certain age and then they won't pay the money. So if I live past a certain age, you you don't get nothing back off you or nothing anyway. So there's no point being being in. If I do my own, I can just get the money out when you want.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : No, but not, not with us, not not. I think there's a misunder with us. That's a misunderstanding. Let me bring up your policy and I'll explain to you. So with us, once you get to a certain age, umm, the what can it be? Either you stop paying uh, for the print that you still get covered, but you stop paying for it. Umm, or that we pay you and give you what you're covered for. Give me one second. Let me bring up your one and I'll tell you exactly how your one works.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, Won't be a SEC with us. It doesn't stop stop you from being insured. So give me one second. All right. So obviously, OK, here we go. So it's a catch benefit to pass away. If this was due to an accident, the benefit amount is tripled. Now here we go alright, so bit of information OK on this one, but uh, I can dive into it further after reading it if you don't understand exactly what it means, OK. Umm, Now once the oldest person covered under the policy turns 35, you have the option to cancel your policy and receive a cash up benefit, 50% of the funeral insurance benefit now for wildlife insured. Uh, once the oldest person covered under the policy turns 90, premiums are no longer payable. Uh, and you'll also receive a 25 percent, uh, some insured bonus on the funeral insurance benefit at no additional cost to you from the age of 90. If you're up to cancel, you cover and receive the cash up benefit will be 50% of the increased funeral insurance benefit amount for wildlife insured. OK. Do you want me to explain that better?
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I know you, man.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : If we'd like to break it down exactly what it means, yeah. So you still get covered even up after the age of 90. So after the age of 90, we're not you're not paying no more, but you still are covered.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, Yeah.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, So now, and pretty much all our policies have that.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Well, what happens if what happens if you die before that age?
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So you still. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : It's a little good tooth, Yeah.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : That's not you. You, well, you served out your waiting period because that waiting period is 12 months. You've voluntarily served that out. Umm, you know what I mean? And you've paid, I think my colleague tried to give you this before you. You've paid.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, $3557 there.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So you know, that's yeah, that's right. So you still are covered.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Umm, if you wanted to be like if you wanted to be 15, you can. I can put you on to one of my colleagues and they can help you get that top up cover for the extra $10,000.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So what what I ruled is that cost.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Umm, I have a look.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : So do you know, as you as you get older, as you get older, do you pay more into it? Oh, you probably what?

[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it doesn't. It does not increase at all. Your one stays at $10.70 for this one. Even if you were to take up another one like the the $10,000, I couldn't tell you. Well, actually I might be able to tell you a price. Hold on, give me one second.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
