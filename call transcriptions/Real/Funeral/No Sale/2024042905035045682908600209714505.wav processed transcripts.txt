[11 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.

[11 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic. Thank you. And umm, she's can I confirm that she is a female strained resident and she's your mother now the contact number there for her would be the same as the one you've just given me for your father.
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, please.
[11 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's fine. And the e-mail address for her.
[11 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Monthly, Yes, Thank you.
[11 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : I'll, I'll put the same one that you've given me for your father as well and the address uh, for her would, would make the postal address the same the one you gave me as well.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yes, thank you.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Just making sure that's fine. Thank you for that.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : You're welcome.
[12 minutes][Agent] : OK, I've got both now your father and mother Day on the system. Umm, now let's go through the cover itself. I explained to you how it works and we can go through several options available.
[12 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : None.
[12 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, so basically with the funeral insurance cover, the way it works today, Anna, it provides a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to your loved ones when when they pass away. And they can use those funds not only for funeral expenses but also for the final expenses like unpaid bills. And you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this benefit amount. And if death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple. OK, now the next the next benefit is only available for your mother. And that benefit is in addition before her policy anniversary following her 75th, 75th birthday because your father is above the age of 75. If she were, if she were to suffer an accidental serious injury such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, will that benefit now, but also triples? That'll obviously cover her up until her, uh, before her policy anniversary following her 75th birthday for that extra benefit.
[13 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[13 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK, now it's easy to apply because there are no medical checks. Acceptance is guaranteed if they are strained residents aged between 18 and 79, which you've already confirmed then. And just so you know, for the 1st 12 months they will be covered for accidental death and for your mother and accidental serious injury only for your mother. After the first 12 months you will they will be covered to death due to any 'cause as well. In addition to that, they, in addition to that, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if if they were first diagnosed with a terminal illness for 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, then we'll pay out their claim in full to help with things like medical expenses. OK, so that's also their result. Now you can choose amounts between 3000 up to $15,000 for each of them. Just a couple of things to note. Your premiums are level, which means they're designed to stay the same as they get older and when they reach the age of 85 years, your premiums will cease. So you no longer need to pay premiums anymore and you'll automatically receive or they automatically receive a 25% bonus cover. This will be applied to their benefit amount on top so they're insured for 25% more as well. At that point in time. This cover provides them with an early cash at option. So with any time after they reach the age of 85 years, they can choose to end their cover and we'll pay them 75% of the fee insurance benefits. And this obviously applies to both of them even if they have the blood plan. So with this cover as well, you may pay more in total premiums of the life of the policy than a benefit amount. Please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment elements. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back. Just be mindful of that as well. OK, so let's go through some pricing together.
[15 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : None.
[15 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : As I mentioned, for both your father and mother levels of cover available, it ranges from 3000 up to $15,000. Umm, so we can go through some options here first. So what benefit amount would you like me to look at first to look at several options. Where would you like to start first? From 10,000 each? Let's start there. From here, you can gauge whether you want to go up or down from here depending on your budget as well.
[15 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : I would like to start from the 10,000 E OK.
[16 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, all right, that's fine. Now, if you chose now the premiums are calculated based on their age and the announce you're choosing, OK? So keep that in mind. So for example, your father, you'd be looking at paying $75.91 a fortnight for him. For your mother, you're looking at paying $68.68 a fortnight for her. So therefore together total figure of $144.59 a fortnight combined and that's both your mother and father covered at $10,000 each. Now, I've got a question for you. If you have a budget that you would like to stick to, what would that be? See what I can do for you. I mean, if you say to me, Alfred, I don't want to be paying more than a certain amount the fortnight, what would that be?
[17 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : And then $100 per night.
[17 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, we're not far off then. Umm. So let's have a look at what I can do here. I'll take things around for you and see what I can do. OK, Around about $100. Let's see. Alright, I'm going to present you with a few options and then you can decide what's best.
[17 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : OK. Thank you.
[17 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, so if you pay a total figure of $101.22 a fortnight, they can offer each of your parents $7000 each, OK, Umm, but further to that, remember when when they turn 85, you no longer need to pay premiums anymore? There's no more premiums, policy remains active and they also receive a 25% bonus cover on top of the 7000. So therefore, let's look, let's work that out, $7000 + 25%, that'd be covered for almost 9000. So it's $8750 for each and you're not paying premiums up from that point onwards. How does that sound if you can stretch your budget a little bit more, right? I'll just give you another option. If if you were to look at even say 8000, for example, I'll just see what the difference is there. If you chose 8000 to your parents instead of seven for each of them, right, You'd be paying $115.00.
[19 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : None.
[19 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : It's an extra $15.67 a fortnight. OK, so it's an extra $15.67 a fortnight extra. That would be covered to $8000 each and therefore, if you made that calculation up until they, they turn 85, uh, that $8000 plus $0.25, that's another 2000. Therefore, from that point onwards, they're covered for $10,000 each and you're not paying premiums beyond the age of 85. What should you also receive from us, by the way, is the reward that we attached to their policies that that means that following your first policy anniversary date, we're going, you're going to get a refund from us as a cash back benefit.
[19 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[19 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Now, based on the figures I'm seeing here, that refund happens to be $300.76 back into your back into your pocket. How does that sound? So which one's better though, the 7000 or the 8000 for you so far? What are you thinking?
[20 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it is. It's the premium gonna be increased every year or it's gonna be pay to pay.
[20 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : That's the beauty of our products. Now, it's a good question. I, I mentioned to you that your premiums are level, which means they're designed to stay the same as you as they get older.
[20 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Let me see. Oh, OK.
[20 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So they're designed to stay the same as they get older, OK. What are you thinking, the seven or the 8000 for each of them?
[21 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Can you, can you, can you give me I could do for 10,000 for the 10,000 months each Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[21 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : You want to look at the 10,000? Yeah. All right. So if you were to look at the the 10,000 each, is that what you're saying? All right. If we did 10,000 each, I remind you again what that was, that came down to a total figure of $144.59 a fortnight. So it's $44.59 a fortnight above the budget that you mentioned, $100, OK. And also look, if you were to consider the 10,000, the 10,000 would also mean that when they reach 85, therefore they get an extra 25% on top, which is the 2 1/2 thousand. Therefore, each of them at that point in time would be covered for 12,500.
[21 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : No, OK. Yeah, yeah. I'm seeing like, I'll go with that one, yes.
[21 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Five $100 each for the 10,000, OK, The refundable amount is also more. So you do because it's based on the percentage and that's that percentage is 10%. So it works out to be 378. Sorry, $375.94 You get back as a refund following your first policy initial date.
[22 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[22 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, all right, well, we'll do that for you. It's no problem. So what I'm happy to do right now is provide them with immediate cover. We send these policy documents out to you right away. You'll get a soft copy that goes to your e-mail address shortly, usually within 15 minutes. Plus we also post them out to you to your postal address as well. OK. And if you have any questions, you also notice that my name and my numbers are there for you, so you can certainly reach out for myself directly.

Now here with real insurance, we generally collect payment within the next 7 days. When within the next 7 days would be more suitable for you. OK. Oh OK.
[23 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : I'm getting paid today and I wanted to, yeah, I wanted to take on the the year, the payday.
