[4 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Now, before, before I start, before I start listening, when do I actually join in? Because I'll be 80 in March.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yes, correct. So you would need to have this pop up policy before you turn 80.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that would be early, early March.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Ah, ah, well, well, your birthday is on the 16th of March.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. Yeah.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So so long as you take up this policy before you turn 80th because once you reach 80, you can no longer apply for few for this insurance.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : You need to have the insurance before your 80th.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, so, so, uh, again, how, how the cover works. So I can see you've had your insurance with us now, umm, for quite some time. It's been almost 20 years, uh, since 2008.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Hold on.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : It, it's been a long time there or roughly fi 1515 years.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Well, oh, that would be that would have been more than 5000. I want it.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Well, it's been a long time. And since then we have updated our funeral insurance covers. So what I'll do for you is I'll take you through how the new cover works. We've just adjusted it, added in a few features and benefits for you. So I'll take you to how those works and jump in. Don't be shy. If you have any questions, just let me know. OK.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, bye.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Thank. Thank you so much. But if you do mind me asking, you mentioned at the start you're currently insured for 5000. You feel what? That that's not sufficient for your expenses at the moment. You feel it might cost a bit more than that or Sure. Yep.
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : You see what happen is when I die, my daughter be taking care of it, but because 5000 I don't think it'd be sufficient.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : I hope so too. Touch wood. Yeah, Hope you do. Would be nice.
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : I well, to be honest with you, I want to lift 100 and I'm and I'm still working at my age.
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Oh, wha. What do you do? I think you're the only I Yeah, I think you're the only 79 year old person I've ever spoken to that's still working. Good for you, Sally.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : OK, well I look at the uh cold check out and check out yeah, because as I'm not re ready for retirement.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Well done. Good on you. Well, appreciate you letting me know this. So. So again, SH, when the time does eventually come, you feel your current 5000 may not be enough for your daughter to cover your expenses.
[6 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh.
[6 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So you're just wanting to look at extra cover just to give her that security. Is that right? Yeah. Good on you.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, you see what happened now with my husband.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Got you.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : I I have keep him paying for it's 15,000 when I when he reached 85, which is Med of two months or yeah, two months. Yeah.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : And I was hoping that I can get into the same category, but the lady told me that that policy is gone. It's no longer exists.
[7 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yes, as I mentioned, we have updated our funeral insurance since since then. So as I said, I'll quickly just explain it to you. You'll see for yourself. It is really, really simple. But if there is anything that's unclear, don't be shy to just jump in and ask me, OK? It'd be my pleasure to clarify things for you, Sally.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK, Right. OK. Thank you.
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : My pleasure. But at the end of the day, what you will notice is it's a guaranteed acceptance. So this means we will accept you as you are. You won't need to visit a doctor. You won't need to do any nasty blood tests or fill out any forms. Basically, since you are, since you are in Austra, just confirming because Y you're a female and an Australian resident, you're 79 years old. Is that all correct?
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah. Hmm. Mm.
[8 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Perfect. Well, since you're an Australian resident and you're in that age group, we will accept you just the way you are without looking at your medical history whatsoever, OK.
[8 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : But I'm I'm pretty fiddled how they say it.
[8 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : He is Alvin, which is great.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Good for you, especially if you're still working. Good.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Thank you.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Good on you, but please keep in mind that because of this reason as we're gonna accept you the way you are without looking at your medical history.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm. OK.
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Sally, just please keep in mind that for the 1st 12 months you'll only be covered for accidental death only, but after the first 12 months it will cover death from due to any cause at all.
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, great. Now in addition to this, we'll also include what we call a terminal illness benefit for you, which of course I'm really hoping you never get to use this. But great Peace of Mind. Exactly. Hopefully never, but great Peace of Mind knowing it is included for you just in case, because life is so unpredictable.
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : I hope not, yeah.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : And this does mean that after you've held the policy with us for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by medical practitioner, we will then pay your full funeral insurance to you before you pass so you can actually use them on yourself however you like.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : I don't want that to happen. I want.
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's, let's hope not. Now you can actually select with the new funeral insurance any amount of cover you'd like between $3000 up to a maximum of 15,000.
[9 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : I want, yeah.
[9 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : But a couple of very important things I wanna make sure you understand, seriously, whichever amount you end up choosing, the cost that I'm about to work out for you today.
[9 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : What you'll notice is we've designed the premiums to to remain the same for you year on year as you get older, from now until you reach 85 years old, OK, Once you reach 85 years old, Sally, what you'll notice is firstly, the premiums will cease altogether. You will no longer have to pay your insurance anymore once you turn 85.
[10 minutes][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[10 minutes][Agent] : And as a reward for staying with us for so many years, we will also reward you with the extra bonus 25% cover. We just add that on to your insurance as a thank you.
[10 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Yes.
[10 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So for example, if you're insured for $10,000, once you reach 85, it'll convert automatically to 12,500 at no additional cost to you. OK.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm. Yeah.
[10 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : You can also find some information about upgrade instruction on the website as well. You do want to have a look at that yourself.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm hoping that. I'm hoping. Yeah.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : But finally, Sally, no worries.
[10 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Mm Hmm.
[10 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's OK. Well, last thing to consider, 85 is a long time away. Who knows what your situation will be then.
[10 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So we do also provide you with a an option to cash out of the insurance. And this option is voluntary. It's up to you.
[10 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm. Mm hmm.
[10 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : But should you want to, anytime after your 85th, you could choose to end the insurance altogether and cash out 75% of the funeral insurance benefit, which will then pay out that to you and the policy will then end. OK.
[10 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : OK. Mm hmm.
[10 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : But please don't forget, as I mentioned earlier, if you don't cash out, if you keep the insurance in place, remember once you turn 85, you won't be paying for it anymore.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : The insurance will still carry on, but your premiums will stop and you'll also be rewarded with that bonus 25% cover as well. OK, perfect.
[11 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : OK, now this this this product you're talking about is 1010 thousand.
[11 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Now you can choose. So in the minimum is 3000 up to a maximum of 15,000. I can do anywhere in between. It's up to you, Sally.
[11 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Is it OK?
[11 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah. So we can go ahead and bring up some pricing for you. Now, just before I do that, I just wanna make sure that I've explained that all clearly for you. No, no questions. It's all pretty straightforward.
[11 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Hmm. Mm.
[11 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you. Well, what amount would you like to look at first? Again, the minimum is 3000 and it goes up in 500 dollar amount. So three and a half 4004 1/2 up to a maximum of $15,000 there, Sally.
[11 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Now if it's if it's 15,000, how much do I pay?
[11 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yep, let's have a look. I'll work it out for you.
[11 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Fortnitely, yeah.
[12 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So if you go for the maximum 15,000 for this extra top up policy, you'll be paying for this insurance a fortnightly payment of $196.68 a fortnight.
[12 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : And what about the 10,000?
[12 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Let's see. So if we bring it to 10,000 now per fortnight, that'll come to $131.12 a fortnight. That's a bit more manageable for you.
[12 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : That is much better, yeah.
[12 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : If you mind me asking, Sally, with your existing insurance, would you be able to keep up with this payment as well? That would be manageable to have both of them. Yep.
[12 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, because I, because what happened is now when my husband hit February, the I that's his birthday, and then I don't have to pay anymore. So. Because.
[12 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Ah, got you.
[12 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[12 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Because he turns 85, is that right?
[12 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[12 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[12 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : So that's one thing on mine. So I should.
[12 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure.
[12 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : MMM, yeah.
[12 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, perfect. Well, if that would be manageable for you.
[13 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[13 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Now there are a couple more additions we include on top for you and for your family. Firstly, for yourself, Sally, have you arranged your will? Have you got one set up at the moment?
[13 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : She never did all I all I did was on my, I passed away.
[13 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[13 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : My daughter, her name is there, uh, that she will claim the money for my funeral.
[13 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Sure, sure. So with regards to the benefit, your daughter being the beneficiary, that's separate to the will. So this this will be actually included for free for you. It's valued at 160 dollars. OK. And that'll come with your policy for free. That's separate to nominating your beneficiaries.
[13 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Uh, yes. Mm. Hmm.
[13 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, so so that'll that'll give you some reassurance. If you haven't already got one set up, you can organize that in your own time. It'll come for free for you, Sally.
[13 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[13 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : SEC.
[13 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : What? What what What did you say? Free for me?
[13 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Secondly, a will.
[13 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[13 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : A will, A legal will.
[13 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[13 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So you can write down your belongings. So when you pass away, you you can leave your belongings to whoever you wish. OK.
[14 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that. That's OK. You're already paying a range.
[14 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that's been arranged. Perfect. All good. Well, you can pass this on to a friend or family member then, if you like. But it will still be included for free for you. We'll keep it as a spare if you like.
[14 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yes, because I've got three children.
[14 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : It's up to you huh?
[14 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : I've got three children and they were just set up because they said they don't really want anything, just everything is done.
[14 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Nice good for you. Awesome Well another thing which we'll actually give back to you Sally's once you've held our funeral insurance with us for a year.
[14 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[14 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Once you hold this policy for 12 months time following your policy anniversary, we will refund you back 10% of all the payments you paid into it.
[14 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Uh huh.
[14 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So based on the 10,000 you'll get back next year following the first four months anniversary, we'll refund you a total of $340.91 as it. Thank you.
[14 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[14 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK and and finally, last thing to keep in mind, let your family know that if your death was caused by an accident, we will end up tripling the payout. So instead of 10,000, your family will receive $30,000 in total for this policy if death was caused by an accident there, Sally.
[15 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. OK.
[15 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK, great. Fantastic. So if you feel that amount is right, just checking in with you, you wouldn't want me to quote you on maybe anything lower than the 10,000 that is comfortable and manageable for you.
[15 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Well that one will be fine.
[15 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Perfect.
[15 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : But I hope, I still hope by that's how I still, I still feel I can still work.
[15 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Well, if that's right for you, oh, well, I hope you do that. That'll be amazing. Good for you. Now Sally, I'll just let you wear a couple of final things that you may be more in total premiums over the life of the policy and then the benefit amount. And please be aware that this insurance does not have a savings or investment elements. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you won't receive anything back. So I do need to just make sure that you either explain that to you. OK.
[16 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : That's OK. Mm hmm.
[16 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : And finally, can I verbally confirm with you that you are happy to to continue and organise to get this top up in place?
[16 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Now tell me umm, if I can join just in March, is that OK?
[16 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : In March, we'll keep in mind, keep in mind Sally, I wouldn't be able to push it out that far. No, the on my end, the furthest I can set up the first payment date will be a month's time from today's date.
[16 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : The early March OK, as long as it is 16 of February it's fine because then I don't have to worry about my husband's. He is already in case.
[16 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : A A again from from today's date, the maximum would be a month's time, so I could push it up to the 17th of January. Would be the furthest on my end there, Sally.
[16 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Oh, seventeen. That would be next.
[16 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because what the, Because the way we set it up for you, yeah, there'll be a month's time. So basically what we do for you is if you're happy to continue, we don't take any payments out today, but we do get the policy in place. So you're covered immediately and we let you select a day in the future when you'd like for the payments to start.
[17 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : OK, that's fine.
[17 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So again, on my end, the furthest I can push it out is up to a month's time from today, which if I bring up the calendar will be the 17th of January, will be the furthest I can push out that first payment date, Is it?
[17 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that'll be all right.
[17 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Would that be OK for you?
[17 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
[17 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Thanks. Thanks for understanding, Sally. So I'll just make sure it is the 17th, not the 18th. Give me one second.
[17 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Mm, Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Mm.
[17 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : I'll just double check that for you right now because I, uh, so yeah, 17th of January falls on a Friday And, and yes, that would be the, the fur the latest I could push out the payment date.
