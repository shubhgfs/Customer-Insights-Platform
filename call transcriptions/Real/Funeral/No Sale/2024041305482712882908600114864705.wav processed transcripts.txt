[40 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thanks for confirming that there for me, Sharon. And I'd like to remind you that all calls are recorded and any advice I do provide today is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation there.
[51 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So we were just running through the quote there with you for the $15,000 of cover. Did you have a chance to hear the price or did it just drop out before it comes through there?
[59 seconds][Customer] : I'm, I think you said 30 something dollars.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it was coming in at $37.96 per fortnight for that, umm, $15,000 of cover. So, yeah, in terms of suitability and the portability there, Sharon, how is that $15,000 sounding? That sound OK?
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I sound OK. I'll still have to think about it though.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : I still have to think about that. Yeah, of course. Well, if it is sounding OK there Sharon, what we can do here is we have umm, so we can get that one put in place for you while you have a look over your documents and decide if it is right for you. So with this one here, Sharon, it has a 30 day cooling off. So you can have a look over your documents, decide if it is right for you while being in that cooling off. So yeah, you don't have to pay any premiums upfront. And if you decide the policy isn't right for you, it's just as simple as yeah, giving us a call and letting us to know. And any premium you would have paid as well within that 30 days will be refunded in full unless the claim has been made there. So with your insurances, Sharon, do you prefer to set them up with direct debit or credit card? What works best for you? OK and with this one here, was that a savings or a cheque account that you had?
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Must be T cab savings.
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : I do just need to pop down an address here. Could I start with your post code 3214? And what suburb was that? Alright, so that's CRIO perfect. And what was the address for that one, Reynolds? And is that the same as your postal address, Sharon?
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : 3214 Cry Yeah 23 Granald Parade Yeah.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So like to let you know here. With that coverage, you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. So please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you're not receive anything back. I'm not sure I owe you before and choose that early cash back option there so.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : I was wondering also how much would it cost for a $35,000?
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So maximum we can offer you here is 15,000. So that $15,000 and $37.96, it is sounding like a suitable amount there for you, Sharon. Yeah, sounds OK. Yes, perfect. So we'll get this one put in place for you without having to pay anything upfront. So you can have a yeah read over your documents while being covered there.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sounds OK savings.
