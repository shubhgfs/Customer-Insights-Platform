[2 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Just Please note our calls are recorded and any advice we provide general in nature may not be suitable for your situation. So if you don't mind me asking, uh, what sparked the interest up looking into the funeral coverage for Brett? Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I've had a funeral coverage with you for about 5 years now and I'm, you know, I say to him, why don't you go and, you know, make one, you know, you know, ring up and Oh yes, I'll get to it. I'll get to it. He never does. So I put myself, well, that's why I just asked if I could do it.
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, no problem. So yeah, you can actually take it out on his behalf. That's completely fine.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, you know.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I'll explain to you how it will work for Brett and then we can now run through the pricing. Yeah, if you've got any questions, just stop me. OK, So I'll let you know. Firstly, it is very simple and how the funeral coverage will work for Brett Vicky. So at the end of the day, it's designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones in the event that Touchwood something was happened to yourself. OK. But in this case, now the way that we do, that's through a lump sum payment of between $3000 up to $15,000 depending on your personal needs. But with the coverage as well, it does also include an accidental death benefit. So because accidents also unexpected and potentially very sudden, we understand that could always be other costs left behind for your loved ones. You know, things like unpaid bills. So we'll pay out a three times benefit and you enter an accidental death just to make sure that any additional expenses that do come up can be taken care of as well.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes, OK.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Now the coverage, it's a guaranteed acceptance policy, so he doesn't have to go through any medical checks. Just for the 1st 12 months, he'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months, he'll be covered for death due to any cause.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, OK. OK.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminally illness benefit, which means after holding the policy for 12 months, if he was first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a registered medical practitioner, we'll actually payout the claim in full in that situation so that he can get the birth medical care or anything else you might need now as well as that week. This policy, once he reaches the age of 85, the premiums actually stop. So you don't pay anything after the age of 85. We will still continue to cover cover Brett there, and we'll actually increase his level of cover by 25% as well, OK. Also, at the age of 85, you do have the option to cash the policy and say you can like to end the cover and we'll pay out 75% of the benefit amount. And is premiums a level which means that designed not to increase as you get older. So the younger he takes the policy out in general, the cheaper it is. And then it's designed not to get more expensive as he gets older as well.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, OK.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, now we'll run through the pricing here, Vicky. So you can choose from $3000 up to $15,000 cover. How much were you looking to cover uh, Brett for?
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : I'm not sure how much mine is. I'd pay $50.00 a month, no fortnight I think. I think it, I'm not sure how much I'd pay for mine, but I would it be 11,000 or 12,012 thou, Yeah.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : 11 to 12,000 OK 12,000 OK well I can start at $12,000. You can let me know what you think.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : OK, and what about if it was 15?
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Umm, So Brett, if we're looking at $12,000 uh, funeral coverage, which will include the, uh, $36,000 accidental death coverage in the $12,000 uh, terminally ill advanced payment, all up that you'd be looking at a fortnightly premium of $32.65, 15 Yeah, up to the $15,000 funeral coverage still includes uh, 45,000 accidental death in the 15,000 term illness. That'll bring it to you fortnightly, $40.82.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : How much was the other 130? Probably just that one.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So the 12,000, it was uh, sorry, uh $32.65, just a 12.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : For now I think I'm just trying to work out my phone in my head.
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no problem. We can do the 12,000 for now. If you want to increase it in the future, you can just give us a call and apply to take up the extra coverage.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I'll probably I'll probably eventually do that if it just took just book for both of them actually, because but this for now, that's what I'm just trying to yeah, I'm just saying yeah, trying to work out. Yeah, yeah. Otherwise if I can't afford it, that's no so I'm not.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, just for now, the 12,000, yes, no problem. OK, but you think the 12,000 would be suitable in your current situation? Yep.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : I think so, because we were that I was going to have, you know, like very own will have a joint, you know, like plot, you know what I mean?
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Well, probably if I go for it, it's probably more for me because I'd have to buy the whole they'd have to buy the whole thing.
