[1 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Robert Fullerton, 15954.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So just to begin with, so I can create a profile for you, can I confirm please your full name and date of birth 5954?
[1 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : And just to triple check, so that's RABERTFULLERTON 280. And so I confirm that you're a male Australian resident. Too easy. So what we'll do for you. So I understand that you have umm, looked at cover before for umm, umm, your partner. So what we'll do is I'll run through how the cover works. Umm, just rehash how that works. Umm, if you have any questions, feel free to jump in, stop me at any point umm, And then we'll have a look at some quotes, find something suitable to help get set up for yourself. Umm, But all I get that umm loaded up as mentioned in terms of what you're actually covered for. So for the 1st 12 months, you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. And then after the first 12 months, you'll be covered for deaths due to any cause.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And then in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you're first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner in a very unfortunate case, we pay the funeral insurance yet to you in full. So you get it while you're still alive to help with things like medical costs as well as that way you can plan for the future accordingly with loved ones.
[3 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Now of course, Rob, included in the cover is an early cash out option, which means any time after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover if you do pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. Lastly, of course, you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy then the benefit amount. So just please where this insurance is not of a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you not receive anything back unless you're eligible for and choose that early cash back. But of course, we'll be late to pick anywhere from 3000 to 15,000 for yourself to be covered for.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, 12,000.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Did you have an amount in mind that you were wanting to be covered for for the 12,000? Perfect, and I've got the quote loaded up before we go through that, was there any questions so far? All sounding pretty straightforward.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, it's pretty, pretty well right.
[4 minutes][Agent] : Too easy. Well, today for the 12,000 level of cover we'll be looking at for yourself, $55.83 per fortnight. And the great thing is that your premiums are designed to stay the same each year rather than going through yearly increases.
[4 minutes][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
