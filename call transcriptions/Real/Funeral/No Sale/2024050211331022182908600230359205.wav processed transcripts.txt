Was that right?
[11 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : It will be 9 Yes at Hotmail dot com Yes, it's wilson.williams@hotmail.com yes, yes, my first.
[12 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : And how do I spell that again? Sorry about that. Yep. wilfordyeswilfordwilliams@hotmail.com. OK, so I'll quickly take you through the funeral cover. Any questions as well? Still still applies. Don't be afraid to ask any questions. OK.
[12 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : It's Wilfred OK.
[12 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : All right, so our cover is designed to provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to her loved ones. So her being Marie, of course, when she passes away, they can use the funds not only for funeral expenses, but also any other final expenses like unpaid bills. She can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this benefit amount and if death is due to an accident, her chosen benefit will triple. In addition, before the policy anniversary following her 75th birthday, if she were to suffer an accidental serious injury such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit amount will also triple. So it's easy to apply. There are no medical checks and acceptance is guaranteed if she is an Australian resident aged between 18 and 79. And just so you know, for the 1st 12 months she will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months, she will be covered for death due to any cause.
[13 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : None.
[13 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding her policy for 12 months, if she was first diagnosed with the terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay her claim in full to help her with things like medical expenses. Does that all make sense so far? That's good to hear. And so for her, the age, she can choose between $3000 up to $15,000. And a couple things to note, she uh, her cover also provides her with an early cash option. So any time after she reaches 85 years of age, she can choose to enter cover and we will pay her 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. And her premiums are level, which means they are designed to stay the same as she gets older. And when she reaches the age of 85, low premiums will cease. So she'll have nothing more to pay and she'll also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover applied to her benefit amount. OK. So just from that $3000 up to $15,000 there, what level of cover would you like to take a look at firstly for Maria?
[13 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it does. Well, it won't be the same, but it's probably about $10,000.
[14 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : What was that, 3010 thousand?
[14 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : It was still about 10,000 because fuel expenses is quite expensive now this.
[14 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Completely understand that. No worries.
[14 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : So yes, I, I think it's, that's about because I know a friend of mine is lifetime when it came down to $12,000.
[14 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. MMM.
[14 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Sir.
[14 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And my condolences. They. I'm sorry to hear about that as well.
[14 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[14 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : They're Wilford.
[14 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : No, that's OK.
[14 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, but I'll let you know. For $10,000 of cover, Maria's premium will be $19.23 per fortnight.
[15 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, it is.
[15 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm. That's good to hear. And we have a real reward attached to the policy. So following her first policy anniversary date, we will refund to a 10% of the premiums she has paid in that time, and we will send her a free will kit valued at $30.00 with each policy. So was that? Was it 10? Oh yeah.
[15 minutes][Customer] : OK, OK, so so so I don't want the Internet. I don't just a question.
[15 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Mm, Hmm, yeah.
[15 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : So the policy I've got now also, it's like with where I've got myself, my ex-wife and my my kids, OK, I've I've got the little one between my account wife and I always got one together and it's only 34 next year. But where do I put him on and to it's it's the policy now. Do I have to pay save for the other whatever I need to add? Is it separate policies should I have to take out for them or is it all together?
[15 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So it'd be a separate policy as umm, as there, there, there are different people there as well. Yep.
[16 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK, so each one needs to have a separate policy? Is that what you're saying? I can't bundle them together?
[16 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Is that well, mm, hmm, yeah, that's correct.
[16 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[16 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And are you happy to do that as well?
[16 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, I just thought I can bundle them because we are family.
[16 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[16 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : You don't bother.
[16 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : And I perfectly understand.
[16 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : I just have the one payment but everything is bundled together like what I'm what I'm on or what I'm on now.
[16 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Mm Hmm. Oh, no, I completely understand. Let me double check that with my manager just so I can explain that best to you as well.
[16 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : So I just pay the one amount if it's for all of it, yes.
[16 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Umm, I see. As to why that umm, what's the process with that as well? OK, just hold the line for me Wilfred. I'll be right back. Thank you.
[16 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Oh tha, thanks.
[18 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Alright, Heather, Wilfred, you still there?
[18 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah.
[18 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So I double checked that with my manager for you as well just because I wanted to give you the best, you know, obviously the information possible, but yes. So anyone you know below the age of 18 will have to be set up as a as a separate cover as well. If you would you like to put, you know all the covers on the same payment date as well. Would is that what you wanted?
[18 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Well, why? Because why? Why am I asking? Because my, my same. I just kept they both working so I can talk to them and get them to take out their own covers.
[18 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : All right.
[18 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Does it make sense?
[18 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[18 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yes. So. So I'll take them. Or if I can't do this, but what I'll do, I'll put my wife in my little one.
[18 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Hmm. Mm.
[18 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Umm, can I put the two of them on the same tablet? He's only four years old. Or three years old?
[19 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK. Not a problem at all. Yeah. So what we'll do is we'll do it for your wife and the little one that you mentioned. Yeah. As a separate. How old is your, the younger one?
[19 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yes, he's only 34.
[19 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Oh, he's turning 4.
[19 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Next year months, yes.
[19 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, so yeah, we don't do children's cover anymore for the funeral cover. So yeah, it would have to be between the ages of 18 to southeast 79 that I mentioned there.
[19 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, so effective. I can only do my wife then.
[19 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Oh, if you wanted to, you can do your other children as well, but that's up to you.
[19 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, but this and this will be separate policies.
[19 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Oh, right, right.
[19 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : So the that's what I'm saying. I I thought the I can so like the old system, I can bundle in one. Everyone is covered.
[19 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Oh, no, I completely understand.
[19 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : I thought something like this. Yes.
[20 minutes][Agent] : Yeah, it's just because, yeah, we don't do to like, uh, children's cover anymore. And anyone over the age of 18, as I mentioned, as I clarified with my manager, would have to, uh, be a separate cover there.
[20 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK, you know, that's good to know.
[20 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK. No worries.
[20 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : So I'll go through my wife here and, you know, and I'll talk to my kitchen to see which way they're gonna go.
[20 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries at all.
[20 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[20 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : All right so Yep. So once again where we left off there for your wife was uh, the $10,000 of cover and that would the premium will be $19.23 per fortnight.

[21 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, all right, So what I can do for you is get your so once again, just for compliance purposes. I'll correct myself on that as well.
