So the last time we spoke to you was on the 21st of April and we ran through a few funeral insurance quotes with you. How'd you manage to go in deciding upon which one you're happy to proceed with?
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : I think I was going to ask, but I think I'll probably go with just the my husband Tony at this stage.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Just a hidden OK, not a problem. 12,000. Sure, give me one SEC. Mm hmm.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah and probably the 12th 12,000 I think yeah, just I was going to ask can I later and myself what would be a separate policy then? I suppose. I suppose that wouldn't Yeah, big deal.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Uh, it wouldn't make a difference to the pricing. Umm, if you do it, if you remember, if you do it as a joint or a single doesn't make a difference to the pricing. It just the premiums are based of your age and the level of cover you choose at the time of application.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. But yeah, sure.
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Uh, so you can, you can take out a cover for yourself as long as you're in this, uh, in Australia and you're so a female Australian resident agency, 18 and 72, yeah, yes.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : But obviously we so just one of us, it's obviously gonna be half the price, the premium as having two.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : And his one, yeah.
[1 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So his one, it'll be installed. His cover is $12,000 for $31.47 per fortnight. Uh, $31.47 per fortnight.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : How much 31 sure. OK, Yeah. And I'd probably want that to start after the 25th of May, please.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : 25th of May. Yeah, I can do that for you. Give me one tick.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sure.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : I'll just go back. I'll go into his profile so I can set it up for you. I'm just currently in your one. Are you both living in the same address, using the same phone number and e-mail? Is that what? OK, give me one tick. I'll just copy it over to his profile.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yeah, that's right, seeing as I've got other, you know, covering things, but he doesn't really have anything.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Right. That's OK.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : So I thought probably makes sense to get something for him at this stage.
[2 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that's right.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So the same phone number I'll put on his profile, OK, your phone number 0411495396 and you have to submit it, use the same e-mail ruth.sandovar@bigpond.com.

[3 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it's ruth.ruth.vandavazandavar@bigpond.com.
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's it. Yeah. I don't remember S saying it was the 21st You sent it, was it?
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's the one we sent it to, uh, 21st, correct?
[4 minutes][Customer] : I'll just go. And I don't remember seeing it, but I have another one.

[5 minutes][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep, yeah, you just do it.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : So if I wanted to get it later, it would be a separate policy.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : You just give us a call, set up your policy.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Uh, you can link it up to the same day using the same bank details. It's not a problem.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So you can just come, it will just come out of the same bank account. But remember, if you're a year older or the, you know, if you're the same age now, then that's fine. You get the same price.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : MMM. Yeah. Mm. Hmm.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So it's like $30 or so for your one, umm, But if you're a year older, you'll just see a slight difference in the pricing for the same level of cover. OK, umm, does that make sense? Does that does that click?
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK OK, so again, I'll just recap on the benefits and the waiting period for his policy.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, sure.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Again, just to make sure you understand everything.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Sure. Mm, hmm.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So remember, you can choose between 3 and $15,000. You get an accidental death benefit and an accidental serious injury benefit as remember if death was due to an accident, the chosen benefit amount will triple from $12,000 to $36,000.
[5 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[5 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : If he was to survive an accident but it became seriously injured, for example quadriplegic or paraplegic.
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : And if this occurred anytime before the policy anniversary following his 75th birthday, then the benefit of that is also tripled. OK.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : For the 1st 12 months you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months, you'll be covered for death due to any cause.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding his policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay his claim in full OK. At any time after he reaches the age of 85, you can choose to end his cover and we'll pay him 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. That is the early cash adoption. And once he reaches the age of 85, his premiums will cease and a 25% bonus cover will automatically be applied to his benefit demand as well. OK. The premiums are level, which means they're designed not to increase as he gets older. You get a free will kit and we also give you a real reward. So after the first year that you that is with us, we return 10% back. So you get $81.82 returned back to his hands as well.
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So you're paying for it, right? So it'll come back to your account, OK.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Uh, keep in mind you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy that the benefit amount. And just please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or an investment moment. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back. OK umm, now just want to confirm any questions before we confirm your details there to set this up. Mm hmm, 12,000 in full. Yeah, 12,000 in full.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK, with the the terminal illness thing did that's paid out you mean TH the 12,000 in full or that's yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. None of that sounds pretty reasonable. Yeah.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. Now you don't need to pay anything today. What we just noted down as a preferred method of payment and a payment date that's suitable for you. As a business, we generally collect your first payment generally within the next 7 days. But is there a day in the next 7 days that's more suitable for you?
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : No, like I said. So you can't.
