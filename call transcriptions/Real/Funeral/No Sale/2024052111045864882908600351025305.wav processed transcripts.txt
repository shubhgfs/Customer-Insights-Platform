[9 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : In the case of accidental death, like let's say death from a car accident or accidental serious injury like quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit amount will triple.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, So if she's insured for, let's say, let's say she's in short for $10,000 for accidental death and accidental serious injury, the benefit amount will triple to $30,000. OK.
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[9 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Now the accidental serious injury, part of it will remain on the policy up until the policy, up until the policy anniversary following the 75th birthday. And then after that it will go off the policy, but the normal funeral insurance will still remain.
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[10 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, All right. Now let me just bring up the level of cover. So for the 1st 12 months, she'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. And after the first 12 months, she'll be covered for death due to any cause.
[10 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[10 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding the policy for 12 months, if she was first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner. We're also going to pay out the claim in four as well. OK, so it covers her not only for death but also 10 minute illness. Now you can choose anywhere between 3 and $15,000 for your auntie. How much?
[10 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : 15?
[11 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[11 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK keep in mind 15,000 is the highest OK level of colour. Now it it's all based on the age you take it out. OK, so $15,000 based on her being 70 years old will work out to be $74.60 per fortnight.
[11 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[11 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK now I want to let you know a few things. This is so WH what that is, is natural death and terminal illness will be 15,000.
[11 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[11 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Accidental death and accidental serious injury as I said will triple and that will triple to $75,000. Sorry what am I saying? It will triple to $45,000.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, so 15,000 * 3 will be 45,000.
[11 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah.
[11 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : This is only payable up until the age of 85 S At the age of 85, the premiums will cease. OK, So once she reaches age 85, the premiums will cease, but the cover will still be in place, OK? And a 25% bonus cover will automatically be applied to the benefit amount.
[12 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : OK. OK.
[12 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So at the age of 85, her policy will be worth $18,750, not 15,000, and there's no further payments, OK?
[12 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK. Thank you.
[12 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Our funeral insurance also provides her with an early cash out option. So at any time after she reaches 85 years of age, she can choose to end the cover and we will pay 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. OK, give me a SEC. Yeah, so sorry. Because you're paying for a you or her. Once she reaches the age of 85, you can choose to end the cover and we will pay you guys 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. Now, the premiums are also level. So the the premiums are level, which means they're designed not to increase as she gets older.
[12 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. Yeah.
[13 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, so it's a level premium. Now you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy.

[13 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a problem. Now I will cover her and then I will e-mail and post you out all the documents so you can actually sit down. You can review it to make sure it's obviously right. And the only thing I need back is the beneficiary form complete and send back. OK, so the beneficiary is who you want to leave the 15,000 to. So will you be the beneficiary? Will that be yourself?
[14 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, do myself.
[14 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : That will be yourself. OK, not a problem. So just give me one SEC. Alright, I'm just going to check some information.

[15 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Give me one moment. OK. Now coming back to the level of cover. So we're doing the 15,000. So natural death and terminal illness will be 15,000, accidental death and accidental serious endure triple to 45,000. That works out to be $74.60 per fortnight. We also refund 10% back after the first year, so there will be a refund of $193.97 back to you after the first year once the policy is in. Once the policy has been held for 12 months, OK, that'll automatically be refunded to you. That's 10% of the first year premiums.
