[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And the address, would that be the same? It is OK. Great. Fantastic, excellent. OK, now I'll take you through the cover in a moment and explain that cover to you and that way you can see how that cover works as well.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and then we could have you find the right level of cover that's obviously suitable as well.
[7 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So basically with our funeral insurance cover today, the way it works is it does provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to your loved ones when you pass away. Umm, they can use the funds not only for funeral expenses, but also for the final expenses like on paid bills. You can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this benefit amounts. Umm, if that is due to an accident, that chosen benefit uh, amount will triple in that case. OK. In addition to that, before the policy anniversary following your mother's 75th birthday, uh, if she was to be, if she was to suffer an accidental serious injuries such as quadriplegic or paraplegia, that benefit now is also tripled as well. It's easy to apply. There are no medical checks. Acceptance is guaranteed if your mother is in a strained resident age between 18 and 79, which are already confirmed for me. So, so just as you know, uh, just to let you know, for the 1st 12 months, umm, she will be, or she, uh, you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months, she'll be covered for death due to any cause.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness for 12 months or less. To leave by a medical practitioner will pay out your claim in full. And that. Yeah. So just that could help with obviously things like medical expenses that point in time I suppose. So you can choose amounts to cover your mother from as low as 3000 up to $15,000. OK. And just a couple of things to note. Your premiums are level, which means they're designed to stay the same as you as you get older, as your mother gets older or when she reaches and when she reaches the age of 85, your premium, her premiums or your premiums sorry will cease. There's no for the premiums you need to pay anymore. Policy remains active and also 25% bonus cover will automate to be applied to death and matters as well. So she's she's also insured for 25% more as well at that point in time as well. OK, so your cover also provides your mother there with an early cash out option. So this means that anytime after she reaches the age of 85 years of age, she can choose to end her cover or pay her 75% of the fee insurance benefit. OK, so that that would be an option there available. So let's go through some pricing together. And as I mentioned, the level of cover ranges from 3000 up to $15,000. Umm, So what benefit? Now would you like to quote you on this?
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just the 15, yeah.
[9 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : First for your mother, the 15,000 OK, that's fine. Now you may pay more in total premiums of the life and policy than the benefit amount. Please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment elements. If you cancel outside of 30 days, the cover will stop and you'll not receive anything back. Just be mindful of that as well.
[10 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK Now if you're considering the 15,000 there the highest level there for your mother, umm, let's have a look what that would look like you'd be paying an amount works out to be exactly OK. Well at the moment it's sitting at $55.47 a fortnight.
[10 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : How much? How much? OK, Yeah, I guess it's alright. Yeah.
[10 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : That does that sound so far, 55 dollars, $55.47 a fortnight every two weeks, that sounding OK All right, so that's $27.74 a week is what you'd be paying, umm, for the $15,000 coverage there for your mother. Another thing we'll do for you too though, Following your mother's first policy anniversary date, we're going to refund you a cash back benefit that happens to be 10% of all the premiums you've been paying during that time as well. So you get 10% back. OK, so that's also there as well. So you're happy with that so far? Perfect. So what this means then for me is that I'm happy to provide your mother the media cover. By doing so, our prices is that we do send out these policy documents out to you so you can sit down. You runtime have a good look through as well. By the way, if I can have you confirm with me, do you have an e-mail address for yourself we put down there for you? What would that be? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, taulika#7@gmail.com.
[11 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. That should arrive usually within 15 minutes to your e-mail. Plus we do post them out to to your postal address that you've given me as well, 15 Nursery Ave. and Runcorn. That is once and we arrive between 2:00 to 5:00 business days with those particular ones. You'll also locate beneficiary forms there as well. Umm, but also we send out a complimentary strain standard legalized wheel kit as well.
[11 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[12 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : You get a free wheel kit, umm, that could that could be used as well if you'd like to uh, for your mother. So, umm, and if you've noticed also that if you have any questions that my name and number will be on those documents for you as well. So you can certainly reach out to myself, ask me some questions if you have any questions. Umm, and this policy also has a 30 day cooling off. Just in case you change your mind. So you don't have to pay anything today. You choose a payment that's suitable for you. Umm, we generally collect the payment. Yeah.
[12 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm, Yeah, would I be able to yeah, to take it out on the 30th of on the Thursday.
