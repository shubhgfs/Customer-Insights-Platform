[4 seconds][Customer] : I'm good, thank you. How are you, Shane?
[6 seconds][Agent] : Good. Good.
[8 seconds][Customer] : And that's good. I've just called Cecilia here. She has a cover for herself and her husband.
[13 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[13 seconds][Customer] : She did have her two daughters on there, but because of their age, it's expired.
[18 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[18 seconds][Customer] : I told her she's not able to add them back on. They're eligible to take out their own cover.
[23 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[23 seconds][Customer] : She wants a quote to set one up for her daughter. She's 23.
[27 seconds][Agent] : No worries.
[27 seconds][Customer] : I can't even do it in a vault here because it's going based off her age and she's 57, so it's not working.
[31 seconds][Agent] : Yep, uh, all good.
[34 seconds][Customer] : Let me jump out, alright? And whenever you're ready. I have done all points of ID for Cecilia, by the way. I don't know if you may need to do it again anyway.
