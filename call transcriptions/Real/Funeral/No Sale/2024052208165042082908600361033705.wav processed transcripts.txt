[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So thanks for that. Perfect. All right, now I'll take you through and explain to you how wool works and then we can look at, you know, what options you've got there and we can obviously customize to suit your specific needs there for your brother. So basically in a nutshell, the way it works there today, Chris, Christopher, sorry, is it provides a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to your loved ones who need them to pass away.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : And it can be used not only for funeral expenses but also for the final expenses like unpaid bills. OK.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Now if death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple. Or if you were to suffer an accidental serious injury before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit member will also be tripled. OK, so there are no medical checks. Acceptance is guaranteed if you are in Australian resident aged between 18 and 79, which you've already confirmed there for Paul. For the first 12 months you will be covered for accidental deaths and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months you'd be covered for death due to any cause. In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we'll pay out your claim in full. Now, the level of cover does range there for your brother Paul between 3000 up to $15,000 that you can select from. Once Paul reaches the age of 85, your premiums will cease and it still remain active, so the policy's still in place and a 25% bonus cover will automatically be applied to the benefit amount as well. So Paul, you'd be insured for 25% more as well. Our funeral insurance cover also provides you with an early cash out option. So this means that any time after you reach the age of 85 years, you can choose to enter cover. We'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. OK, so that's umm for Paul. Umm so good news is the premium, your premiums are level which means they are designed not to increase as you get older or as poor gets older OK? So keep that in mind. And also one more thing, you may pay more in pre so you may PO pay more in total premiums of life and policy than the best amount. Please be aware that this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you're not receiving back. Just be mindful of that as well, OK.
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Well, well, I think when I was looking like a funeral plan, I think when I've done me Farber two years ago, it was 8000.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So what benefit now would you like to quote you on there for Paul between 3000 to 15,000, that's the range, yes, yes, OK.
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : So that's a cremation. Like I'm not worried about bearable cremation. So I'm just trying to work out what it actually be. Well, I'm hoping like you know, they said he's got terminal illness, but it's undisclosed what how long he's got because I just said he's got a tumor. So it could be two years. But I'm just thinking what people we plan to be working 2 years and it's if it's about 8 grand now, would it go up in two years? You can't be paid.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : It's not something yes, it's it's not, it's one of those questions that we really don't, you know, can can really advise, you know.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : So I I've just claimed to pay 6000 when I married you and then when he died, it was 8000. And now to cover currently covered 6000. So to pay at 2000. So what would it be looking?
[8 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : But you but also R.E.M. also remember this too. Just to help you out with your sort of thoughts there. This is paid as a cash benefit, right?
[8 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So you can use those funds. So even if the like say you got more funds, right, you can use those funds for all sorts of purposes, whether it be, you know, the cremation with other fees, whatever it may be, you know, I mean, so so think of it that way too. OK, right, sure. What?
[9 minutes][Customer] : If I say if I went for 10 just to be the safe side, you know, just in case I have funds then or anybody else has more funds, I want to make sure that you're covered.
[9 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Right, sure.
[9 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's. Yeah, that's good.
[9 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : If he did that then you'd be paying an amount of $22.89 a fortnight for Paul that is happy with that.
[9 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Well, if I go to 10, at least I did that.
[9 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : As I said, I'm hoping like, you know, you still have another two years and then if it goes up in that time, I should still be under the amounts then what our promotions were. So I'd rather be probably more over than under.
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, fair enough.
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : So if I'm.
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So you're happy with that 10,000 so far, the $22.89 a fortnight? Yeah, through also you may not know this and if you basically the, there's a feature part of the insurance known as the real, the real reward that is attached to the policy as well. So that means that following your first policy anniversary that we're going to refund you 10% of the premiums paid during that time as well.
[9 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, So it's also part of OK, so, so you probably know that as well. All right, that's fine. So what I'll do now is that we'll provide Paul with immediate cover. We send out these policy documents out to you. So you'll get 2 copies.
[10 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : I've already got one with you guys and myself, like yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : As you know, a soft copy will go to your e-mail and plus hard cops will get posted to the postal address you gave me as well to get those two copies. That will give you an opportunity to obviously review it yourself, make sure you're happy with it. So, and if you've got any questions, my name and number beyond those documents.
[10 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[10 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : This policy also has a 30 day calling off. Just in case you change your mind. So you don't actually have to pay anything today. You choose a payment that's suitable for you. We generally collect payments within the next 7 days. When would the next seven days would be more suitable for you?
[10 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Well, my payment, my payment will be fortnight because I'm in government, so my pay is next Thursday.
[11 minutes][Agent] : All right, so if you want me to line up on that payday, I can schedule that for you. Let me just look at the calendar here.
[11 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Can I ask one thing before? Can I ask one thing before whatever now say for instance, yeah, I pay out for 12 months. Now say that he does pass away before the 12 months I lose whatever I've paid out. Yeah.
[11 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yes, of course, if he was to pass away, depending on the situation, if it was to do with accidents, it was accidental death. For example, we, we are even though within the within the first, the first 12 months we are paying out triple the amount to you.
[11 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah. A, as I said, like you already know that he's got a terminal tumour. But I'm saying if I pay the annual plan out and he dies within the 12 months, every anything I've paid out I don't get back to it.
[11 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Alright, Yeah, correct. So remember there there is that feature as I mentioned to you for the 1st 12 months you're covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months you're covered for death due to any 'cause. That's right.
[12 minutes][Customer] : At the end, at the end of the day, like if it does pass away before the 12 months, but I'm not going to be worried what I've paid out. But yeah, I'm just just just crazing that.
[12 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yes, yeah, no, that's fine. Just just because you're you're generalizing to Christopher.
[12 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So as I mentioned to you, because in the 1st 12 months you are still Co he is still covered but for accidental death and accidental serious injury only, OK. So in the scenario that he passes away due to an illness as as you're suggesting there in the 1st 12 months he's not covered. That is correct. In, in, in you saying that? OK.
[12 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, that's all. But I've still got any.
[12 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, yeah, that's fine.
