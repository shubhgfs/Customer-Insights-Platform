[2 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I that's what I told my husband. It should it shouldn't it shouldn't have a problem, but then I because I got paid on the 11th and if policy on the 12th right the the money should go in on the 12th.

[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Let me see.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : That's, that's what I'm saying. You can cancel the policy, but if you're asking if you're gonna receive a refund from that cancellation, no.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : If I cancel I lose everything but there's no other. There's no other policy that I can join, is there?
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so you'll be 18 next year. And I mean when you say another policy can join, what do you mean? MMM, yeah.
