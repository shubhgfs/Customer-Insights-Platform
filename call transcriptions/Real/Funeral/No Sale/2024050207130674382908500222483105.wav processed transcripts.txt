[21 seconds][Agent] : Hi Wilfred, my name is Jane and I'm calling from the customer support team at Real Insurance. How are you today?
[27 seconds][Customer] : I'm good. Thanks.
[28 seconds][Agent] : That's good. Just before we proceed, Please note all our calls are recorded. Any advice we provide is general in nature, may not be suitable to your situation. And just for security and privacy, if I can get you to confirm for me your full name, date of birth and e-mail address on file.
[45 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it's Williams.
[55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And just the e-mail address there for me that we have on file for you buffer.
[50 seconds][Customer] : Yes, she works with williams@hotmail.com.
[1 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And I've got you on the right mobile 0422813341. Alright, so I've got a request here to give you a call back in relation to your policy and also on extra cover. Is that correct?
[1 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yes, possibility. So what, because I haven't I, I would only review the policy.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Oh, yeah.
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : So what's the policy about, Uh.
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's start with what you're covered for and then you can let me know if you want to do anything further. So at the moment you've got a final expenses insurance. Let me just look that up for you. Alright, So what I'll do is I'll cover off what's included in your policy.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Umm alright, so I've got here that your final expenses insurance provide your family members with a cash benefit of 14,000 and 71 in the event that you pass away. It can be used not only for funeral expenses but also any other final expenses like unpaid bills. If death was due to an accident, the benefit amount is tripled. Now UMM included in your cover is a cash out benefit, which means once the oldest person covered under the policy turns 85, you have the option to cancel your policy and receive a cash out benefit of 50% of the funeral insurance benefit amount for One life insured. You also have a sum insured bonus. So once the oldest person covered under the policy turns 90, premiums are no longer payable and you will also receive a 25% sum insured bonus on the funeral insurance benefit amount at no additional cost to you. And so from the age of 90, if you opt to cancel your cover and receive the cash out benefit, it will be 50% of your increased funeral insurance benefit amount for one life insured. OK, so that's basically what's covered under the policy that you've got, but you also have, uh, Cherise Williams, Cody Williams and Tegan Williams under this policy as well.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yes, so I I, I if I want to get my because that's my ex-wife.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yep.

[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, so you want to leave Charisse on here, but you want to do another one with your new wife and step kids.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, so with that one, because this policy is umm, no longer, so we no longer offer this one. So if you were to look at extra cover, one aged you have alright, so 48. So what I can do is I can transfer you through to the you will need to take out a cover for you and your wife. And did you say 2 stepchildren?
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, So what does it mean with my existing cover or what I've got?
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So this one you'll keep because you've got your kids and and then on this one, because it's a dry and family one. Umm, but for the extra cover, umm, for your wife, you can't add them on to this one, but you can take out a top one on top.
