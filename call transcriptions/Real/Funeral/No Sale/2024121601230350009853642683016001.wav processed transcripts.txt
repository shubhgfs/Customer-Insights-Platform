[3 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : M for Mary, Thank you so much, beautiful. And just so I can help you out the best I can and get a better understanding from you. Also, what's prompted you to give us a call to start looking at some funeral insurance on behalf of your dad?
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Because, uh, for me, I was thinking, because uh, uh, last I remember last year, uh, he stopped talking about, but he wasn't say that before.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : He just said last year on Christmas, he said that, uh, I wanna, uh, he, he, he wants us to take him to some more and parry there. And I was in, Oh, Oh well, but I wasn't saying because, uh, I thought he's living in Australia. He has to be Parry.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Oh wow, Yeah.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : But you know, last Christmas when you have a Christmas family Christmas together and then he mentioned, he said, oh, please, I wanna go. You know, I want you guys to take me to some more entire e-mail. I said, Oh, well, but I was thinking, oh, that's odd. You know, for us, we have children, we have a lot of things and taking to some more. It's a lot of expensive thing, you know what I mean? Oh, oh, it's expensive to take him there. So that's what I'm, I'm studying. I said to manage, you know, better start around and uh, maybe, you know, make a, the final plan insurance for him. So maybe it will help us, you know, we have kids, so.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Oh, wow, yeah, yeah, that's that's not fair enough. Because I understand you're trying to honour your dad's wishes at the same time.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I know it's not the.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So wanting to be buried in Samoa, Yeah, there you go.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Well, hopefully this will help out because what the funeral insurance does, we get you to choose cover from $3000 up to $15,000. What if you end up choosing for your dad? That's the amount that you're going le let's say you're listed down as a beneficiary for your dad's funeral insurance. That's the amount that you would receive. So then that that money, it can be put on his burial.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : You know, the flights involved of of course carries have his bodies and over to some more as well.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Oh, wow, yeah.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : I don't know how much that would cost, but you know, we'll run through various pricing to see what's going to suit you as well.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Is that the only, is that the only amount? So I can entice that too.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Uh, from $3000 up to $15,000 is is umm, for funeral insurance.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : That's connected, man. Oh, really? No. More like 15. MMM.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : That's the maximum that we can look at $15,000 yeah, yeah, more than no more than $15,000 because usually the I understand your situation is different, right?
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : But like, for example, getting like buried here in Astro, Australia, according to the government's Money Smart website, private funerals typically like $4000, that's for a basic cremation and then it costs up to $15,000 for a more detailed burial service. So understanding in your situation is different.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Uh, yeah, I know, huh.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Hopefully $15,000 might be a bit of a help for you to, of course, have you know your dad's wishes. Yeah. Do you want me to work for $15,000? If you're looking at the maximum amount of cover there for your dad, sure.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Uh, please, Umm, uh, one question.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Yeah, sure.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : If, if, umm, I, I, you need to understand my point before we go there because my point, I was thinking, I talked to my husband and I said, oh, what about we need to sit, uh, everywhere to find something. Will, umm, suit him? Uh, whatever insurance that they can, you know, like if my father passed away. So what's the first thing I have to do? Can you, umm, can you, can I give you the, the, the what is called the test certificate? And then you put the money in my bank And then how long it take? Is it because we're taking a person to sell more? I, I don't know about it. I never experienced because I haven't been, Yeah.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK, I'll be there to answer your questions. Like with a death certificate, it's not required because death certificates can take weeks and weeks, even months to come through. So rather than provide the ticket, we just need a proof of death signed by a medical practitioner. I'm just signing off that your dad has passed away. Once we've got the supported and completed documents from you, generally the funds are released within one business day. So it's not designed to be, umm, you know, a hard process.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, OK, OK what?
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : However, because funeral costs, one passes away like it, the costs come up quite quickly. So that's why we say that when we've got the completed and supported documents, generally it's released within one business day. The funds.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I see. That's good. That's pretty good. Sounds good to me because I haven't being expensive those things.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : That's good, yeah.
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Maybe I was thinking because I think, oh, this is what I want.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : That's right. Yeah.
[8 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : I have to pay this for my father once he pass away and then I need the money quickly in my account so I can organize things, you know, like taking to somewhere basically the, the flight and uh, it's headache, but I have to FedEx. But what can you do? You have a father. Excuse me.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : He's he's want these wishes.
[8 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : It's it's yeah, my heart is, uh, it's, it's still different. Last Christmas when my father because I'm oldest, you know, of the, the kids when they bring up.
[8 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : And I was thinking, Oh my goodness, why didn't you say that? It's a long time. And now you said, oh, please, I like to call bury in summer. I said, oh, what can you do?
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, he wants that.
[9 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : No matter how hard you have to do it because it's delicious that he wanted, you know, it sounds good. Can can we go ahead with that 15? It's no more than 15. So go ahead with it.
[9 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Because I was thinking, I never think the 15.
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : I was thinking my husband said, oh, if you can do the 20 or 30, we can do that. Just go ahead.
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I see.
[9 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : But now I don't know how much, you know, it's more I don't know.
[9 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, I know that. Uh, yeah.
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : It's, I don't know, ****.
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I'll let you know the terms and conditions anyway, and I'll run through some pricing based on that $15,000.
[9 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah.
[9 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Just so you know, your dad does not need to go come on the phone and like you can apply for this on his behalf. That's not an issue.
[9 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[9 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : As long as you're authorized to purchase the policy on his behalf, that's fine.
[9 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[10 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Just so you know, it's guaranteed acceptance.
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So for the 1st 12 months of the policy, your dad will be covered for accidental death only after the first 12 months. It covers introductory to any cause.
[10 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : No.
[10 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Now in addition, there is a living benefit and it's called a terminal illness benefit, which means that after holding the policy for 12 months, if your dad was first diagnosed with the terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, he claimed the funds early if it's required. So if he's got any medical bills, for example, the $15,000 can be reclaimed earlier while still alive. Otherwise you just wait, wait until he passes away to claim the funds. So there is that terminal illness benefit now also give you a Peace of Mind as well that the premiums are designed to stay the same. So the what I quote today, the premiums are not designed to go up as he gets older. You can also find information about our premium structure and that's on our website too.
[10 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh, Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh.
[11 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Now, when your dad turns 85, you don't have to pay any more of his cover, but he's still covered beyond the the age of 85 as well. So you've got free of cover at that point. What we also do to give you another piece of mind is we increase the benefit amount by including a 25% bonus cover. When he turns 85, that $15,000 will automatically increase to $18,750. So we. Yeah, So we automatically, hopefully Touchwood, he will live to that age. You know, the there is that bonus cover.
[11 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : I think my dad will be, he said. He said I'm going to raise my hundreds. I said yeah, I hope so.
[11 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So only seven years away, 100.
[11 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Say everything, father.
[11 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, That's a good age. That's the spirit.
[11 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : He always restarted going hundreds years.
[11 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. There you go.
[11 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : So I said yeah, why not? As long as you stay healthy.
[11 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : That's it.
[11 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. That's that's understand. Mm hmm.
[12 minutes][Agent] : Hey, that's the 100 would be a good age, that's for sure. So you can reach that now you'll cover, that's it. You cover. Also provide you with the early cash out options. So anytime after your dad turns 85, he can choose to end the cover if he wishes to and we will pay 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. Do you have any questions or what I've gone through? Is that sounding straightforward so far? Oh, yeah?
[12 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : It's missing what says that if you know insurance, but it's it's not in Australia, but I have to take to some more, you know what I mean?
[12 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : What were your mum's wishes? The same like your mum. Oh, she doesn't. Is your mum still here?
[12 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : He's not with Mum.
[12 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Oh, he's not.
[12 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : They are divorced. Long time.
[12 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, gotcha.
[12 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[12 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Fair enough.
[12 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : And Mum? Yeah. Mum already passed away. So only him.
[12 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[12 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[12 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : And so her wishes were completely different. Was she buried here in Australia? Your mom?
[13 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : In some way as well. My mum, yeah.
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Oh, in Samoa. OK. I see. Yeah.
[13 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, when she when, when, when mom visit other kids in some more and she died. Did that easy. And then we all travel and then bury it there. But this old man, I don't know if he can visit and die there or you die, you know, and then they have to take it.
[13 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK, fair enough.
[13 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's why.
[13 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : I'll go through some pricing for you. So $15,000 funeral cover, it's $166.42 a fortnight. So you're roughly looking at would be just a bit over $83 per week to get your dad covered for $15,000 for his funeral.
[13 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's alright.
[13 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Is that sounding affordable there to you? Does that sound suitable?
[13 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's great. Yeah.
[13 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : That's good.
[13 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : What can I do as I did though? Yeah.

[14 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : I have to be there for him.

[30 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : There's one question still coming up in my mind.
[30 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yes, yeah.
[30 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : I was thinking also, you know, some sometimes you know the different story from the beginning, but at the end it's different story as well. I was thinking about taking my father. Is it possible to the insurance through? Because I was thinking of maybe only in Australia. They allowed only in Australia, not allowed in office, you know what I mean?
[30 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Oh, well, that's up to you. Whatever you do with that money, that's completely up to you.
[30 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, but as long as as long as I say, yeah, as long as insurance will be, you know, like when something happened with my father so they can put straight away in my account and then I will, you know what I mean?
[30 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So we don't have any say on how this one, it gets paid in a bank account. That's right. So when we've got the supported and completed documents and that claim is being paid, it just gets paid into a bank account. That's right.
[31 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. That's all. And thank you for your time.
[31 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yes, it's alright. Thank you for yours. Well, all the best if I don't speak to you.
