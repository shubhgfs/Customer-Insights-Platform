[4 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK, I cancel OC Yep.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK. You also, oh sorry, you'd have to put Stevens full name, date of birth, policy number and then you have to pop in your full name, your date of birth and your address.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Once we receive that, our admin department will be able to process that as per the PDS and they'll send you a confirmation of cancellation within seven business days to confirm it has been cancelled.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Mm Hmm.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Now, do you mind me asking, will you be sending it from the e-mail address that we have on file?
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, excellent. If you do happen to send it from a different e-mail address, we would require either electronic signature or that I would signature end date. Now, do you mind me asking though, Lorraine, because you both had it going for quite some time. You're insured for $8000 each and it is covering you both for your death due any cause worldwide 24/7 with that multiplier. So if death is due to an accident, that benefit amount is doubled with an additional 5000 on top. Any particular reason that we weren't happy with it?
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : We're just retired and we just it's 8080 something dollars a a month that we just haven't won't have in our pension to pay for it. So we we don't have life policies at the moment. So, you know, if anything happens to us, so the life policies will just kick in. And, and, and we took this out at a time when we'd actually got together and bought our own house. And at that stage we really didn't have the money to, if anything happened to either of us to cover the, the policy. So it was suggested we take it out.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : So it's not, it's not valid now in, in that respect. So that's why we can't sleep.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK. Well, look, send through the, the, the e-mail, the letter as soon as you can. Only reason I say as soon as you can is because Please note, until the policy is cancelled, payments will continue as normal. Undercover will remain in place. There is a payment scheduled to come out tomorrow. Would you mention there that you know you're, you're can't afford it at the moment? Would that be an issue if that payment came out? That's fine.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : No, TH TH the payment can come out tomorrow, that's fine. So can we cancel it as of so we'll just keep it to for the next month.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So can we cancel it as on so just keep it for the next month?
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So because of as of what date?
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Look, so just if you send through the letter as soon as you can, it'll it'll just they'll action it for you and it just you'll have if the payment comes out tomorrow, you'd have coverage up until the 20th of July 2023. But if the payment comes down the 21st of July, you'd have coverage up until the 20th of August 2023.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So even that payment does come out tomorrow and we do receive your letter tomorrow and that payment has come out. They they would either refund it or if we've received that e-mail in time or that you'd have coverage up until the next regular, but you'd get an e-mail just to confirm or, or a letter to confirm everything.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : OK, that's fine. Alright.
[7 minutes][Agent] : Alright, my name is Regina. Regina.
[7 minutes][Customer] : And who am I talking to, Regina?
