[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, all right, no problem. OK, just give me a second.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : No worries.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : System is attached. So what I'll do is because you already have the car with us, but I'll just give you a refresher here uh, just so because it may have been a for a while there. So the archive is designed to provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to your loved ones with new pass away. They can use the funds not only for funeral expenses but any other final expenses like on pay bills, mortgages or to maintain their lifestyles. You can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this benefit amount and if that is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple. In addition, before the policy anniversary following a 75th birthday, if you were to suffer an accidental serious injuries such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit amount will also triple. As you know, it's easy to apply, there are no medical checks and acceptance is guaranteed if you are Australian. If you are, if you are an Australian resident aged between 8979. Now just so you know, for the 1st 12 months you'll be covered for death for for accidental death and accidental serious injury.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Only after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause. In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you are first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less biomedical practitioner, we will pay your claim in full to help you with things like medical expenses. So how is that sounding for you so far? Is that, is that kind of bringing back from the time that you had the insurance? Is it the same?
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, Yes, it is. Yeah.
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. Now, uh, you can choose car from any from anywhere from $3000 up to $15,000. And there's a couple of things that you need to know that your premiums are level, which means they are designed to stay the same as you get older and when you reach the age of 85, your premiums will cease without nothing more to pay and you'll also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover. This will be applied to your benefit amount and with the cover as well. I have to mention too that you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. Please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment elements. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your car will stop and you will not receive anything back unless you're eligible for and choose the early cash back offer because I'm not too sure, but do you remember that also now covers we have what is called an early cash out option. So at any time after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose to and end your cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. Now, uh, what level of cover were you looking at getting for Wendy?
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : The one that we got, I guess like basic cover, just the funeral sort of, you know.
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Uh, the one that we bought quite basic cover, just the, uh, you know, sort of, you know, yeah. Was it, uh, was it cover for like anywhere between, uh, 3000 to $15,000? You can choose for her. Uh yeah. I think our benefit was uh large.
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : 2253 thousand 250, yeah, I think our benefit was life insurance benefit was like 18,000 or something like that.
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : The insurance benefit was like 18,000 or something like that. So OK, but well, uh, the because the maximum you can go with the funeral cover for uh fall, uh Wendy is a $15,000. So would you like me to choose that one for you? Yes.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, something like that, yeah. Yeah, that'd be fine. Yep. 4/9.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what you're looking at paying for when the, uh, for $15,000 fortnightly works out to be $16.22 a fortnight and uh yes and also uh, also because you are a real uh member uh, that uh, one second. I just tell that there's a there's a discount as well. We have a real reward attached to the policy. Following your first policy anniversary date, we will refund you 10% of the premiums you have paid in that time. We will send you a free will kit valued at $30.00 with each policy. So your real reward after the anniversary would be $42.18 as well after the 1st anniversary date. But, uh, but what you're looking at paying for her would be work out to be $16.22 a fortnight. So, uh, do you think that would be, uh, enough of cover there for Wendy?
[8 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, just just mainly for the funeral. I'll just. I'll be alright, I think.
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Uh, yeah. And I mean, and, and she's suffered an accidental serious injury. Then the benefit amount will triple, which will be $45,000.
[8 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That'll be a good start, yeah.
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, so umm, just check something here as well. So, umm, 31 Calloway Dache Vistan Australia 6065 is that they have when he lives with you as well. And that's your postal address as well. OK, no worries. And, uh, as a business as well, they are, they normally collect, generally collect payments within the next 7 days.
[9 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, next Wednesday. Is that alright? Could I pay you now or start the policy?
[9 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Uh, so when in the next 7 days, I will be more suitable for you, uh, to make the first fortnight, the premium, uh, the policy can be up and running as of today. Umm, uh, you want, uh, and, uh, when did you want the first payment to come out? You wanted the first time to come out today.
