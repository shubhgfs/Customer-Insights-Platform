Accidental serious injury cover for each life insured under age 75 starts immediately and ends on a policy anniversary following the life insured 75th birthday. Once a life insured reaches age 85, you can choose to voluntarily cancel that person's cover to receive a lump sum payment of 75% of the chosen benefit amount.
