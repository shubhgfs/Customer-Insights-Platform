Any advice I provide is general with nature, may not be suitable to your situation now just so I can help you the best I can as well and get a better understanding from you. Do you currently have any cover for your funeral at the moment or is this something new for you?
[53 seconds][Customer] : No, this is something new.
[54 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. Just to explain the cover, so you would have seen when applying for our website that you can choose to cover from $3000 up to $15,000. Whatever you end up choosing, that's the amount that your family receive and they, we pay that as a cash benefit and they use those funds to pay for your final wishes.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep, right.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Ha, Have you thought about as well like what you're wanting in terms of your, in terms of your funeral, whether you're wanting to be cremated or have a burial or something else, for example?
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No, still still deciding. Possibly chromated, but yeah, still still deciding at this stage.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Fair enough. Yeah, no worries at all. Even if you're still deciding on what the type of funeral you're wanting to have, you can still purchase funeral insurance as well. So we just get you to choose the amount, umm, you wish to require or your family to receive and that's the amount they've received upon your passing. Now I see that you've also, uh, looked at, uh, you're wanting to cover, uh, someone else's. Will you select to join?
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes, I just, it was a bit confusing as to how that worked. So was it 15,000 for both or was it 15,000 each?
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : You can choose you, you can choose to have a both or each. It's it's entirely up to you E each person you can choose to have them cover from 3000 up to $15,000.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Right. OK, well, I don't know going on from what I can gather with prices, it's probably, you're probably looking at 15 each. Yep.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : The idea for you was it to have $15,000 each or as a combined Yeah, no worries. I'll quote on 15,000 each. Then I'll. Who was the second person that you're wishing to insure? Yeah. And what's your wife's first name? Thank you. Same surname or different surname?
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : My wife, Leslie Lesley, No, same surname.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. I assume husband and wife, of course. And lastly, Leslie's date of birth, please.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yep. 7th of September 1954.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Leslie is also an Australian residence.
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yes, she is.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yep, thank you. Now it's easier to get umm, both of you covered. It's guaranteed acceptance. So meaning that there's no medicals that you're required to pick or no forms to be filled in either. Just so you know, for the 1st 12 months of the cover, you and Leslie will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. After the first 12 months of the cover you're both covered for death due to any 'cause now.
[3 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Right, right, right.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a living benefit. It's called a terminal illness benefit, which means that after holding the policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness for 12 months and still live by a medical practitioner, what you're being insured for gets paid out to you whilst you're still alive.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So if you've got any medical expenses or you simply want to leave the funds behind to the family, that's entirely up to you how those funds have been used.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Now when you're in Leslie turn 85 as well. So we no longer charge you anymore of your premiums, but you're still covered beyond the age of 85 as well, even though you're not required to pay anymore.
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Right. Yep.
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : What we also do is include a 25 bonus cover. So we increase that $15,000 automatically to $18,750 per person.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Otherwise, there's a benefit called an early cash out option. So at any time after you endlessly turn 85, you could choose to end your cover. We'll pay you 75% of your funeral insurance benefit.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Do you have any questions so far or is that sounding straightforward there for you, Wayne?
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. No, it sounds OK.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. Now with premiums, they're designed to stay the same. So they're not designed to go up as you unless they get older. Uh, you can also find information about our premium structure and that's available on our website too. But let's go through some pricing there for you. So I'm gonna quote on the both of you together to start off with. So each fortnight it's $161.14. That's to be covered for our maximum $15,000. Now we should put the cover to $45,000 in the event of an accident to get as well. But starting with that $15,000 funeral cover there. How does that sound? Is that sounding suitable? Did you want me to explore other options and look at going lower than the 15,000?
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Right, OK, right, right, yeah.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yes, of course.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : What about what about if we try about 8:00 or 10 maybe maybe yeah or 10 maybe start maybe do 10.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So 8000, yeah, Yep, sure. And then we can, yeah, we can look at 8 as well for the both of you.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep, right.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So $10,000, that's going to deepen the cover down to $107.42 a fortnight, $8000.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : So that's sorry.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah. Oh, no, you're also the premiums are together, but it's $10,000 each.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : So that's so that, so that's each or Yeah. OK. Yep.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : That's right, yeah. And then $8000 cover would then drop it down again. Let's have a look to see what will be. So it's $85.94 a fortnight if you drop $8000.
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : And that's 8. And so that's 8000 each. Yep. OK.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 8000 H that's right.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : All right. Yep.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Wherever you decide to start as well, like if you start lower to far or you know, wherever you decide, you can apply to INCREA or take out more cover or decrease it subject to your eligibility at the time as well.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So you want to start with something just to have something there, that security there for your funeral. Was there a level of cover that stood out to you though between those 3?
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Probably we could probably go look at the 10, probably 10 each.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, an age, yeah, of course. So if you want to start there just to have that security there for your funeral wine, the next step is to get you and Leslie cover covered. So what the process for that is, we issue all the policy documents via post to the both of you and send out an e-mail.
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : There's a form we get you to fill out. It's called a beneficiaries form because the idea to nominate each other down as each other's beneficiaries. Or do you, Leslie, have children together you're wishing to nominate?
[7 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : We do have children, but it I suppose it depends if it's, well, I mean, if one of us is still here, well, then they would be the beneficiary. But yeah, I mean, if we after we're after, yeah.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, that's fair enough.
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : I mean at at some stage if the children would be brought into it, I would think yeah, yeah. Yep.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Well, you can nominate up to five beneficiaries anyway there. Umm, Wayne.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So what we get you to fill that form out, sign it, and then send that back through.
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Now, even though we get you and Leslie protected on that $10,000 from today, we just get you to choose exactly when you'd like to start with your first payment as well.
[7 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Are you happy to continue?
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yes. But yeah, so, so and so we've got to basically wait for the paperwork to come out and fill that out and then we sort of nominate a date for it to start from.
[8 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Or you could start like for, for example, we issue the umm, so generally released within umm, three to five working days. We get you to choose when you want to start with your first payment from today. All we ask from you is you just fill out the beneficiary form sign and send it back through. But everything else we do for you today. So in terms of payment, umm there you're not required to fill out a form of banking details or anything like that.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Right.
