[53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, don't know. Everyone jumped with me. Ex missus petite can't do nothing about it.
[58 seconds][Agent] : OK, so at the moment, uh, just wanna clarify, would it be safe for me to assume that you're looking at cover just to have that Peace of Mind that when you pass your family or your beneficiary would that doesn't have anything to worry about?
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Is that your main confirmed?
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's fine. Not a problem. Well, I'll be happy to help you with this is actually very simple and easy to do over the phone here at real Insurance. I'll run to the cover with you first, explain the benefits and pricing and then, uh, you can let me know if that suits your situation, your budget. Are you working currently as well?
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No, no, it wasn't disability painted.
[1 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Disability attention. OK, not all that's all fine, that's fine as well, but not a problem. Basically to apply for funeral insurance, you don't need to be working as long as uh, you're an Australian resident age between 40 and 79, acceptance is guaranteed for you.
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, a few things just to note is that it is a worldwide cover. So if you do a bit of traveling, it covers you overseas or 24 hours 7 days worldwide. It's also flexible for you. So if the situation changes, you can always give us a ring and apply to reduce the policy or if you ever wanting additional cover, you can apply for a separate top up policy as well subject to eligibility, OK? And you can do that as long as the total that you have with us does not exceed above $15,000 in total. OK. Now our cover is designed to provide a cash benefit that's paid to your nominated beneficiary when you pass away. So they can use that at the time to pay off the funeral expenses if there's money leftover. Obviously I could use it for other things as well, like unpaid bills or debts as well. OK Uh, when you begin the policy, there's just waiting periods. I just want you to understand this. So when you start to cover for the 1st 12 months, you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only, Robert.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : And then after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause, OK. In addition, Sir, you also get a terminal illness benefit on this policy, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we will pay your claim in full to help with things like medical expenses. Your The beauty about our policy is that your premiums that you pay us are designed to stay the same as you're getting older.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So if you are on a DSB, uh, or a pension, you have the Peace of Mind. Your premiums are desired to stay the same as you get older. And when you turn 85, your premiums will stop. So you don't need to continue paying the premium.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Your cover will still be active for your thereafter, OK, at the age of 85, you will also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover as all of it.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So if you do pass away after the age of 85, your beneficiaries will receive your chosen benefit amount and the extra 25% bonus cover as well to cover off, you know, any unexpected expenses that they may have by that time.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yeah.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, uh, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website and your cover also provides you with an early cash out option. Now this option you don't need to use if you don't want to, but once you reach that age of 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. OK, now let's look at some options with you now together and see what what level of cover you feel comfortable with. The range that you can choose the funeral insurance for ranges between $3000 up to $15,000. What benefit a man would you like to look at first? OK, 50 is the highest level, so 15,000. This one you compare again fortnightly, monthly or annually. It still works exactly the same price whichever way you wanna do it. It's set up as a direct debit fortnightly shop. So fortnightly on the 15,000, Rob, that one is $55.47 a fortnight.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep, we'll get out of 15, but but nothing but yeah, yeah, he just like my son's junior because he's my organization of everything.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, if you ho Yeah, sorry.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Then you're selling what's going on.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : But here he is now and my day going.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Hi there. My name is AJ. So I'm one of the funeral insurance agents here in real insurance just so I can assist you. Uh, just can I get to confirm your first name, please?
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : I'm Anthony.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : And you're Robert's son of that life.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, thank you. Not a problem. I just take up just, uh, sorry, please. All calls recorded. Any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. So I've just taken Robert threw up, uh, cover and showing him a quick quote there on the prices. What I'll do is I'll take you through the cover as well. Are you the one paying for his insurance or is he gonna be paying for it himself?
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : It'd be time for himself. Yeah. Mm, Hmm.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. I'll just get, I'll just cover off what I'm to explain to him so you understand how the cover works. And if you want to ask me any questions, just I'll be happy to help you as well. It's not a problem. OK.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Uh, so basically here in real insurance, you know, the funeral insurance, what it's designed to do is to provide a cash benefit that's paid to Robert's beneficiary. So if you're his beneficiary, but at the time of his passing, you can simply call us claiming his policy and use that money to cover his funeral expenses. OK. Uh, we don't require, you know, a death certificate when you know, when you just that claim, we just did a confirmation either from the hospital or the medical practice and upon receiving all claims documents, we generally pay that claim within one business day to you for your, his beneficiary, so they can use that money as soon as possible to get that funeral started. OK, uh, to apply for the cover, there's no medical checks, no blood tests. Basically, as long as he's an Australian resident aged between 40 and 79, acceptance is guaranteed. OK. Uh, the policy does protect him 24 hours, 7 days worldwide. So if he does a better traveling overseas, he's still protected. It's also flexible as well. So if this situation ever changes in the future, you can always apply to reduce the policy. Or if he's about wanting additional cover in the future, he can apply for a separate top up policy as well, subject to eligibility. And he can do that as long as the total that he has with us does not exceed above $15,000 in total. OK.
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : And he mentioned he's got a pension, a DSP, a disability support pension. So we do wanna make sure that at the end of the the cover suits him and the prices are manageable for him. The premiums are designed, you know, to stay the same once it's active. So the premium's designed to stay the same as he gets older. And then once he turns 85, his premium stops. So he doesn't need to continue paying the premium after he turns 85, but his cover will still be active for him thereafter. OK.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. No worries.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : At the age of 85, we also automatically add on for him a 25% bonus cover as well. So if he does pass away after 85, then his beneficiary will receive the chosen benefit demand and the extra 25% bonus cover to cover off any unexpected expenses that that they may have at that time. OK. There's also an early cash and option on the policy. Now this one he doesn't need to use if he doesn't want to. But once he reaches that age of 85 years of age, he can choose to end his cover and we will pay him 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. OK. Do you have any questions on the benefits first so far? Firstly Anthony.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, that's alright. That's alright. Yeah.
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now importantly there are waiting periods on funeral cover. So once he starts to cover, keep in mind for the 1st 12 months he will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only and then after the first 12 months he will be covered for death due to any cause.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So just a question there.
[8 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah.
[8 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : He has been covered previously with you guys.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Uh, I'll mention that he has no authority on that profile anymore. I think the main insured has taken him off, so he doesn't have an insurance anymore on that policy.
[8 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So because he's already been covered, does he have to still do that 12 months?
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because he's starting a new policy, the 12 month waiting for it to will apply on the new policy basically. Yeah. OK.
[8 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Now, in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit on the policy, which means after holding his policy for 12 months, if he was first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we will pay out the claim directly to him in full.
[8 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Alright, no worries. Thank you.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, now, umm, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website, but I'll show you a bit of a pricing, uh, option for you on this. Umm, the, the, the level of cover you can choose ranges from $3000 up to $15,000. He did ask for record on the 15 which I gave him just then before you jumped on, which came to about $55.47 a fortnight. That policy comes with a free online legal will about at $160.00. If you have another will that will provide one for him and we also give him a cash back as well. So basically after the first policy anniversary date, we refund him 10% of the total premiums. He's paying the time back to his hands. So he gets back $144.23 as well, which is that cash back to him.
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, no worries.
[9 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, Uh, how do you find that option for him? Do you wanna look at any other options or do you feel like 15,000 is suitable for him?
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that'll be suitable. That'll be fine.
[9 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, I would need to speak to him to finalize this. Uh, so if you can pop him back on, I'll be happy to take him to the rest there and get that in place.
[9 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : No worries. Yeah, thank you very much.
[9 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Thank you, Anthony.
