[2 seconds][Agent] : Hello and welcome to Real Insurance. You're speaking with Cameron. How may I help you today?
[6 seconds][Customer] : Oh, hi Cameron. I was just looking up to get a quote for my mum and dad, some insurance for my mum and dad, but with the quote paid, it's asking for my dad. Like, like how do I do it so I can get a quote for them on their behalf?
[22 seconds][Agent] : So for what type of insurance? Sorry.
[26 seconds][Customer] : Funeral insurance.
[28 seconds][Agent] : Sure, I can assist you in going through that. So you're looking at funeral insurance on behalf of your mum and dad.
[33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[33 seconds][Agent] : Do you want to, uh, to start with is either the name, so I can, uh, just so you know, you can set up a policy on their behalf. Umm, and they can both be insured together under a joint policy.
[38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[45 seconds][Agent] : Umm, you, you usually you would put, uh, one of the names is a primary person insured and then the, the second person is a second life insured. The only difference is the primary life insured can choose up to five beneficiaries. The second life insured, if they would pass prior to the first, their money simply goes back to primary life insured.
[45 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, yeah, OK. Yeah.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So is there a preference for you in terms of who you would nominate as that primary life insured? OK. And his name is.
[1 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : So my dad, David, David Harmi H Double AMI.
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : H Double AMI, did you say?
[1 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yep.

[1 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : And his date of birth, 1958. And with your dad, with David, he's of course a male Australian resident, correct?
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yes.

[1 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Lori. Lori. Yeah. Lori.

[1 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Hi, Cameron.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : If you miss my name, it's Cameron or Cam if you prefer.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Hey, how are you Lori with your mum? Let that her in as well. Just give me a second to pop the profile up now. Oh, sorry. Before we go through your mum's details, what's the best e-mail for you Lori?
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : So my name, Lori LORIH, doubleami@live.com dot AU.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : What to send information over to you.com dot AU And with respect to the number that I'm speaking to you on right now ending in 544, is that the best contact number to list on the profile?
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, that's my number.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, so with your mum, what's her first name?
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Linda, Linda.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : And is she also a a honey?
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : HWMI and her date of birth please?
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : H Double AMI the 13th of the 10th, 1958.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : I thought you were about to give me your dad's birthday and then they're both on the 13th. And of course your mum's a female Australian resident, correct?
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Let's head her in one second. Now with respect to the the life, sorry, not life, I think the funeral insurance cover, it's really straightforward. So I'll explain how it works. I'll take you through some costs to find an amount that's gonna suit your needs.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : But in essence, it's a guaranteed acceptance product so long as the person being insured is an Australian resident between the ages of 40 and 79, which is why I was asking about gender and residency.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So it's both of your parents are in that age category, so it's fine. And they're both guaranteed acceptance.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Because it is a guaranteed acceptance, it does mean that for the 1st 12 months they're gonna be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only after the first four months. It will then cover them to death during any cause, including a terminal illness benefit. Which means after holding deposit for the that first 12 months, if they were then first diagnosed with a terminal illness for 12 months or less delivered by a medical practitioner, the full the full comp can be paid directly to them to help with any costs they may face such as medical expenses. Knock on wood.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, perfect.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Of course, with the with the accidental death component, it pays out triple the deficit amount and with the accidental CIS injury, it covers them up until the policy anniversary following his 75th birthday and it pays out triple the benefit amount and it covers events such as quadriplegia or paraplegia.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK with the cost Loy it, it's a a premium that's designed to stay the same as they get older. So it's not going to go up each year at their age, in other words.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : And once they reach there, you're ready for it.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : So that's the repayment.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : But yeah, the premium is the amount you pay on a a fortnightly monthly or annual basis to keep the cover in place. It's not a savings or investment con scheme. So it's not a repayment per SE. It's like other, it's same as other insurances where you're agreeing to pay a certain amount in order to be insured for a certain amount. So please be aware that this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. EE meaning that if you were to cancel outside of the 30 days, your parents cover would stop and they would not receive anything back. OK.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, OK. Yeah, in next 30 days. Yeah. But there's no sorry. So there's no reason why you would cancel it though, you know what I mean?
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : The other thing to be the 30 days that I'm sorry, I mean, I, I, I mean, obviously that's, that's a question that's difficult to answer because I don't know the future.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : I don't know if there's any reasons why you would a, an example that could come to mind, for example, would be that, you know, there might be some sort of financial distress, distress.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, let you know.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : It's up to you being being able to afford the repayments even in that, even in that situation, my advice would be call us and tell us about the circumstances because we'll always try and work with you to keep the Co, the cup in place, even if it means, you know, temporarily putting it on the hold or something of that nature to help you out. OK.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. Yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : And of course you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount, depending on how long your parents of course live. I'm hoping for you and your parents that the long life and a happy, healthy 1.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Thank you. Thank you.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : You're welcome. But once they reach the age of 85, they're no longer required to pay anything further at all.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So the premium cease from the age of 85 and upwards.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : And at that stage, two additional things happen. Firstly, a bonus 25% cover gets applied to the benefit amount.
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : And then secondly, an early cash option is triggered, meaning that any time after the age of 85, they can voluntarily choose the end to cover early and will pay out 75% of the funeral insurance benefit while they're still living. So a bit of flexibility just in case circumstances change in the future.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : And obviously the idea of the cover is to pay that that cash benefit directly to your parents, chosen loved ones, anywhere from $3000 is a minimum to $16,000 as a maximum.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : And of course everything I've just discussed including information about our premium structure is all available as further information on our website.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Perfect. Thank you.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, you're welcome. And just on the note of not maintaining the cover, the 30 days that I was referring to is the cooling off.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Attached to the policy, meaning that in the 1st 30 days from the first payment made, I have a full 30 days in which it's fully refundable and unless claims be made. OK. So hopefully it's nice and clear. We'll go through some costs now, unless you've got questions for me.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : No, no, you've explained everything perfectly. Thank you.
[7 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : You're very welcome. No problems at all. I'm glad to help with the cost. It's obviously going to be dependent on the amount that you select, but the other factor that determines the cost is simply the age of the commencement of policy. So given that both of your parents are both 66 years old or young, depending on which way you look at it, it's going to be the same cost for them both.
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, what amount would you like to look at first? I'll load something up to give you an idea of the cost and we can navigate up or down to find the best fit for your budget. But as a starting point, what are, what are you thinking?
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Well, the most is 15,000. So what is that repayment? So what kind of the most of them, don't you reckon?
[8 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Again, it's tricky to answer that question because it's so circumstantial.
[8 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : For example, or some people. Yeah, let's look, let's look for you. So if you're looking at $15,000 each, it's gonna work out to be, per fortnight, $58.47 each.
[8 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : So how much would the repayments be to start at the 116?
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So together that would be $116.94.
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, now everyone's different with respect to what they can recently afford. So how about in your circumstances? Or is that going to be something that would fit into the budget?
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 100%.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : And I think, OK, and do you want me to look at anything lower? I can come down and find something, that's what.
[8 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm happy to pay $116 a fortnight for my mum and dad.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I was.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : If you're happy with that cost and you're otherwise happy with the terms and conditions of the policy, we can start this straight away for you now when we get it set up.
[8 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, Go ahead.
[8 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Perfect. No, I'm happy. I'm so stoked. I thought you were going to say like, I don't know, like $500 a fortnight. So I was a bit stressed because you were getting really intense. But 116 dollars is definitely reachable.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, Sorry, it sounds really intense.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's kind of really intense.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : I didn't mention it, sorry.
[9 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm definitely happy to pay $116.95 a fortnight to get my parents covered for $15,000.
[9 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK Pete ship.
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : If that's the most that you guys offer, then I'm definitely happy to pay that amount, $100. Just crazy.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK great. So I'm glad you're happy, but let's firstly confirm address details and then I'll jump into the payment window for you.

So the first question I asked. Do you understand and agree with the declaration?
[20 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[20 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : And secondly, would you like any other information or would you like me to read any part of the PDS to you?
[20 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : So when so will it always say $116.94 until we take it out or can it go up?
[20 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : It's possible that it can go up because obviously the future is never guaranteed, right? The idea of the policy is to keep that consistent and the same for you each year.
[20 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[20 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : But we we make it clear that there is possible circumstances where that could increase. If it ever does it increase, it's only going to be in the case where the insurer C makes that AP that change consistently across all policy holders of the same type.
[20 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[20 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : In that situation, we're going to still give you notice at least 90 days before the effective date of the change to the last notified address that you've given to us.
[21 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : So how go up?
[21 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, an example, an example for you.
[21 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : How often like has it, does it go up, do you reckon?
[21 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Sorry to to my knowledge, I don't know of it of having it occurred.
[21 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[21 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Now to be fair, I've been in the business for two years, but I've asked this question before and no one I work with on the floor can remember it going up. I've worked with people who have been here for 10 years.
[21 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK, Well, yeah, OK. Perfect.
[21 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, So it's not something that's common.
[21 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : So like double?
[21 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : It's I again, I, I don't I can't imagine that'd be the case, but I can't say with a certainty on recording that it won't because I I don't know the future. So that would not be a fair statement to say no, it never will because I just don't know the future. But I'd be so shocked. I honestly, it'd be my drawer would hit the ground if it doubled because the think of it like this. Louis.
[21 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[21 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : The only the only situation or a situation, hypothetically speaking, where this may happen, right, is let's say a natural disaster happens. Millions of Australians claim simultaneously and to prevent the insurer from going underneath to to prevent them from, you know, fo folding, they need to change the policy rates to keep the business afloat. That could be an example where this might increase. Otherwise, the intention of this policy is to remain the same.
[22 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[22 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Does that help you?
[22 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Perfect. Yeah.
[22 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[22 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[22 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So no, that's OK. I, I hope that gives you GA clarification. As I said, I don't want to make you feel like you're being misled.
[22 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Guaranteed.
[22 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : We just can't on recording, say with 100% certainty in the future. It's never going to change. OK, that makes sense.
[22 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yes. So do you reckon it went up before COVID, like after, did it go up a bit? You know what I mean? Like.
[22 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : I I don't re recall anyone saying it has. Yeah, I know. I know what you mean, but I don't recall anyone saying that it did. I think the policy actually changed not long after COVID. I think it's a slightly different policy from the one that was prior. But again, yeah, it's possible that it can happen.
[23 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Decide what you're. Yeah. OK.
[23 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : If that ever happened, you'd still get 90 days of notice to to make some sort of change exactly to your last notified address to us.
[23 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Thanks.
[23 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, you're very welcome. Is there any other questions or are you happy for me to accept this for you now?
[23 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm happy for you to accept it.
[23 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Cool. I'm gonna accept that in your path. Now with respect to sending the documents out, Lorrie, we're gonna send them out within 5 working days.
[23 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[23 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : In the post, you'll get an e-mail copy, usually within minutes, but certainly within an hour.
[23 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[23 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Please read through and just make sure it's all in order. As we've discussed today.
[23 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Perfect.
[23 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : If there's anything that's not right, give us a call straight back. Otherwise, don't forget to get your parents to nominate the beneficiary so it it makes it nice and easy for you when that time comes down the line, OK? And the one thing that I haven't mentioned up until now is that included in this policy is what we call a real reward and what that means, Louise, following the first policy anniversary date, we're actually going to refund you 10% of the premiership paid in that time, OK? So after that first anniversary, it'll get popped back into your bank account, which will be something like $304.00 based on the quote that we're looking at.
[24 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[24 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, thanks again for your time.
[24 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Perfect.
[24 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : I'm really glad I was able to sort that out for you. Is there anything else I can help you with?
[24 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no, thank you. You've been amazing. Thank you so much.
[24 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : My pleasure. Listen, all the very best to you and your family. Take care, Mancha.
[24 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Thank you, Cameron. See you later.
[24 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : My pleasure. Bye bye.
