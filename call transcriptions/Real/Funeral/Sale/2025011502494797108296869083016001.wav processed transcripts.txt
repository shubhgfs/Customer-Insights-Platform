And once that's all wrapped up, I'll make sure to get you through to our support team. So that way we can nominate your son as the beneficiary as well as the DAU, your daughter for this policy as well. OK, now that'll be in full.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, correct.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So it reads here. Thank you either Charmaine Lovell, it is important to understand the following information. Our last few agreements. These terms at the end, excuse me and your policy will not be enforced unless you agree these terms in full. The funeral cover is issued by H Hanover Library of Australasia Ltd, whom you referred to as Hanover Canada is arranged with grants and financial services training as real insurance to issue and arrangements insurance on behalf.

[7 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : None.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : If you agree to take out a single real funeral color with the following color uh Edith's Charmaine level is covered for $15,000 in the event of death In the case where it death is accidental the benefit amount will triple coverage accidental death only for the 1st 12 months to cover with death may cause or diagnosis of terminal illness covered thereafter most of that yeah so that that policy is separate from this one that is already in force still in place OK because yeah this policy is just the 15,000 say again sorry.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : What about that 7000 of Yeah, yeah, 7000 of paid so far it hasn't gone up any further. How come it hasn't gone up any further? 7000, that's it been for a couple of years now.
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because that's the amount you took out the policy at I believe.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Oh yes, yes, Yep, that's fine.
[7 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : MMM, easy, no problems. So yes, like I said, ESL main level is covered for $15,000 in the end of death. In the case where death is accidental, the benefit amount will triple. Covers the accidental death only for the 1st 12 months to cover. We definitely need cause or diagnosis of a terminal illness covered thereafter. Once a life insured reaches age 85, you can choose to voluntarily cancel that person's cover to receive a lump sum payment of 75% of the chosen benefit amount. If you take up the cash and option, you'll no longer have a right to claim under the policy for that life insured. And this policy is an insurance policy and does not have a savings or investment component. You can end your cover at any time by contacting us. Uh, if you stop paying your premiums, they end your cover. We'll give you notice for doing so. If cover ends prior to age 85, no benefit is payable and there's no refund of premiums after off. If cover continues beyond age 85, the life insured receive an additional 25% of bonus cards on that date and you're not be required to pay any further premiums. The bonus cover is not payable. The early cash option hasn't taken out.
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : None.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Cards are each life insured into the day prior to their 100th birthday. We'll pay the funeral benefits and bonus cards for life insurance. That's fine. Your total premium first year of cover is $113.87 per fortnight. Your premium is a level, which means they're designed to stay consistent here and here. It'll only change the on cover or the insurer adjust the premium rates. But yes, but uh, again, Charmaine, this is just an individual policy. There's two separate policies. So for this policy, you're paying $113.87 a fortnight and then your existing $7000 cover, umm, that has its own, uh, premium. So then when you add those two together, you get that other figure.
[9 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Sorry love, I thought you'd get 100 and 4700 dollars I'd have to pay fortnight and Oh yes yes.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, I'll give you the example of that, umm, at the end, umm, Otherwise your premium is a level, which means they're designed to stay consistent year on year. It will only change if you alter your cover or the insurer adjust the premium rates applying to your policy. The insurer can make only make a change if it's applied consistently across all policyholders. You may pay more in premiums than the benefit amount of the left policy, including in your premium. There's an amount payable to real insurance of between 34% and 54% calculated on a lower basis over left policy. Your premium be debited from your nominated bank account in the name of the Chamen level which authorized them from and have provided to us may provide.
[10 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : You can't get cancelled. I know the child 9 level up.
[10 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Sorry. What was that?
[10 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Is that all right?
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Could you just repeat what you said one more time? Yeah, Yeah, that's definitely fine.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : If you know the Charmaine level me back, is it OK?
[10 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, that's definitely fine. That's what we've got right in here.
[10 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Hey, is this, Yeah, uh, E the Charmaine level, which you're authorized from and have provided to us. Uh, we may provide communications to you by the e-mail address you provided to us, and this will include the legal notices we require provide to you in writing.

They pre may have paid the refund in full unless you watch a claim. Uh, there are risks associated policies as your new policy may have been identical to your existing cover. That's alright.
[11 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : They'd like to try to bring me a little lead.
[11 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : There's only a couple sentences left. Uh, we recommend you don't cancel the existing policy until you have received and reviewed our policy in full. And finally, we have a complaints process which you can access any time by contacting us with the towers available online and the documentation we're sending you. So just two final questions for wrap up here. Charmaine. Firstly, do you understand and agree with the declaration, yes or no? Uh, do you understand and agree with the declaration? Yes or no? Yeah.
[11 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Beg your pardon?
[11 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, it's alright. Is there anything you need me to repeat before we before we wrap up?
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Well, you don't take any more than what's data credit of the bank, do you?
[12 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yes, Sir. Can you repeat the question? What's up?
[12 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : You don't take any more money. You only just got to take each one every fortnight out of my account, don't you? This one?
[12 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yes. Then, uh, what the premium is, is umm, what is, uh, what you'd be paying on this policy? So, umm, it'd be the $113.87 a fortnight from this policy and then, uh, the other remaining amounts from your existing $7000 cover as well.
[12 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. That's all that's up together, isn't it?
[12 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that tho those two would, yeah, that's so I'm adding, I can add those together quickly, uh, in a moment as well. I'll bring up what your other premium was.
[12 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : $147 and something. It was the other day.
[12 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right. Just a smidge. Just a smidge. Over $147 a fortnight. A fortnight in total. I'll get the exact ticket for you momentarily, but yeah. Is that clear? That up for you?
[12 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So that's $147. That's with the both policies together, isn't it? A fortnight?
[12 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Just to tie it on the 148 a fortnight. I'll bring you up the exact thing momentarily when I can, but yeah.
[13 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Oh, you, you've made it out anyway because we've discussed it anyway.
[13 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : So you've got all everything you need, I think.
[13 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Alright. No dramas then. So in that case, Charmaine, again, do you understand and agree with the declaration? Yes or no?
[13 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[13 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yep.

[14 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Umm, all that up to date. Otherwise, before we can do that, I just need to make sure I've answered these two questions compliantly here. So Edith, once again, do you understand and agree with the permission just a yes or no? And would you like any other information or would you like me to read any part of the PDS to you? Yes or no?
[14 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yes, if I wanted to, if I didn't want to do it anymore. You don't get the money back there. You don't get a refund.
