[27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's correct.
[29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Well, let's have a look now. Just because it's the first time I'm speaking with you, could I just get you to reconfirm your full name and date of birth for me, please?
[38 seconds][Customer] : Angela Leanne Bridge, 27th, 11th, 46.
[43 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. And you are a female Australian resident, is that correct?
[49 seconds][Customer] : That's right.
[50 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. So all calls are recorded. Any advice that provides general in nature may not be suitable to your situation. Now, what I'm going to do, just because it has been quite a while since you did have that policy, I'm just going to take you through and just rejoge your memory in terms of what's actually covered. And then we'll have a look at the different options in terms of premiums and the level of cover. You just let me know if you do think of any questions along the way.
[50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : And I've got to change my address and phone number. Alright.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Are you ready to write?
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yep.
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yep that's fine, we could do that for you, no issues. Alright so with our policy do just keep in mind for the 1st 12 months you'd be covered for accidental death only after the first 12 months you'd be covered for death due to unique cause. Now we do triple the payout in the event of an accidental death and there is a terminal illness benefit. So this means that after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we then pay that claim out in full to help with things like medical costs. Your premiums are designed to stay the same each year for you as well, and you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. Any questions before we go through pricing?
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : No.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : No Perfect. So cover the range between 3000 up to $15,000. We can look at as many amounts as you like, but what amount did you want to have a look at first?
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : What did I have before?
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : She said it was 8000 that you had before. Did you want to look at 7000 first? Sorry.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Was it 7 08 logic?
[2 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No, No, stick with the with the aid or just depending on what the payment is.
[2 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : I'll give you another, of course, Yeah, because they are based on your age and time of application.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : You know, the payments have probably gone up now, yeah.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So the banking is being 78 now, but let's have a look at the 8000 and we can work our way down if we need to. So $8000 would be $88.76 per fortnight, so roughly $44.00 per week.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : And yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, that, yeah.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Do you think that would be manageable or did you want to have a look at? Yeah.

[4 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK, we'll post everything out to you. Now. This policy will also include an early cash out option for you as well. So, umm, this means that once you reach the age of 85, you can choose to end the cover. We'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit and just keep in mind you may pay more in total premiums over the life the policy than the benefit amount. As I've mentioned though, your premiums are designed to stay the same each year, but this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you do cancel outside of the 30 days, the cover will stop and you will not receive anything back. Of course, unless you are eligible for and choose the early cash back offer.
