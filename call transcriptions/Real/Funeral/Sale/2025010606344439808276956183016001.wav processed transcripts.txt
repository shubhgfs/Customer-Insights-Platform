[1 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes, yes, that's alright.
[2 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Thanks so much for confirming all of that with me, Vicky. So in terms of this one, I can see you do have that policy for 6000 at the moment. If we were wanting to up that to 10,000, the way that we do that is actually by starting up another policy of 4000 to make that total be 10,000 that you hold with us.
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Oh, righto.
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So what I'll do is I'll explain how the cover work for that, umm, additional 4000 of cover. And if you have any questions for me, please feel free to jump in.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Stop me at any point and yeah, we'll try and find something affordable and suitable for you to help get that all up.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : I just thought 6000's just a bit. It's not really with the price of everything now, it's just cutting it a bit little.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Oh, oh, and yeah, we can certainly help you.
[2 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Have a look at something a bit higher, an additional 4000 as you've requested.
[3 minutes][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : But in terms of this one, this is just for the additional 4000 what I'm explaining right now.
[3 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[3 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So for the 1st 12 months you'll be covered for accidental deaths and accidental serious injury only. Then after the first 12 months you'll be covered for death due to any course and that's regardless of if it's a pre-existing condition or anything like that.
[3 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, Beautiful. Yep. Yep.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Then in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you're first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner in that very unfortunate case, you pay the funeral insurance, yeah, to you and full. So you get while you're still alive, dealt with things like medical costs and that way you complain for the future accordingly with loved ones.
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, OK. Yep.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : You know, a couple of last things to notice that the cover does provide you with an early cash out option.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Just means any time after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover. And if you do, we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. And plus you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit of them. So just please be aware this insurance is not of the savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your couple will stop and you don't receive anything back unless you're eligible for and choose that early cash back. I just explained.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : That's of course for a top up.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : I won't be doing that.
[4 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. That's of course for a top up. We're able to look from 3000 to 15,000.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So you're wanting to look at an additional 4000 so that the totally hold is 10.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : I reckon, you know, like, yeah, I think so.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. And I do have a pricing one up for that additional 4000. Thank you.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, not really. I was just doing a new will. I'm just, oh, look, you just don't know, mate, you know, because when I did it, I think I did 2017, you know, the price of everything's just so much more now, you know, You just, I just don't want the kids to be paying anything. I passed away, you know.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Before we go through that, is there any questions for me so far or sounding pretty straightforward and and it's lovely to look into that for your kids, but it is all sounding pretty straightforward though what we've gone through.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, I'm just having information anyway, you know, I'm not going through churches and any of that crap. But, you know, I just. Yeah.

[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Oh God, mate. Yeah, that's fine.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : But well, today, Vicky, for the 4000 of additional cover, you'd be looking at an additional $12.82 on top of what you're currently paying.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : That's beautiful. Yep.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : And of course, your premiums are designed to stay the same each year rather than going through the increases.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : And of course, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. But thinking for the additional 4000 I've covered at $12.82 a fortnight, do you feel that would be affordable and suitable for you?
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's fine. That's fantastic. Yep. OK.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : All right, perfect.
[6 minutes][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Well, the next step from here then, if that is sounding affordable and suitable, it's gonna be to help provide you with some immediate cover and send out all the documentation for this top up policy.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so it'll be two policies you hold with us, one to 6001 to 4000.
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep. That's that sounds fair. Yep.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Now in terms of this one, we don't require upfront payment today.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : I can see that your next payment for the other one is actually scheduled to come out on Thursday the 16th.

[6 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Can you OK? Thank you.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So it lines up with your other policy and I just need to double check with you for this additional 4000 cover, $12.82 a fortnight. So can you Happy to continue.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, please.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : All right, perfect. Now for your security, of course, we're unable to just copy and paste your, umm, payment details from the other policy.
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK. Oh, OK.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : It is encrypted after we put it in. I can see you're using direct debit though, which is a BSB and account number, is that right?
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yeah, that's correct.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So we will need to collect that again.
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : That's all that's one, that's a, that's a savings.
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Is that a savings or a check account that's under your name? Vicky Bevendorf.
