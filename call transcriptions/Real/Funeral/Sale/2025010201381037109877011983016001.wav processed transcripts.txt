I don't have my reference but your colleague told me that for a month it's free and then I can cancel it within that month and then I have another month cooling off the so I don't have to pay anything for a month.
[31 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[32 seconds][Customer] : I was wondering if you can activate my my my my my insurance if you can find the reference. I'm not sure.

[58 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Alright, give me one second.

[1 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : And also just confirming that you are an Australian resident as well.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm pressure.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Please. Our calls are recorded. I can see you're speaking to David. I'll just see if he's available for you to help you with this. Again.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Thanks.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Give me one second. OK. I won't be long.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : OK, thanks.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Oh, are you? Thank you for holding the alley. OK, so Dave is just currently not interested, but I'll be happy to help you with that. Fine.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK, thanks.
[2 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Umm, just to confirm the other contact details that we have on your profile, make sure that's still correct. So once we set up the insurance, you get an e-mail copy and a hard copy.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah. The next day. That's correct.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Your e-mail I have here is, AH, doubleomank@gmail.com, phone number 0493758410 and your address unit 17/1. Uh, Clara Industry Hornsby NSW 2077.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Thank you and perfect. So what I'm gonna do? Just quickly rehash the policy for you very quickly and uh, we'll show you that pricing again. Uh, and if you have any questions, you can certainly just ask me, but I'll be very quick for you. Basically, again, just so you understand the real funeral cover, what it's designed to do is to provide a cash benefit that's paid directly to your nominated beneficiaries. You can choose between $3000 up to $15,000 cover and then you can nominate up to five people as your beneficiaries to apply for the cover. There's no medical checks or blood tests. Basically as long as you're an Australian resident age between 40 and 79, acceptance is guaranteed for you. Just when you start the cover, there are waiting periods. So keep in mind for the 1st 12 months you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only and then after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause.
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we will pay your claim in full to you to help with things like medical expenses.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll tell you very good. Thanks.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now your premiums are designed to stay the same as you get older and when you reach the age of 85, your premium will cease, so you'll have nothing more to pay and you'll also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover that would be applied to your benefit of that, OK. You can also find information about a premium structure on our website and your cover also provides you with an early cash at options. So at any time after you reach the age of 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, sure, sure.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now this, uh, you can choose now between $3000 up to $15,000 cover. How much funeral insurance cover did you wanna take a look at, Sir? 15,000, That one per fortnight, Ali is $42.42 per fortnight.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK. Now attached to your policy, we have a real rewards, meaning following your first policy anniversary date, we will refund you 10% of the premiums you've paid in that time back to your hand. So you get back $110.30. And we also provided you with the free online legal will valued at $160.00 with each policy. OK, Now keep in mind this policy is a worldwide cover. So we do protect you 24 hours, 7 days worldwide. It is flexible as well. So if your situation changes, you can give us a ring and apply to reduce the policy. Or if you ever wanting additional cover, you can apply for a separate top up policy as well subject to eligibility. And you can do that as long as the total that you have with us does not exceed about $15,000. It is an insurance policy. So we'd like to let you know you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK, thanks.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : And just please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or an investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK. Do you have any questions for me so far, Sir? Or is that all sounding clear and straightforward?
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Alright. PSJ 14, the name of the beneficiary now.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : That's you can give to us once the policy is set about and transfer you to customer support so they can help you do it. We'll do that for you.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, so you've chosen the 15,000. Just need to ask, are you happy to continue with that amount, Sir? OK, beautiful. You don't need to pay anything today. As Ma, as David's mentioned, we just nominate a payment date and the payment method of your choice. What day would you like to nominate as a first payment date?
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Any day. Any day that suits you.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so it's only up to you at the end of the day. You can choose a payday or pension day, whatever suits because it's set up as a direct debit. Sir.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Honestly.
[6 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So what day would you like to nominate for your first payment to come out on?
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Honestly, it doesn't make a difference. Any day there's more funds than you can. Or perhaps perhaps on a Friday.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, on a Friday.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, so you can choose which Friday do you want to put it on. Sir. Again, you can choose any day in the next 30 days.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : What do you mean day after Friday?
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Which day?
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Just let me know which amount, which day you would want to put it on. I can choose that for you.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Uh, I thought the first month was for free though.
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Umm, So if you make the first payment, let's say for example 30 days from today, you're still covered from today onwards. And yes, you're covered until the your first payment date, which is whichever day you choose. And then yeah, at that extra time applied onto your policy, which is a calling off period of 30 days.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK. And then and then like a Friday that's closest to the 30 days because today is a Thursday.
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure.
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : So I think it'd be 20, umm, 4 days from now, wouldn't it?
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Let me check for you the furthest. Furthest I could do. The furthest Friday I could do would be the 31st of January. Is that OK for you?
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Is that all right? OK, Now one moment. And as a payment method, you can link it up to a Visa MasterCard or a BSP account number. What payment method would you like to nominate, Sir? OK, so it's easier for security purposes while obtaining your card details, the call recording will stop and we'll recommend after we have collected your details. So I'll just pause that with. The. The.
