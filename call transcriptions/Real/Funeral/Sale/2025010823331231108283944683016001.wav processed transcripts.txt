[57 seconds][Agent] : So I'll, I'll, I'll change this name. OK. Umm, just so I can have a bit of understanding of why you're looking into funeral insurance today. Are you new to or do you currently have some cover in place?
[1 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : No, I haven't.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem.
[1 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So the purpose of my call was to just run you through all the features and benefits and I can get you some pricing as well. And then you can just decide where you want to go from there. And feel free to just stop me at any point in time if something doesn't make sense or if you have any questions.
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Sorry. Go on.
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, no questions. I just wanted to I'd seen it on today. The program. Yeah.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, no problem. And so our cover is designed to provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to your loved ones in the unforeseen event of your passing. Now they can use the funds not only for the funeral expenses, but also any other final expenses like unpaid bills. And you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated amount. Now if this is due to an accident, the chosen benefit does triple as well.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Say for example of 15,000 would be 45,000 in the event of an accidental death.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : And just just to know as well, if you were to suffer an accidental serious injuries such as quadriplegia or paraplegia before the policy anniversary following your 7th, 5th birthday, the benefit amount will also triple. In that case and for the 1st 12 months, you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months, you'll be covered for death due to any cause. In addition, there is a terminal endless benefits, which means after holding a policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less live by a medical practitioner, we will pay your claim in full to help you with things like medical expenses.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep, correct.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : And obviously we don't wish we, we pray we none of these situations actually happen. But it's just, I guess it's there just in case, you know.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, it does happen, yes.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, let's, let's hope it doesn't happen. But yeah, so that that is covered for you in in those scenarios as well. Now you can choose between $3000 and up to $15,000. And a couple of things to know. Your premiums are designed to stay the same as it's older.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : And when you reach the age of 85, your premium cease completely. So we have nothing more to pay. And you also, you will also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover, which would be applied to your benefit amount. Now, on the other hand, when you do reach the age of 85, we have another option, which would just be called an early cash option. So what that means is you can choose to end your cover and we will pay you 75% of the federal insurance benefits. And that is when you reach the 85 years of age. And yeah, and you can also find more information about our premium structure on our website.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Right, right, right, right, right.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So let's just go through some pricing together.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So as I mentioned, we can go anywhere from 3000 and up to 15,000.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : I was looking at 15.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : What amount we'd like me to quote you for first 15.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, No problem. OK, so for $15,000 you're looking at a fortnightly premium payment of $46.03 and we do have something called a real reward attached to the policy. So following your first policy anniversary date, we will refund you 10% of of the premiums you've paid in that time, which would mean you get a refund of $119.69. We do also provide you with a free online legal bill which is worth $160.00 with each policy. Is that sounding affordable for you there? Yeah, good to hear. So just note as well, you may pay more on total premiums of the life of the policy than the benefit amount. Please be aware this insurance is not does not have a savings or an investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back unless you are eligible for and choose the early get back offer I was mentioning earlier. Now what I can do for you today is actually get you immediately covered over the phone and I'll send you all the tailored policy documents to review. You do have a 30 day cooling off.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : So you can take your time look through the documents regardless and and the unlikely event you decide this policy is not suitable, you can just give us a call and apply to get it canceled.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : What?
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : In that case, all premiums, if you have paid any will be refunded to you and and we can cancel that policy unless the claim has been made after this cover, you're not actually required to pay anything today. What we do would be either enter your dirt, give the details or your card details and you can select the payment date within the next 30 days. Are you happy to continue?
