[2 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yes, you did.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. So sorry the phone was a bit delayed there and I'll quickly let you know calls are recorded. Any advance advisory nature may not be suitable to your situation. Sorry. Between the 3015 thousand, my colleague has said that you wanted to look into the 15,000, is that correct?
[2 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. And what? He's quoted you as well. The amount was $76.85 a full 9. Is that suitable for yourself there?

[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Perfect. Alright, so I'll just quickly explain how the cover works as well. So if your death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit amount will triple. OK, So that 15,000 actually becomes $45,000 for you, OK And for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause. OK?
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So in addition, we do also have a protection for you. So there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less lived by a medical practitioner such as cancer, we will pay the claim amount in full to you while you are still alive. OK, So you can use money for medical costs, day-to-day expenses, or just plan out the future, Alright. And mm, hmm.
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Oh OK OK so when is like there was terminal and I get paid out and I'm still alive but if I die that funeral benefit is void?
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because the payout is already made out to you.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I gotcha.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So premium are designed to stay the same, Erika, as you get older.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So and when you reach the age of 85, your premium will cease, meaning you have nothing more to pay and your cover will continue for free, OK, Yeah. Plus you will receive the 25% bonus cover that can supply to that benefit amount as well. And information about our premium structures also available on our website. Erica, we do also provide you with an early cash out option. So anytime after you reach 85 years of age, you can actually choose to annual cover and we will pay you 75% the funeral insurance benefit. But that is optional. So if you do always check with my customer, if you do decide to have a big 85th birthday party, you know you have the money you can cash out, OK, beautiful.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : You go back out on the shoe box. Hey, bye.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : And that's right, go go clubbing beautiful. And you may pay more internal premiums over the lives of the policy than the benefit now. So please be aware this insurance does not have the savings or investment in on that. So if you cancel outside the 30 days, your cover will stop and you'll not receive anything back unless you're eligible for and choose the early cash back offer. OK Erica just also has a way of saying thank you to you for being our customer. We do have the real reward. So following your first policy anniversary day, we will refund you 10% of the premium you paid in that time. So you will get a cash back of $92.22 refunded back into your account.
