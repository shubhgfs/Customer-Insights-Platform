What's your date of birth then, please? 10846, Cheers. And you are a female and an Australian resident, you're 78, is that right?
[1 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Different, but the both of us, yes, 10846, that's correct.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Awesome, perfect. Thanks Vicky.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, correct.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : And also the e-mail we have here is vicky_white@optusnet.com dot AU fantastic. Well. Please, keep in mind bigger that all of our calls here are recorded and then the advice I PROVIDE today is generally nature may not be suitable to your situation there OK.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Alright.
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : FANTASTIC, and. So I've Got a better understanding on your situation would.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yes, we are. Yes. Just a bit of yes, exactly. Just a bit of insurance.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : It be a safe bet for me to assume that the funeral insurance is something that both you and your husband are considering to have that security in place so when the time comes, your family don't have to worry about it.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : So, so the children.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Bit of a financial buffer when that time comes.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Good on you. Well, that's it generally what it's designed to do. Thanks for letting me know. Again, what you'll notice is here at Choosey, we do make it really simple for you. So I'll quickly take you through the differences and jump in if you have any questions. OK. But we do compare with multiple different funeral insurance brands like the Australian Seniors Insurance, Real Funeral Cover as well as Guardian Funeral Insurance as well.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Umm, we don't compare all aspects of products available in the market. We are a related company to Greenstone Financial Services who distribute and administer the brand that I California that I can arrange for you today. Umm, each product does have different features, so it is important to consider this in combination with the price and the PDS before making a decision to purchase. OK, cheers. But all you'll notice is whichever brand you choose, it's really, really simple. In fact, can I confirm your husband is, is also an Australian resident between 40 and 79 years old, is that right? Fantastic. Well since you're both in that age group and you're both Australian residents and he, he was 79 I believe from that date of birth you've given me earlier, is that right?
[3 minutes][Customer] : OK, yes, yes, no, it's something on this year.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So 92. Perfect.
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : The end of the month.
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So that means yes.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, the end of the day.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So keep it, no worries. Well, since you're both Australian residents and you're both in that age group, this is a guaranteed acceptance insurance. So you neither of you need to visit a doctor, neither of you need to do any medical checks or blood tests. Even if you've been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past. You don't even need to tell us about them because we will still accept you both just the way you are.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK fantastic. But please be aware because of this reason for the 1st 12 months of the insurance you'll you're both only covered for accidental deaths only in the 1st 12 months.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : What?
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : But after the first 12 months it does cover deaths due to any cause at all.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Alright, it also includes a terminal illness benefit, which means after you've held the policy with us for 12 months, if either you or your husband were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by, medical practitioner will then pay the full benefit to you before passing. So you can actually use the money yourself, pay off the funeral in advance or whatever you need that money for at the time. OK, Hopefully Touchwood, you never get to use that, but great piece of my knowing it is included just in case for you. Now each of you can select between $3000 a cover up to a maximum of 15,000 each. But please keep in mind Vicky, that your premiums are designed to stay the same year on year as both you and your husband. You get older from now until you turn 85 years old. Once you reach 85 years old, the premiums will stop altogether and you will no longer have to pay your insurance. Of course, you're both still covered after 85, it's just the premiums that cease. OK, yeah. And as a reward, once you turn 85, you will you'll receive a bonus 25% cover, which we just add on to your insurance as a thank you for staying with us for so many years.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Alright, OK, alright.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : You can also find information about our premium instruction on our website. But fine, the 85 is a long time away. So we do provide you both with an option to cash out of the insurance. And this is optional, but at any time after 85, you can choose to end the policy and cash out 75% of the funeral insurance benefits. Should you want to do that, it's up to you and your husband. Any questions for me so far? I would like to explain that pretty clearly for you. Great. Perfect. Well, let me add your husband on. Can I get you to confirm his name and date of birth, please?
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Desmond. Yeah.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Umm Desmond Regional. Desmond Regional.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Why TH thank you. And what's his date of birth, please?
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : White 291146.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. Thank you. And he is a male and an Australian resident. And he is 78.
[5 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Let me add him on. Thank you. OK, well, what amount would you like to look at first? Again, you can choose between 3000 up to 15,000 each. I'll work out the cost for you and we can always adjust afterwards. Don't be shy. If it's too expensive, we can always work our way down. Or if you need more cover, I can just increase it until we find something suitable to leave behind for the family. OK. What amount would you like to look at first?
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : We're just very basic. We don't want anything fancy, just whatever needs to be done.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. Well, well, again, you can choose the amount itself if the minimum is 3000 and then it goes up from there in $500, the amount, so three and a half, 4004 1/2 etcetera, up to a maximum of $15,000.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I'd say I don't know. I've no idea what things cost these days.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Have you guys spoken together with you looking at a cremation or burial as yet?
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Oh, it's going to be cremations.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : It will be cremation.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : It's going to be cremations, yes.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. Well, actually I've got some some pricings here and you can double check the source of this yourself, Vicky, as well, if you like. The source is from thefinder.com website. It states on there that according to the government's Money Smart website, private funerals typically cost somewhere in the region of $4000 for a basic cremation up to the 15,000 for more detailed burial service.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, 4000, Yeah, yeah, sure. And Washington. And that was for each of you. 4000 each.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Well, just the 4000 should be Yep, that's correct.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Let's see. OK, so I'll quickly work it out for you now. Excuse me. Alright, here we go. So one of the brands coming in here is the Real Funeral Cover. Now the reason I'm starting with this brand for you is because with Real Dicky, they actually have a feature unique to them which none of the other brands we offer include with their insurance, which is called the Real Reward. What this means for you and theirs is once you've both held the policy with us for a year following your first 12 month anniversary date, we'll actually refund you back 10% of all the payments you paid into it just for staying loyal with us for a year. OK.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yes, right, right. OK.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : On top of this, with the real life insurance, the real funeral insurance, they also include a fully legalized will for you if you haven't got your will set up. If you have an old one there that needs updating, they'll include a brand new one for you. It's valued at 160 dollars. OK.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Well, well, I've got all that set up.
[8 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Oh perfect.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : That's Yep.
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Well it'll still come as a spare. Pass it on to a friend or family member if you like, but it does come for free for you.
[8 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Alright.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : And since you're both the same age and you both look at the same amount, the cost is identical for the both of you. There's no difference. It comes to $44.38 a fortnight for each of you. So in total $88.76 a fortnight.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[8 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, that is for the $4000 cover up. Now if you mind me asking there, Vicky, would you feel with that amount suit your needs GIF Desmond and the family that bit of financial cover in case something was happened to you? Would you rather look at a a different amount perhaps, maybe something lower or higher?
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Well, that's, I don't know. That seems to be achievable.
[9 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's manageable for you.
[9 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : That's yes, yes.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. And as I mentioned earlier, don't forget once you turn 85, remember you won't have to pay your $88.76 anymore, the premium fees and you'll each then receive a bonus 25% cover each. So your 4000 then convert to $5000 cover each once you turn 85 years old, OK. And that real reward that I mentioned the refund back based on this amount, you'll receive $230.76 refund following your first or month anniversary just for staying with real insurance for a year.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Alright, alright.
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, fantastic. So if that amount is right for you, if it's suitable and affordable, then as this is a guaranteed acceptance, what we arrange for you, Vici, is we both get you covered immediately. Once you end this call, you and Desmond will be covered. You're not required to make a single payment today.
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[10 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Of course, even though we're going to protect you immediately, we want to allow you some time to read over the documents, double check it first before the first payment comes out, but we'll still get it started on the way for you. So you got the ball rolling on the waiting periods.
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : That's good.
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : And the way that's all set up is once we've ended the call, you'll be protected in about 1520 minutes. You'll get all the documents sent off to your e-mail address.
[10 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : That'd be good.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : You'll have it there to read over in black and white very shortly with Desmond and yeah. And I'll also grab your postal and I'll arrange to have the hard copies posted to your mailbox. That'll come with your welcome pack and your beneficiary form as well. And they should arrive sometime next week in your mail. But you'll get the e-mail today.
[10 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Alright, No, fine.
[10 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And even though we don't take any payments of today, we'll let you select a day in the future that's comfortable for you. In Desmond, we'd WA day that you'd like for the first payment to be debited. I can push it up to a month's time from today, allowing you both enough time to read over the e-mail, double check the policy, make sure you're both 100% happy. Only then, if you're happy with it all, we'll debit out the payment from the from your account on the date you've chosen. It'll come out each fortnight on the same day there Vicky.
[10 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, that's not a problem.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Let's assume though you've changed your mind or after reading over the documents you were Desmond are not happy to go through that anymore. No worries, you don't need to stress out. There's no cancellation fees with us. You can call in and apply to cancel the policy altogether. You won't be penalized in any way. We will include a 30 day cooling off. For you. So should you cancel in the FIR in the 30 days, you'll receive a full refund back of all the premiums paid in that time, so long as no claims have been made. Of course. In the oven, passed away. Alright, that's all When I say that, of course. Fantastic. So let me just grab your address so I can arrange to have the hard copies posted off to you there. Vicky, could I start with the post code and suburb, if that's OK, please?
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep, it is 2153 Winston Hills.

[12 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : That's correct. Correct.
[12 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. Thank you, Vicky. So finally, last thing I need to ensure you understand is with this policy, you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. And please finally be aware that this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you won't receive anything back. So I do need to just make sure that you understand that.
[12 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yes, not a problem.
[12 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, Thanks a lot. And can I confirm that you're authorized to purchase this policy on behalf of your husband? Beautiful. And can I also confirm that you are happy to continue organise to get you both protected?
