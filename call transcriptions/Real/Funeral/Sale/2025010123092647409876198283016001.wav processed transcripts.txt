[1 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[2 seconds][Agent] : Good morning, Jodie. This is Praveen calling from real Insurance.
[9 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah.
[4 seconds][Agent] : I'm calling about some expression of interest left the line for some funeral insurance, just calling to assist you better with that.
[11 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, thanks. So Jodie, just to help you further with that, I'm just going to need to confirm your full name and your date of birth.
[17 seconds][Customer] : Jadie Lynette James, the 13th of the 5th, 1981.
[21 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful, Thanks for that. And Please note all of our calls are recorded. Any advice I provided in general nature and may not be suitable to your situation. And Jodie, can I please confirm you are an Australian resident, please?
[32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[33 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. So Jodie, just so I can have a better understanding how it got you looking into the federal insurance, I'm new to it here, some cover place. What was the main reason you put through that inquiry?
[43 seconds][Customer] : The husband and I've been talking about it for a while.
[48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So, umm, you're new to the market and you don't have a cover in place.
[45 seconds][Customer] : We haven't had anything about it, no.
[52 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. In that case, Jody, what I'll do is I'll go through the main features and benefits of our product and then, umm, we can go through some pricing together. So Jody, umm, our cover is designed to provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to your loved ones when you pass away. They can use those funds not only for fuel, umm, funeral expenses, but also any other final expenses like unpaid bills. So, umm, when that time or that unfortunate time does come, you know, it's, it's not a protection for ourselves really. It's more of a protection for our loved ones just so they're not left with that financial burden of having to carry out your funeral and the final expenses and stuff like that. So did you have anyone in mind that Jodie, that you wanted to nominate as a beneficiary to receive that money if the worst were to happen?
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep, My husband. Yeah.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So you can definitely nominate your husband as a beneficiary. In fact, you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive that nominated benefit amount. And if your death was due to an accident that Jodie, your chosen benefit amount will triple. So for example, if you went with the $15,000 worth of cover in the event of an accidental death, it'll umm, triple to $45,000 worth of cover.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, so it's easy to apply. There are no medical checks charity. As long as you're an Australian resident aged between 40 and 79, your acceptance with us is guaranteed. And just so you know, Jody, if you wanna suffer an accidental serious injury such as quadriplegia or paraplegia before the policy anniversary following 7th, 74th birthday, the benefit amount will also triple in that case.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep, OK.
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : And Jody, for the 1st 12 months, you'll be called for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months, you'll be covered for death due to any cause. In addition, Jodie, I hope you never have to use this benefit, but it is there for, you know, the worst case scenario really. But there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding a policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or lesser lived by a medical practitioner, we can pay out the claim in full. Just help with medical expenses and stuff like that in that tough time, OK?
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So Jody, you can choose cover between $3000 up to $15,000. And a few things to note there. Your premiums are designed to stay the same as you get older. And when you reach the age of 85, your premiums will cease. So you have nothing more to pay beyond that point. And you also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover, which will be applied to your benefit amount. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, Jodie, this cover also provides you with a early cash out option. So after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover and we'll pay you 75% of the fuel insurance benefit. But did you have any other questions relating to the cover so far that Jodie?
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : No, not really. I've read a lot of it on before. I did it online.
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful, beautiful. So in that case, we'll go through some pricing together.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. So I wanted to actually get my husband on the same thing though, so I wanted to have it closer.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I can definitely can do a joint policy with your husband on as well. So once we go into pricing, I'll add them on.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
