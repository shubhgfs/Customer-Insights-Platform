[1 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[3 seconds][Agent] : Hi, my name is George, I'm calling from Wheel Insurance. How are you today?
[7 seconds][Customer] : Hi, George. Yeah, it's Madeline. I'm good, thank you.
[10 seconds][Agent] : That's good. I was calling in relation to the online enquiry that was put through for the life insurance.
[10 seconds][Customer] : That's right.
[16 seconds][Agent] : Just so I can discuss it with you further. Could I get you to reconfirm your full name and date of birth for me please?
[22 seconds][Customer] : Madeline Joyce Williams, 2nd of April 70.
[27 seconds][Agent] : Bateson, you are a female Australian resident, is that correct?
[30 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[31 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. So all calls are recorded. Any advice that provides to normal nature may not be suitable to your situation. And what's prompted the enquiry today? What's great, looking into life insurance.
[43 seconds][Customer] : Well, my sister had it years ago when she was dying. She died of cancer.
[49 seconds][Agent] : Sorry.
[49 seconds][Customer] : And I just thought the way you guys handled it promptly send a bouquet of flowers. The money was straight into my account. So like, you know, didn't have to wait weeks to have her funeral.
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : There's a car.
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : And it was really good because it was very hard on my father at the time. He was one of those people that, you know, didn't like to wait. And so we got with it immediately, as soon as the money got in the bank. And yeah.
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I'm glad we could help in that aspect. Now you make sure it's for her funeral, but you put through an enquiry for life insurance.
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Oh.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Was it funeral cover that you needed or was it life insurance?
[1 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Oh, you don't cover? Yes, sorry.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : A funeral?
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : You don't put it in the wrong number.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, No, that's OK.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Oh. OK.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : No, that's right.
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Well, let me take you through how the funeral cover works and we'll go through just the name and features and benefits 1st and then once you've got that price, set it up, we'll have a look at the different options. But I do take you through it. Let me know if you have any questions. OK, perfect.
[1 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK, that'll be great.
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So the funeral cover, it's better make sure that if in the event you were to pass away, hope you're not for a very long time.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Excuse me.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : I'm sorry, just my husband's been playing up a little bit today.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : No, that's alright. Do you want to take a sip of water, nap it away?
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Sorry. That come out of the blue.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK. No, that's OK.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So I'm sorry. What was your name again? Georgia.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : My name's Georgia. Yes, that's right.
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, Georgia.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. Now I was just saying, just in regards to the funeral cover, I mean, hopefully nothing happens for a very long time, but it's just there to give you that Peace of Mind that if anything were to happen, there is money readily available so your family can use it to help cover the cost of the funeral themselves.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : We've just really experienced that literally on the 5th of December my sister-in-law passed away suddenly.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, No, yeah.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Did not, did not smoke, work six days a week, couldn't go out partying, anything. She had a pretty solemn life, took care of her elderly sister, is intellectual and head and just up and dies in her sleep. And the family struggled with money.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Goodness, it's horrible, isn't it?
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : And so it sort of me out of it.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, actually thinking.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : And we better get out of order because anything happens to us.
[3 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Exactly. I, I that's exactly right. Yeah. I mean, you know, it's tough as you know, the time's gonna be when it comes.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Our kids, you know, don't have to have that strain that married one minute.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : I mean, at least there's, you know, your families are having to try and find the money themselves to help pay it off. Exactly.
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, that's right.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right. So I mean, the application process, it's very easy. I mean, we do not require any medical checks. Regardless of your medical history.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. Only for 12 months.
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : You have guaranteed acceptance with us because of your age and your residency status, but for the 1st 12 months you'd be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only, and then after the first 12 months you're covered for death due to any cause. What was that?
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Is that only the first 12 months?
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, correct.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Could you continue that on?
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So for the 1st 12 months it's death, it's accidental death and accidental serious injury only during that 12 month period.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : And then after the first 12 months it is death due to any cause, whether it's accidental death, death due to an illness, due to natural causes, then on after. OK.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : OK, so it's accidental. Covered for accidental death and serious injury.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : An accidental serious injury. That's right. Yeah.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Accidental.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Because in that first 12 months, because we don't require you to go through any health checks or blood tests or anything like that, because you have guaranteed acceptance, we have to have that 12 month waiting period in place. Understandable. We know that accidents can happen, so that's why there's still coverage for that in that meantime. But yeah, after the first 12 months, it's due to any cause. Now, if at any point during the policy you were to pass away as a direct result of an accident, your family will receive triple the payout instead, just because we understand accidents are generally quite sudden, so there may be additional expenses left behind. So it's just to make sure your family's got that additional protection and there is a terminal illness benefit included as well. So after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we would then put that claim out in full, which can help with things like medical costs.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : The terminal illness one, I'm sorry.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. Yeah, certainly.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : I'm just quickly taking notes so I can explain it to my husband because I actually put his name down too.
[6 minutes][Agent] : Yep, Yeah, that's fine.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : I did one for him, so he'd probably get a phone call today too. Paul Williams. Yeah.
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Mm, hmm. That's fine.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : So what was the terminal I illness term? Sorry.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So it means that, so once you've taken out a policy after holding the policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness or a medical practitioner so that you've got 12 months or less to live, we would then pay that claim out to you while you're still alive.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : And then you can use that money to help, you know, with medical costs, the cost of medication, all of that. So it's up to you. You don't have to claim on it if you don't want to. You can leave it for the original reason, which was just the funeral cost. But it just gives you that added option that if you did want to use it to help cover those medical costs, you can now do keep in mind the premiums are level. So that means that they're designed to stay the same each year for you. OK.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yes, yeah, OK, good. Premium. Stay the phone.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Now we are up to pricing, but I just want to confirm, do you have any other questions as what I've explained so far?
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't. I don't think you're doing a beautiful job of explaining.
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Let's have a look at the different options we have now because being a funeral cover is going to range between 3000 up to $15,000. So I can quote you on as many amounts as you like, but how much coverage do you think you would need?
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I'd say do you have, Oh, there is one question. Do you have funeral cover and life insurance in the same like payment plan?
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Not in the same. They would. They're two different policies. You'd have to, yeah. If you wanted to look at life cover as well, we can, but it would just be a separate policy being taken out.
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah, we'll do the funeral one first.
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, No, that's fine. Now, how much coverage do you think you would need between 3000 up to 15? Yeah. Yeah. Let's have a look. That is a fortnightly premium of $35.47. That's fortnightly.
[8 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK, 15,000 all up, that sounds beautiful.
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : How is it sounding so far for you now? Do you want to look anything slightly low? Yeah, and $0.47 a fortnight.
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, can I just fortnightly 35 40170, we'll just say $0.50. Yep.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So that's just for you. Did you want to have a look at your partner as well?
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : And that's just a movable Yes, please.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Because you can do a joint quote.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : And I can use all these questions.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, that's fine. What's the same surname though, right? Williams. What was his first name again? Sorry, Paul. Thank you. And what's Paul's date of birth?
[8 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : B of Jess Paul, Paul Thomas, 23rd of the 1st 66.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : And he's an Australian resident as well. Is that right?
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes, he is.
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Now Paul's is going to be a little bit more just because we base your premiums on the level of cover, but also age, time of application. So because he's 58, his will be slightly different. But the fortnightly premium for Paul would be $40.82 per fortnight. So the total would be $76.29 a fortnight.
[9 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yep, 7629 a fortnight.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : That's correct. That's if you wanted to look at the 15,000 each. That is obviously the maximum. So we can go slightly lower if you would like to. Perfect.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : So no, no, that's fine.
[9 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful.
[9 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : We earn good money, it's fine, we'd like that. And do you split it up to weekly payments? OK.
[9 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yep, we only have the options of fortnightly, monthly or annually.
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No, that's fine. That's great. You know, that's that is really great.
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Perfect. Well, let's see. Are you happy to leave it at fortnightly? Yep.
[10 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : That's Yeah, we'll we'll have to.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : That's the only option you have.
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Now just with this one issue, I wanted to do it for Paul as well. Is that right?
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's right.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Both on the same policy. Excellent.
[10 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Same policy.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : I will be bored.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : W Absolutely. Yep, that's fine. Perfect.
[10 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : And the person the money goes to, if Paul drops dead before me, and that's why I drop dead before Paul, the money will go to him to cover me. That's good.
[10 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Now I've got beautiful and e-mail address.
[10 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : No, I won't put Paul there.
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's OK.
[10 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : I will put my daughter there. Yeah.
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. You can put your daughter down this one.
[10 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : I just gotta think of it. Yeah, she's actually got a cover with you. She's the one. Yeah. Reminded me of you guys.
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Now I've got an e-mail here. It's mjwills2019@gmail.com. Is that correct? And I'm just going to note down your address as well.
[10 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : That's correct, 4825. That's Mount Isaac.
[11 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : What's your post code and suburb?
[11 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Oh, park side.
[11 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Let's have a look.
[11 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : It'll come up Mount Isaac, Park side.
[11 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : What's the street number and name?
[11 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Oh, sorry. Yeah #6 9th Ave.
[11 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : 9th Ave. Perfect. Yep. Coming up as Parkside. Yep, and that's your postal address as well.
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : after yes.
[11 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Alright, excellent. Now do keep in mind with this policy, so the cover will include an early cash out option. So anytime after you reach the age of 85, you can choose to end the cover. We'd pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit, but you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. Now, you may pay more in total premiums over the last the policy than the benefit amount. As I mentioned though, your premiums are designed to stay the same each year and the insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, the cover will stop and you will not receive anything back. And of course, unless you are eligible for and choose the early cash back offer now to provide you both with cover, everything gets emailed and posted out to you for you to have a good read through everything. Now you do not pay anything today so you can choose your first collection date in the near future that suits you best. Now it's again up to you when you'd like that first payment date to come out. I just need to confirm for the call recording. Are you happy to continue, yes or no?
[12 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Please, I'm very happy to continue.
[12 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Now what date would you prefer the first premium to be debited again? You're both covered from today though.
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : The date would be next Thursday. Oh hang on, can we have a Friday?
[13 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yep, next Friday, that's the 10th. No, that's the 10th. Yep, that's right. And then it would be fortnightly there on after from that date. Now in the meantime, are we noting down a Visa or MasterCard or BSB and account number?
[13 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : I just got my wallet. I'm sorry.
[13 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : There is no, no worries.
[13 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : No, it's pretty safe. Your site with them, you know, haven't. We've been ripped off so many times in our bank.
[13 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Oh, no, that's, I mean, you can never be too careful these days. I mean, you hear all about all these horror stories happening. But yeah, I mean, we got your enquiry off our website that you just put through yesterday in effect for the funeral cover.
[14 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. And a after this, can we talk about life insurance things?
[14 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Now, Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we can. Now I will just let you know with your bank details, we actually pause the call recording. So it's not actually captured.
[14 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK, Good. Mm hmm.
[14 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So it's, it's for security purposes, but the call recording will stop and it will recommence after we've collected your details. So I'm just going to pause it now, but it usually. Please be advised the call recording has now resumed for quality and monitoring purposes.
[15 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Lovely.
[15 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So last step is just to read out your legal declaration which should take roughly 4 minutes for me to read with two questions at the end for you.

[21 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I can cancel at any time.
[21 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yep. You've got no luck in contract for cancellation fees.
[21 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : If anyway we were able to pay 12 monthly straight up. Are we able to do that?
[21 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So you can pay annually, You can always give us a call back and apply to change that payment frequency.
[21 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Beautiful.
[21 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. Perfect.
[21 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : That's that's right.
[21 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : I will just confirm though, would you like any other information about the insurance now or would you like me to read any part of the PDS to you, yes or no?
[21 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No, thank you.
[21 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[21 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : If I have any more questions pop up in my head, I got your number down.
[21 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Absolutely. Yep. And yeah, my contact details will be included in all your policy documents as well. So you don't hesitate to give me a call back. Now, you said you wanted to look at the life insurance as well, Is that right?
[21 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Excuse me. Yes.
[21 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's fine.
[21 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Is that OK?
[21 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : We can do that now with the life insurance. We can't do joint policies. So we would actually have to wait to speak, to speak to Paul, to organise his. Because with the health and lifestyle questions we have, legally we can't go through them with anyone other than the person we're insuring. So that's why they'd be single policy, so we'd be able to have a look at yours. And then I need to speak to Paul at a later stage if he's is available to go through heads as well. OK.
[22 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah, If we do, yeah.
[22 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, that's fine.
[22 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Well, I've got to speak to him about that one first.
[22 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely. Yep.
[22 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : There was a question when we put each other's names down, as you know, beneficiary for our funeral cover. Do we need to fill out paperwork?
[22 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So this is the only form that'll need to be filled in and sent back to us.
[22 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : I bet you you're sending it by now.
[22 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So it'll be in all your policy documents both, yeah, by e-mail and by post.
[22 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : How beautiful.
[22 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : And then you can either e-mail or post it back.
[22 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Good job account. OK.
[22 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Now Paul would his default beneficiary is going to be you. You can choose your own beneficiary.
[23 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[23 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So, but if Paul was to pass away because you're technically the policy like you're the main life and a short on this funeral 1 you you you'd be the one to receive that 15,000 payout for Paul.
[23 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[23 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Now let me stop over to the life insurance. Life insurance is similar in a way like it still pays out in the events that you were to to pass away. It would be paid out to your family, but because it's a higher benefit amount, it can help out with, you know, covering a mortgage, unpaid bills, any other large expenses may be left behind, even if it's just an extra money to your family. So have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months, Yes or no? Yep. And let me just bring up some pricing here.
[23 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Oh yes, I'm having one now.
[23 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Alright, let's have a look. Exactly. No, that's right. Now you are eligible for an amount starting at $100,000, going all the way up to $1 million.
[23 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : So it's a bit daunting, these conversations, but you have to have them, yes. Not worth that much.
[24 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Now obviously things like smoking status, age and level of coverage all going to impact the overall price. So how much coverage do you think you would need to leave behind?
[24 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, probably just that 100,000.
[24 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[24 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Just just, yeah, $32.14 fortnight. Yep.
[24 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : That would be $32.13 per fortnight and $0.13 now.
[24 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Oh my.
[24 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Do you think that would sound suitable for you or did you want to have a look at a different amount?
