[1 seconds][Agent] : Hello, welcome to Wheel Insurance. You're speaking with Kayla. How can I help you today?
[6 seconds][Customer] : You like Kayla? I was just wondering, do you also do funeral insurance?
[13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. Yeah, we do offer funeral insurance. More than happy to help you there. Is this cover going to be for you? Yeah, no problem. So what I'll do, I'll just take down a couple of your details and take you through the policy and run through some pricing just so I can do that. Can I just start?
[21 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Keith.
[31 seconds][Agent] : Firstly, what's your first name there please, Pete and oh, sorry, Keith. Sorry, my apologies for that. Thanks, Keith. And then your surname, please. Thank you. And lastly, your date of birth.
[36 seconds][Customer] : Keith Miller, NYLLER, 3rd of the 2nd 59.
[54 seconds][Agent] : Brilliant. And can I also confirm you're an Australian resident? Thank you so much for that. And just so I can help you if you know, insurance, something new or do you currently have a policy in place already?
[58 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yeah, I want to get out of other policy because it keeps going up too high.
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, I see. Gotcha.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's insurance line.
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Oh, Yep, it's good to see.
[1 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I've been in to Dallas Ford.
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Wow. Sounds very long for 25 years. Wow. I'll give you someone with us. When we generate the pricing on your insurance today, it's basically your age today at 65, but then it's not designed to go up as you get older. You're not going to have the issues where as you get older keeps going up. It's just pretty much designed to stay the same year on year.
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, it's, it's good to know you've got a funeral insurance. So you definitely see the values of having the cover there. So I'll explain exactly what I'm going to get you to do is you can choose covers from $3000 to to $15,000. Now what if you end up choosing? That's the amount that your family received to pay for your funeral. So have you thought about firstly or whether you're wanting to be cremated or whether you're wanting to be buried? Yeah, easier. That's good. Do your family know already what your wishes are going to be as well?
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, cremations easier, yeah.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : That's good. OK, beautiful. So whatever you end up choosing, that's the amount that your family received and they use the funds to pay for cremation. When someone newly applies for funeral insurance with us, for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months you will be covered for debt due to any cause. However, because you've got current cover with insurance line, there is a way. If you find that this policy sounds more suitable, I'll go through that process on how you can apply to have that 12 months waiting period. So meaning that when you're covered, you didn't have a straight away without having that 12 months waiting period for natural causes. In addition as well, there is a terminal illness benefit included, which means that after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, what you're being insured for gets paid out to you whilst you're still alive. So if you've got any medical expenses or you simply want to leave the funds behind to the family, that's entirely up to you. Now, I'll also give you a Peace of Mind that there's three benefits that come into play when you turn 85. So with your fortnightly premiums that you pay to us, you're not required to make any more payments when you turn 85. And what we also do is increase your cover automatically by including a 25% bonus cover. What we've gone through today, you can also find information about our premium structure and that's on our website. Now. Lastly, I'll explain our early cash out option for you as well. So anytime after you turn 85, you could choose to end your cover and we will pay you 75% of your funeral insurance benefit. So let's go through the information for you. Do you have any questions at all so far with regards to what I've gone through? Oh, good. Oh, that's really good to hear that. So he's given us or given you a recommendation which is us.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : My brother in law's and that and he told me how good news are compared to that one on Yep.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : That's awesome to hear. That's well tell him thank you. So what I'll do now, I'll go through some pricing. How much cover do you feel that you'd need for your cremation there?
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Well, probably, I don't know, 10,000 troops?
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, So where did you want me to start with some pricing for you $10,000? I can start there of course and we can wait work our way up or down for you if you'd need as well.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So if you're starting at $10,000 for work out to be one second, so that's $36.98 a fortnight, that's starting with $10,000 cover. And just remember that's premium is not designed to go up. It's designed to stay the same as well. But starting with $10,000 at $36.98 a fortnight kit. How does that sound? Did you want me to look at any other amount or does that sound suitable there for you?
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it sounds good.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Good. All right, beautiful. I'm to hear that as well. But what that except is provide that security there that you're after case and get you covered with us. So what we do is we distribute all the policy documents to your address and we sent out an e-mail. Now understand that you've got that existing cover. So with us you're not required to make any payment right away. We get you to choose a payment date in the future that suits you as well. What we say because you've got an existing policy with insurance line as well. If you are replacing an existing policy, we do recommend that you do not cancel it until your application has been approved and you have reviewed this policy in full. As it may not be identical to existing cover. And you should also consider the benefits that may not apply or the waiting periods that may start again as well. But just to get this organized for you as well. Moving on, what I'm going to do first, please. Do you mind if I just grab your home address there, please? Yep, just a second. Golden. Thank you.

[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Thank you, beautiful. There's just a couple of other things I wanna let you know. We offer a benefit called a real reward. So once you hit one year with our funeral insurance following your first policy anniversary date, we go ahead and refund 10% of your premiums back to you. So next year we are going to refund back to you. Just give me one moment, I'll have a look at that refund. So almost $100.00, so only $6.15 that we deposit back into your bank account for the following year for holding that cover with us for a year. With the welcome pack, we're also going to attach a free online legal will. So if you haven't organized your will yet, umm, that's gonna come through with the welcome pack as well for you. Now lastly, I just want to make you aware with our funeral insurance, it's not a savings or an investment. So you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. And please be aware this insurance not have a savings or an investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you'll not receive anything back unless you are eligible for and decide to take out the early cash option at 85. So that's the last of the information for you as well. So the next steps to move on to provide that cover for you, I'll get you to choose exactly when you want to start with your first payment. Once you choose the it's set up automatically as a direct debit as well. So when do you want to start this that would be most suitable there for you?
