[1 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'd much rather no one have to pay my stuff for me. Yeah.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I completely understand. So Kylie, the policy is designed to do that for you as well, OK. It is designed to provide a cash benefit to the to the family through a lump sum payment when you pass away. And they can use the money not just for the funeral cost though, but also if you leave behind any other final expenses such as unpaid bill, medical bills, they can also use that money to pay those expenses off. OK.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : And the cash benefit of Ma'am Carly, you can apply from $3000 goes up to $15,000. OK.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll do it. I already put in for the 15,000. That's what I wanted to do. It cost us 10.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's, yeah, I could see that you put down for 15 as well.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : It cost us 10 to do our assumption or say Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : For example, if your funeral might cost your family say $10,000, the remaining $5000, if they want, they can put up use that money to pay other expenses as well or they can put back into their savings account. Wouldn't tell them what to do with the money. It's entirely up to them, OK? And as a policy owner, kindly you can choose your own beneficiary. You can apply umm, you can nominate up to five beneficiaries in the beneficiary form.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah. Pardon me.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Umm, bless you. And they will be receiving their nominated benefit amount.
[2 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.

[3 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : We've got three different brands to compare, but having said that kindly, we don't compare all expects of products available in the market. We are a related company to Brainstorm Financial Services who distribute and administer the brands I can arrange today. Each product has different features, so it's important to consider this in combination with the price and the PDF before making a decision to purchase. OK, So kindly I put down as a $15,000 as you requested. I still coming up with the pricing. What I'll do I'll quickly run is for some of the key points. OK, One of the benefits, uh, benefits you have with the policy, regardless of which brand you go ahead with their benefits and the features exactly the same. So one of the benefit is called an accidental death benefit. It means that if you pass away due to an accidental reason, Kylie, the $15,000 will will come back to $45,000. OK.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : And the second benefit you do have is called an accidental CS injury. So the accidental CS injury means that if you were to suffer an accidental CS injury such as if you become quantaplagic or paraplagic before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, the benefit amount, it does also get triple as well, kindly. So that $15,000 will convert to $45,000 and that amount you can utilize to us through medical costs, OK. In terms of the application process, kindly we make it very nice and easy. If the policy does sounding affordable to yourself, we help you to get the policy organized for you. There are no medical checks you do have to go through the acceptance is guaranteed if you are an Australian resident and age between 40 and 79, OK.

In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were fast diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, Kylie, we're gonna pay you the $15,000 a man while you're still alive so you can utilize that money towards your medical cost to receive the best care possible. OK. But having having said that Kylie, no could not. I do hope you never have to suffer any terminal illness in your life. But just to let you know about that option. OK. Umm, So Kylie, what I'll do now? Bring up the pricing for yourself. But have you understood me clearly so far?
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. So for the $15,000 policy, one of the brand is coming slightly cost effective. There is few sensitive for any pricing. So really sure they're coming up at $224.12 a fortnight.

[6 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, perfect. And a couple of things to note Carly as well, I'll quickly run you through that. Your premiums are level, which means your premiums are designed to stay the same as you get older.
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : And you can also find information about our premium instructor on our website too. And Kylie, one of the option you have when you turn 85 that do you do have a cash out option available. So at any time after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose to end the cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefits. OK, so Kylie, with real insurance, you're also going to receive a real reward. What that means is following your first policy anniversary date, real insurance is going to refund you 10% of the premium you have paid in that time. So you'll be receiving $62.72 back after the first year. And if you haven't organized your will, real insurance is also going to send you an online legal will that is valid at $160.00, but you'll be receiving with the policy copy as a complementary free gift.
