[2 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Umm, we also have a living, got a couple of living benefits. One of them is a accidental serious injury component. So if you yourself would just suffer an accident or serious injury before your policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, I'm thinking of things such as quadriplegia or prioripage of instance.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Your benefit amount will be tripled and paid to you.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.

[3 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Only after the first 12 months, you will be covered for deaths you to any cause. And in addition for you, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness, the 12 months will actually by a medical practitioner. What we're gonna do in that case? Pay the CLA in full to you instead. Mm hmm. Now we can look between 3 and 15,000. People have lots of I ideas of what they want. Umm and our premiums are designed to stay the same for you year on year as you get older. So they'll stay the same.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : And also umm when you reach 85 they'll stop. Nothing more for you to pay but the policy is still in place there for you. OK, Yep. Also, umm, your family will get an extra 25% bonus cover applied at that time too, at no cost to you, OK.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. The last thing to let you know is when you get to 85, if you want to, you can end your cover. We'll pay back to you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit amount. OK, so that's only if you want to. You don't have to. You can keep it going. There's no cost to you and it just keeps going. Alright, let's have a look at some amounts. Do you have any questions for me and have you understood everything so far?

[4 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Good day. I'm sorry.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : My, my annuals just passed away a couple of year ago and they only, they only had, they only had the 3000 cover and it didn't cover.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Wow. Did he have a cremation or a burial?
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : I mean, he was, he was, I was saying that RSL covered some of it, but it was nowhere near enough cremation, I think.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK, Alright, well let's look at the 15,000.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : If you're looking at the 15,000, which is still 45 for your accidental death and serious injury, 45,000, your total, that's coming in at $52.77 a fortnight.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's alright.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : That one sounds OK.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : That's alright. It's it's a little bit more than double that month, ain't it?
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, let me show you monthly a moment.

[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And keep in mind that's going to stay the same.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So that's the premiums are designed to stay the same for you year on you as you get older and when you get to 85 that stops.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : And, and, and I like because one thing about the time I when you're serious, when that happens, if that that might be why they have the $3000 cover, because when you want to pension it, it's a little bit harder to afford all these things, isn't it?
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Well, if you if that time comes and that's no longer affordable for you, give us a call and you can reduce the amount of cover a little bit for yourself, OK?
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, that's that's good.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK. But keeping in mind as get as well, it's not gonna be increasing. It's designed to, the premiums are designed to stay the same for you year on year as you get older.
