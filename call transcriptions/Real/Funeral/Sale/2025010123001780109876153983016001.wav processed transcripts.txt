[4 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, at this stage, yeah. Yeah, we'll say 7.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, thank you, Thank you and please let me know if you wanted to increase or decrease. It is all about, you know, finding the wide affordability that suits your needs and also the level of cover. Colin, if you, yeah if you wishes are cremation or burial, I can also let you know some costings around those as well. But whilst that is loading up, I will just also explain that your premiums are designed to stay the same as you get older. And when you reach the age of 85, you stop paying the premiums and you automatically receive a 20, 25% bonus cover that will actually be applied to your benefit amount. And yeah, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. And you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. Colin as well, please be on there. This insurance does not have a savings on investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you'll not receive anything back unless you're eligible for and choose the early cash back offer. And just really quickly there, Colin, the early cash option means that when you and Wendy each reach the age of 85, you can actually choose to end your cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit amount. You don't have to take up the offer there, Colin, but it will be available to each of you at that point in time. And the wonderful thing about Real is we will, well, you will receive what we call as a real reward. So following your first policy anniversary date, we will refund you 10% of the premiums that you have paid in during that time. And we will also provide you with a free online and legal will valued at $160.00 of each policy. So if you haven't done your will or Wendy, that will also be coming out your way as well.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, we've, we've both got girls. They're very old. So we we benefit from that having a new welcome.
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yes, sure. That that, that will be coming your way.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Alright, so how just a couple of questions. You pay direct debit, pay direct debit. OK, Yeah, fortnightly, monthly. How's it work?
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yep, sure. So you can actually select either 4 nightly, monthly or annually. It doesn't make a difference. Whatever you choose, it works out to be exactly the same. But we can actually coincide it with your preferred pay date. So that way you don't have to stress or worry oh winter coming through and so forth.
[6 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : So there's no, there's sorry, there's no penal, no penalty for paying fortnightly or monthly.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : But we can actually do that for you now, Colin, just just to yes or annually, correct.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK, alright. OK, So yes, 'cause some places charge you extra if you wanna pay fortnightly or whatever.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Oh, no, no, thank you.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK, So what you know what's what's online, that's what I need to know. What?
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : How much say? So let's say we work at fortnightly 'cause that's I'm on the pension and it gets come straight out when the pension goes into the back Pension fortnight. Yeah. OK, so how much am I up for?
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So, Colin, perfect, we can do that for both of you, $112.53 a fortnight. So that's one.
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : For two of us, yeah, 100 and 1249.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Oh no, no, I haven't got that sort of money.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : 112.53, yeah. OK.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No, sorry.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : And Colin, can I ask? No, please don't apologize. Colin, can I ask, are your wishes, umm, you know, more cremation or burial?
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, technical information. Yeah, definitely information, both of them.
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, sure. Because I know as I mentioned that you have some, you know, funeral facts. So according to the government's Money Smart website, private funerals typically cost somewhere in the region of $4000 for a basic cremation, up to $15,000 for a more detailed burial service. So therefore not as much as needed.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : And let's take a look for example, at a $5000 level of cover for you and for Wendy, again, because you're you're looking at the cremation, you know that is in the region of $4000 for a basic cremation. If we look at $5000 each column this time you're looking at $80.38 per fortnight.
[8 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Now keep in mind as well that that bonus cover when you each reach age of 85 will be $1250. That will actually be added to the $5000. So you'll actually be covered for 6000, $250. Once you do reach the age of 85, you stop paying the premiums. The policy will continue to provide you with that protection. And even if you're travelling overseas, Colin, you're protected as a overseas all around the world with our policy. And then let's say you and I do wish you both a long and healthy life. Let's say you reach A-100, the age of 100. Then what we will do is provide you with the full benefit amount plus that bonus cover on your 100th birthday as a here you go happy birthday and we actually pay that all out to you.
[9 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : OK, see what, what other questions do I have? That's, that's, that's more near the mark. I, I got a $480 a four nine. That's OK.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Sure, sorry, that is absolutely beautiful.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : That's so if anything happens to the first 12 months, I'll still get nothing. That's that's what I'm saying. Is that what I what I say?
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Ah, but but Colin, if you pass away to the natural courses, that is correct. But you, you both you and Wendy straight away are covered if there was an accident and the benefit amount will actually triple where that $5000 will actually become $15,000 so up to $15,000 payable. Again, you both are covered straight away for the accidental death, the net death due to any natural causes that is after the first 12 months. That is correct. But that's why I was asking if there's any concerns there with Wendy or yourself.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK.
[10 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : But you know, and again as well, how quickly does a whole year does, do you know, does fly beautiful and fantastic.
[10 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Do you O do you offer anything like there's a couple of wouldn't offer for gift gift cards.
[10 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So we don't have gift cards, we don't have gift cards, but Colin with a real reward. So and we are looking at the $5000 for you and Wendy, that real reward actually will be $208.99 that will actually be re refunded back to you. It's it's called a re a real reward again, that is the 10% of the premium. So you have paid in during that time that will be coming back to you. So the following your first policy anniversary date.
[11 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK, so we're looking at $80.00 and so many cents per month, right?
[11 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So that is the real reward that you and Wendy will receive to fortnight.
[11 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Oh, sorry, per fortnight. Yeah.
[11 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that is correct.
[11 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : And that covers both offers for $5000 coverage, right?
[11 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : That that is correct.
[11 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Accidental death. We could triple that. I'm just going to understand, actually understand.
[11 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yes, yes, sure.
[11 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : So there's no other hidden costs or you're not going to ask how much you're not going to bum a price up as as that that price is from now to forever. It's not gonna go up with any because inflation goes up 5%. It's not gonna go up 5% next year or.
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So though, so in in regards now inflation that does change from year to year and I do understand that, you know that does O occur sometimes in, in regards to that, but I will just explain Colin. So the premium you pay is set at the commencement date and it's designed not to increase every year based on your age. Now, as you were just mentioning, we may increase the premium rates applying to your policy, but only if we change the premium rates applying to all the Real Funeral insurance policy owners. Now, we will send written notice of any changes to you at least 3090 days before the effective date of change. But I will let you know, Colin, since introducing this product, the Real Funeral Cover that no prices have gone in or increased at all. So I can let you know that as well.
[12 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[12 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : But mm, hmm, yeah.
[12 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : My only concern now is, is that first four months, if something happens to one of us, we get nothing, absolutely nothing. You haven't got any sort of policy where you you get a percentage of a 5000 even just or nothing like that.
[12 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : The not, not, you know, in the first four months, but but again, not the percentage, but honestly, again, we're we're saying happy New Year and.
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah.
[13 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : And it's amazing how quickly, you know, Christmas came around. Yeah, if you're both healthy, sorry, healthy and there's no concerns. I mean, yeah, again, it it truly is amazing how quickly 12 months does fly by. But let's see and call if you're liking the benefits, the features and the costing. So what I'm able to do for you today is get you both covered over the phone immediately send you all the policy documents so you can sit down, review and even share with you and Colin. This policy gives you a 30 day cooling off. If you decide this policy is not suitable for you and cancel within the 30 days, then you will receive a full refund of your premiums unless the plan has been made. And that way you're both covered from today. Don't need even pay for anything at all today, as you mentioned to me that you have a pension date, we can actually coincide it with that pension date.
