[3 seconds][Agent] : Welcome to Real Insurance. You're speaking with Ken. How can I help?
[6 seconds][Customer] : Yes, my name is Ron Lawrence. I had a missed call from you guys. Yeah, I did.
[6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no worries. Thanks for calling back. Let me find out why you got the call.
[15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I did. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13 seconds][Agent] : Could be because you've made an enquiry into insurance and my colleague has been trying to follow up. Ron, can I just get to confirm your surname and date of birth please?
[22 seconds][Customer] : The surname is Lawrence Lawrence. Date of birth is the 17th of June 1957.
[29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, thank you. And Please note calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general nature and it'll be suitable to your situation. Let's have a look. Yeah, thanks for calling back. Ron. The reason for the call is actually you've made an enquiry into the funeral insurance. So that was the reason for the call. So thanks for making that enquiry. So I'll go through the main features and Ron, we'll have a look at some pricing. Any questions? So let me know what's prompted you to look into funeral insurance.
[57 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I haven't got it and got 6067 now.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, no worries at all. So your age account just sparked that interest. Is it something that you've looked into before or is it all quite new?
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Before I didn't, I saw it out on TV, so yeah, I wasn't telling it before we.
[1 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fair enough. No, that's fine. Well, well, it is a like you probably see on the TV later on. This is a cash benefit that we will be paying to your loved ones when you pass away. They can use the funds not only for funeral expenses, but also any other final expenses like unpaid bills. You can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this nominated benefit amount. Currently, WH, who would you be looking to lead this payout to?
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : They were looking to get it too.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, like who who you're looking to leave this payout to, to take care of those funeral expenses.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Probably my daughter. She didn't get it on me as well so.
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Oh, right. OK, all good. Well, well, you can just select her to be the beneficiary. So it's it's that's about nice and easily. So in the event of claims, you can just call our our clients team in order to make that climb. And now if death is due to an accident, we will be tripling that payout for your daughter. And if these apply, there are no medical checks. If you're on Australia resident age 2040 and 79, acceptance is guaranteed. If you were to suffer an accidental serious injuries such as quadriplegia or paraplegia before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, the benefit amount will also triple. And just so you know, Ron, for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental deaths, an accidental serious injury only. But after the first 12 months you will be covered for deaths due to any cause. In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, meaning after holding your policy for 12 months, if you're first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months, well that's delivered by a medical practitioner, we'll pay your claim in full. So that could help you with things like medical expenses. Do you have any questions for me so far or is that all sounding pretty straightforward? Yeah.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm pretty right. I've got probably health insurance.
[3 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, lovely. Yeah, that's good. So now on that, you would have seen $3000 to $15,000 is the range that you can look into. Was there an amount there you have in mind that you'd like me to get your price on?
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, probably the 15 inches lately.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure.
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No, My, my parent, my mother's, my dad's funeral months and only about, I don't know, years ago and you know, it's six hours for the coffin. Got a, got a brand for the cremation, all the bits and pieces. So have you that would have gone up by now.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I can understand it. It can all add up like what you just mentioned there, all these different components that make pick up the total cost. Did your parents have funeral insurance cover or is this something that the family, you know, pitched in to pay for those expenses? Oh, right.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Well now they, they, they've paid their own, they sort of pitch, they've sort of all they, they had it all sort of sort sorted out years before that.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, alright. Yeah. So that kind of helped out the family. And yeah, you know, according to the government's Money Smart website, private funerals typically cost some the regional $4000 for a basic cremation up to $15,000 or a more detailed burial soon. So generally promotions cost less than the burial option. But have you thought that far ahead as to what you feel that you prefer?
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yes, of course. The promotion.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, no worries. So at least that might just give you an idea of how much it is. And you know, you just let your daughter know as to what your wishes are so when she receives that pay up, she can use it to pay for those cremation related costs. So I'll just get you that price for the $15,000 amount. Just also confirming that you are an Australian resident. Yep. All right, thank you. So 15,000, so this will be a $45,000 payout if death was due to an accident.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So just one moment while I get this price there's. How's your morning been, by the way?
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Pardon.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : How's your morning done?
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Well, yeah, I just, I just wanted to get the shopping and now I'm going to hit the end of Bunnings and get some stuff.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah, All right, nice, nice. Any, any particular project or just something that you need to All right.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : I just cleaning that, cleaning some bushes and things.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Oh, nice. Now with $15,000 sixty $1.81 a fortnight. Does that sound affordable? Or is there another amount you'd like to have a look at?
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : No, no, there'll be a lot.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, good. And there's a real reward attached as well. So following your first policy anniversary date, we will refund 10% of the premise that you've paid at time $160.80. OK $160.71 will be your refund under the reward. So just keep that in mind. It's sort of like our way of saying sales can cover a year. We give some money back to you.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Just also just like to make aware you may pay more in total premiums over the loss of policy than the benefit amount. Please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of 30 days, your cover will stop and you'll not receive anything back unless you're eligible for Tuesday early cash back offer, which I'll touch on a little later. Your premiums are designed to stay as saying. You can also find information about our Prem structure on our website. When you reach the age of 85 Ron, your premise will see. So you have nothing more to pay and you will also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover, which applied to $15,000 is a bonus $3750 cover. So a little bit more to leave to your 85. When you reach 8085, that's when you stopped paying for premise. You'll still be covered that early cash out option. At any time after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover and we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. So it's simply an option when you reach that age or you just keep going and get that 25% bonus. Now, Ron, if you're happy with that, I'll get you covered. I'll get you. I'll get all those documents posted to your address. So once you receive these documents, you can select your daughter to be the beneficiary. Any questions, please call us. Our contact details will be on the documents.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : This policy also gives you a 30 day cooling off. Just in case you change your mind. You're not required to pay anything today, Ron. You select your preferred method of payment and select the payment date of your choice so you can actually push it out to a date that you prefer. We'll get you on launch payday if you like. Are you happy to continue? All right. Thank you. Today is Monday, 6th of January. What day would you prefer for that first payment?
