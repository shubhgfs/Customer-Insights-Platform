So while you're covered, you can sit down and go through everything in the comfort of your own home. And obviously, uh, all you need to do on your end is fill out the beneficiaries form, sign that and send it back. OK, now, even though we're gonna cover you from today, we let you choose when you want the first payment to come out. So this way you're not paying anything straight away.

If you take it out today and let's say tomorrow you pass in a car accident or heart attack, for example, touch it, you're gonna be cut through those kind of things straight away. Now, uh, there's a terminally ill advanced payment included as well. So hopefully you never have to use this, but what it means that at any time and hold the policy, if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then obviously in this, in this case, we'll pay out 100% of the life insurance benefit amount to while you're alive. OK. And uh, with the premium, there's one more thing you might notice already, but your premium is stepped, which is it will generally increase each year.
