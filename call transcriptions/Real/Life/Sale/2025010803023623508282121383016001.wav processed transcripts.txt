[1 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[3 seconds][Agent] : Good afternoon Kelly, it's Cameron calling you from Mill Insurance. Kelly, I've received the request on the website for a quote and some information on their life cover. I can see you've just popped that through a moment ago. Thanks so much for the enquiry. Obviously you've grabbed this at a good time because I'm able to go through that with you, see if there's something that might be suitable to your needs.
[11 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Right.
[21 seconds][Agent] : If you don't mind me starting by confirming the details you've shared through your first. Name's Kelly with an I surname Miller. And your date of birth is the 24th of March 1973, is that right?
[26 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes, that's correct.
[33 seconds][Agent] : And Kelly, of course, you're a female and also an Australian resident, correct?
[37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[38 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Letting you know calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general in nature and maybe not may not be suitable to your situation. Umm Kelly, I specialize in my life and income protection insurance so I had no idea through how it all works, but just starting with an understanding of your situation. Umm, I find it really helps to get a better sense of what your needs are, what you're looking for and and how we can help. So tell me a bit about yourself. What what's got you looking? What do you need?
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Oh, well, I'm, I'm Fif. I'm 52 ro 52 years old this year.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : 52 years young? Gotcha.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : I've yeah, I I'll be 52 in March.
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Oh, coming up close and I've got a 27 year old daughter. She's got her own family, but I've got nothing put away if like no sort of saving, like not enough saving put away to sort of cover me if anything does sort of happen or you know, and tearing a partner sort of couldn't afford too much either type thing, you know, and I want to, I've, I've been tossing out there's a gap between a funeral fund or a life insurance. I I don't, I don't really know.
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, OK, OK, so let me recap, see if I've got this right. Kelly, you've got a, a daughter, 27.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : I've got 2 granddaughters. Yes, Yep, yes, that's, that's correct. Yes, that's correct. Yes.
[1 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : She's got her own family by the way, grandkids, beautiful couple of grandkiddies and you're worried about the future if something happens to you that you don't really have much savings behind you and neither does your daughter in you worried about like those final costs and making sure that there's no financial burden left on yo your daughter is that have I understood the rights of it got you OK. And so therefore, you're not quite sure what makes the most sense, a life or a funeral cover, but you you sort of got it. Yep. OK, thanks so much for explaining. That makes sense to me based on what you told me. I can go through both, just for the record. But with the life insurance, it does have a funeral component in it.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, exactly right, right.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : And if you look at dollar for dollar value as if you look, So if you compare the $1000 of life insurance versus $1000 of funeral insurance, life insurance typically, not always, but typically it's the cheaper per unit.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : But that, that's what I'm leaning more towards is the life insurance.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, so sure. But there are some differences. So I'm happy to explain them both just to make sure you're aware of how it works. But why don't we start with a life insurance, Sir?
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : I think having a funeral insurance, yes, right.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : The the other thing, the other key differences, Kelly, is life insurance usually lets you insure yourself for a larger sum of money. So we'd ask, it's anywhere from $100,000 up to the highest sum that you're eligible for. And if you're 51 currently, that's gonna be $1,000,000 by the looks of it. So you can look anywhere between those ranges going up and down any increments of $50,000. It is subject, however, to your eligibility. So we need to take you through some lifestyle questions and uh, assuming that you are then fully approved, we can then obviously commence the cover. But sometimes people aren't eligible, Kelly, based on their health circumstances, in which case we can still fall back on the funeral entrance and look what, uh, what that looks like for you.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Right, right.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, Hopefully that sort of gives you an overview.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yes, it does.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Any questions so far?
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[4 minutes][Agent] : OK, OK, great. Well, let's start by going through the the life cover. Let's see if that's suitable first. And as I said, if it's not with the funeral cover, instead, I need to know your smoking status. Please. Kelly, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? OK, I'm going to be straightforward with you. That's going to make it more expensive.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I have, right?
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : However, you can always get it checked any stage in the future. So let's say we put the cover in place today and down the line you give it up and you want to get it reviewed, give us a call. Our support team can always re review your your policy circumstances.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, right.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, But today let's have a look at what it looks like with that as a smoker status. Now with the amount of cover, tell me about your worries 'cause I can see the inquiry popped in was $400,000 so far.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, to be honest, I've got no idea how much to be covered for.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure, sure. And, and, and I'll be, I'll be upfront, I'm not a financial advisor. I'm not going to give you any personal advice on what you should expect. That's up to you. What I'll do is I'll give you some costs, I'll give you the same cover and you can figure out whatever is best for you at the moment. But so far everything you've told me sort of you were talking about like final costs that you're passing and not leaving any burdens on your, your daughter.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Do you know what those costs are going to look like? For example, I, I know this is a weird, morbid conversation, but have you looked at some of the costs involved in, in your passing or what you would want done with your, your body, for example?
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, well promotion, you know, Popu popular service and information.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : And OK, OK. Oh, I'm so sorry.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : My my mother passed away a couple of years ago and the cost my sister and I about 14,000 at the time.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, so about 14,000 that seems pretty consistent with what I hear from a lot of people these days is around that sort of $15,000 mark.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, Cos my mother had a funeral insurance cover so that's what paid for hers.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep. So the funeral insurance can cover you from anywhere as low as $3000, a personal $15,000.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : The life insurance starts as a minimum of $100,000. So that well and truly cover off any of those upfront concerns, plus anything, anything else you might have in the background. So do you have, for example, do you have personal loans or a mortgage or anything else you'd be worried about? Kelly?
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : I've got no mortgage, but I've got a couple of personal lines. Yes.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK. And you don't have to tell me how much, but is $100,000 going to effectively cover that for you? OK. Yeah, OK.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Oh well, I'm truly yes, yes, I'm just yeah, not much at all tha that would diff before I cover it.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK. So in other words, Kelly, if we loaded up $100,000 and looked at the cost, assuming the cost works for you, would $100,000 fit the brief for you? Is it gonna give you the Peace of Mind that Y your daughter's gonna have that measure of protection?
[6 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, definitely, yes.
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, well let's use that as a launchpad, if you're happy to, I mean, because I can see the, the reason why I'm asking, sorry Kelly, is the originally the enquiry popped through was for 400,000. So I'm just trying to understand if there was something else that we need to, to factor in here.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Like why did you select 400,000?
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : No, I I don't think so. Just to just to make sure that my daughter's gonna be gonna be fine. You know what I mean? Money wise as well.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Sure, sure, sure.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : So I mean, what we can do if, if you, if you're thinking in your head or maybe a little bit extra might help my daughter out, we can start at the 100,000, look at that cost and then look at the next level up and, and see if there's something that fits better. That's no problems.
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : There's no, I mean, we can go through any number of options. You need me to Kelly to find them. If you want me to start at the 400, I'm happy to do that.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : No.
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : If you want me to start at the 100, just let me know.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah. The 100, I think, yeah.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'm gonna load that up now just in in respect to what you're actually covered for. As I've mentioned, there isn't a a funeral consideration built into the life policy.
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : What?
[7 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So what that means is we provide an advanced payment of 20% of the benefit amount up to a maximum of $20,000 to help your daughter with any of those upfront costs. And that's paid out generally within the business day on a receipt of a filled in claims form in the supporting documents. Now our claim seems here on site with us. Kelly, they're gonna, so you know, I'm in, I'm in Sydney, I don't, I think you're in Queensland, right.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : OK, that's fine. Yeah.
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So we're all based in Sydney, NSW. But our our claim seems here on site with us and our guide your daughter through that process of filling out the claims form, gathering the relevant documents to make it as easy as possible for her. And then once that once that's clated, we'll generally make that advance payment within one day.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. Right.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK Idea of that is just to immediately alleviate any financial pressure she's facing. OK. So we don't want to leave that burden on your family. We don't want to get it to to your loved ones as quickly as possible.
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : The other thing that's included in the cover is an advanced payment for a terminal illness. So terminally ill advanced payout that's available. It's subject to the health master question, so I'll give you a clarification on exactly what it covers. What we've got you approved. Umm, but it's, it's included in the cover as an extra Peace of Mind for you, hopefully, umm, something you never need to worry about.
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[9 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Of course, umm, who want, who wants a terminal diagnosis, right?
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I do. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Yeah.
[9 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Uh, but, uh, Peace of Mind that it's also in the cover for you. OK.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep.
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Now with respect to the cost, the, the factors that determine the cost really your age, your gender, the smoking status that we've already said, the smoking, the answer amount, it will also be verified by the helpful lifestyle question. So these costs at the moment are just indicative so that you've got a frame of reference and then we'll run through those questions as well. OK. So $100,000 per fortnight is gonna cost you, Kelly, $23.08.
[9 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK, right, right, OK.
[9 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Now the cost structure's linear. And what I mean by that is as you double the amount, you will double the cost. So at $200,000, you can expect to pay twice that and it's $26.15.
[10 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : And obviously we can go in between $150,000, which would work out to be $34.61. OK.
[10 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Well, that's, that's that's fortnightly.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : These are fortnight it costs. Yeah, I obviously I don't know your financial listen, Kelly, so you'll have to guide me here. Are any of these amounts sounding like they might fit into a budget for you?
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yes, they yes, definitely, yes.
[10 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[10 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : I mean like even 100,000 or even 150,000, yeah.
[10 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, So the 100 or 150 whi which one do you think is gonna be the better option at this stage?
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Probably the probably the 100,000.
[10 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Yeah, that's kind of survive. Great. The other thing I just want to make clear for you is it's a stepped premium, Kelly, meaning it's going to increase generally speaking each year.
[10 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : I think I'll Yeah, yeah, Uh huh.
[11 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : In addition, the policy has what's called automatic indexation, which means that following your first, sorry, I didn't say that right, I beg your pardon. Each year when we send out renewal forms, the sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. OK, so it it carries on until you reach the maximum benefit amount or until the policy anniversary following is 70 to his birthday. But you can opt out of this automatic indication each if you'd like to.
[11 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh, right?
[11 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : So it's not mandatory. We leave that choice in your hand when we send out the renewal forms each year. You've got that choice. Now I'm gonna give you an example just to make it nice and clear for you. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium in the next year will be $27.03 with your benefit rising to $105,000. You don't want to see that rise and you want to leave the benefit amount, the 100,000, just fine. You can leave it at $100,000 and as a result your premiums will work out to be a bit cheaper, but they are still going to generally increase each year as you age.
[11 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. Yep.
[11 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, makes sense.
[12 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yes it does.
[12 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Great. Now, for your own knowledge, Kelly can always find for them for the data premium instruction website if you need that. But if you're thinking that the $100,000 at $23.08 a fortnight is gonna suit for the moment, let's get you confirmed. So we know that we can offer the cover to you. So I'm gonna load a an application and take you through that. Now before I do, Kelly, I just want to confirm some address details so that we can shoot everything out to you once we're finished talking. Do you get your mail sent to your home address?
[12 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, I do 4301.
[12 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : What's the post code, please, and what will that be mean? Your suburb site. Thank you. And the street name and number, please. Kelly. Yep.
[12 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, Redbank Unit 135A Brisbane Rd. Redbank.
[12 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Sandy. And then you're ready to have an e-mail. I'll just confirm that one for you.

[14 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Sir. Yep.
[14 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Now, with the questions, almost all of these are yes and Nos. They do have multiple parts. So what I'm gonna do is read the full question in its entirety. And then at the end, I'll simply get you to answer either yes or no to the question to the full question. If you're unsure at any stage, just let me know. Kelly. I'll, I'll give you more information if you need it.

So please be aware that I'm required to obtain a confident single bigger measurement for each in order to continue with the application. The system doesn't allow me to enter any approximate figures, words or height and weight ranges. I can note down your height, neither feet, minces or in centimeters, whatever you feel more confident with. OK, so what's your exact height, please, Kevin?
[15 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : No, 175 centimetres, I think.
[16 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK, so when you were last measured, you were 175 centimeters. Yep, that's all we need. And what is your exact weight, please?
[16 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yes, my weight.

[18 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, no thank you.
[19 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Sorry. I'm I could just feel myself starting to fade away there. Next one just says, other than what you already told me about in the past three years, have you saw medical advice or treatments by a medical practitioner or specialist? Or are you awaiting results for any medical tests or investigations such as, but not limited to any surgeries, X-ray scans, blood tests or biopsy? And other than what you've got to do out, are you contemplating seeking medical advice for any symptoms you are currently experiencing within the next two weeks? Excellent. Kelly, we're three questions away from the end you. As I said, you're doing really well. The next two are directed towards your immediate family. So father, mother, brother or sister, not referring to any other family members. And the first question asks, to the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family, living or deceased ever been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, Huntington's families or familial adenoitis, polyposis? To the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family suffered from cancer, heart condition, stroke or other hereditary disease prior to age 60? And last question, Kelly. And then we're done. This one's hazardous pursuits. So by any chance, are you a bit of a daredevil? Do you like to jump out of planes or climb torn buildings or go go racing?
[19 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not particularly.
[20 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK.

[20 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : We should pretty. It'd be pretty safe here, Kel. So it says other than one other than one off events give stupid to vouchers. Do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fairpoint passenger on a recognized airline? Motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, AB sailing, scuba diving deeper than 40 meters? Cabaret diving? Bringing out a hazardous activity?
[21 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No, none of them.
[21 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Hell no.
[21 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : No, that's a big, big hell no. Yeah, exactly.
[21 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : For me, that's a hard no good stuff. So Kelly A, as I said, you've done really well. You've gone through that, the application I think without any problems whatsoever. I can't think of anything we got stuck on. Yeah, it's been a full approval. So congratulations, that's fully approved.
[21 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Oh, thank you.
[21 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : We're looking at $23.08 a fortnight for the $100,000 of cover. Now we've got that approval in place. I just want to clarify those terms and conditions that I was mentioning before about the terminal illness. So the terminally ill advanced payment, it means that if you're diagnosed for 24 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, that's where we're able to pay out the claim in full. Knocking on wood, hopefully never. But when that time comes, if that time comes, we're able, we're able to pay out the full claim to you directly, help you with any medical costs you have and hopefully give you the best fighting chance of overcoming your diagnosis. We'd be cover itself once you accept the policy. Now we've got approval. Once you accept the policy you're immediately covered. You don't need to wait any waiting periods. You're immediately covered. Yes, due to any calls except for suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[21 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, OK. Right.
[22 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK now the next step, assuming you're happy with everything. So just double checking you're happy with 100 thousandths as the cover.
[22 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, I, I think so. Yeah, yeah.
[22 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK, so so in getting this started, Kelly, we don't need you to make a payment upfront. What we do instead is get you to nominate your own first payment date. You can select any date in the next 30 that works best for you. As an example, line it up to the pay or the pension cycle and it'll also give you time to receive the documents, give them a once over and make sure you're happy with everything.
[22 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Oh, wonderful.
[22 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So we send out the documents within 5 working days, an e-mail copy within the hour. Assuming you're happy with everything, you don't need to do anything further. When that first payment date arrives, we'll simply make the first deduction for you.
[22 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Right now, once I read these documents, do I just give my my bank details through the documents or or?
[22 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, No, WH what we do, Kelly, is we confirm them straight over the phone. So the next step is to confirm a first payment that you're happy with, a method of payment. I'll read you a declaration statement just to verify your acceptance. If you are happy and you accepted, you'll then straight away be protected. All right, So you don't need to wait till that first payment that could be covered. You're straight away protected.
[23 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[23 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : We send the documents out to you in the post and the e-mail. Make sure you're happy with everything. Assuming you are.
