[34 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[34 seconds][Agent] : Any advice we do provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation and with yourself there anything. Is this the first time you're looking at getting life insurance or do you already have something in place?
[46 seconds][Customer] : No, listen, what's happened is I've had life insurance and premiums and paid them in my super quite a while ago. And then my company that I had that super with got bought out and they had a different business super. But I left the original Superfund and started paying for income protection, total disability and life insurance. And now I've moved to more of a self managed Superfund and I've actually transferred my super across to a new Superfund which where I'm covered for the insurances under what's the word or whatever under the business plan that we're under, as you probably understand. But that happens quite a lot. The problem is, is that it seems to be that I'm in that in between. Right now where my previous insurance has closed and the premiums have stopped and I don't have insurance and the new fund is three to five business days away from actually receiving the money. And so I have no insurances with them. So my actual concern is, is I'm just looking to get a life insurance to cover me in the gap in case something happens for my family. So do you know what I mean? So it's going to be a week mate. I, I'm looking for a premium for a week of life insurance really, to tell you the truth. That's it.

If however they have a relapse or symptoms worsen and treatment needs to be changed or increased, then this constitutes the second episode.
