[18 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, thanks for appreciate your patience so far, bud.
[18 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Thanks. Bye.
[18 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So one second, OK, here we go. Yes, I put the great news there, but you've been fully approved for the life insurance.
[19 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep. Yep.
[18 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : And the other great news is that there was no changes to the premiums that we quoted earlier because it does show that you're in general good health based on the outcome of your application.
[19 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[19 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : And there was no other exclusions as well.
[19 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[19 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So what that basically means Paul, is that given that you've been approved, this policy will cover you for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months, which basically means there's no waiting period for death through the natural causes or accidental death for you. OK?
[19 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep. Yep.
[19 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Now then on your advance payment, how that works is that if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we would actually pay you that $1 million to yourself whilst you're still alive and living, OK?
[19 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep. OK, cool.
[19 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : And you may well be aware of this poor that with the premiums, let me know that your premium messed up, which means it would generally increase each year, OK.
[19 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[19 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : And you know who you asked before if we offer other $1,000,000. So at this stage we don't based on the details you provided. However, I'm not sure if you're aware of this before that with your premiums increase each year, your level of cover actually increases by 5% each year as well. OK. So to give you an example, it shows you that as an indication. So in addition, this policy has automatic indication which means each your sum insured.
[20 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK Yep, Yep.
[20 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Will increase by 5% with associative increases in premium until you reach the maximum benefit amount or until the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday.
[20 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[20 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Now, if maybe poor, you cannot be able to do schematic indexation each year. So as an indication, if you make no change to the policy, your premium next year will be $157.06 per fortnight. However, your level of cover poor would have been increased to $1,050,000. OK.
[20 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Right. OK Yep. Yep.
[20 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : And then the Mixi it'll it'll increase by another 5% in addition to that 1,000,000 to $50,000 and so on. So over the coming years it now it will keep increasing unless you opt out of it of course.
[20 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[20 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So over a certain period of time you may well reach over that $2,000,000 in in in total anyway, if that makes sense. OK.
[21 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, Yes.
[21 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Now if you need to, of course, you can also find information about our pre instruction, our website port.
[21 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[21 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Well, look, yeah, that you've been approved there, Paul, like I mentioned before, we do have a, a process available here for you that basically, you know, what we can do is actually get yourself covered.
