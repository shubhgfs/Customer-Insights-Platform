[1 minutes][Agent] : That's really good to hear.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : I'm going to bring up the, our, our life, but rather than the term life insurance because term life insurance is designed for, for, umm, that can't get full life insurance.
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, bye.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So what I'll do, the payout is different with, uh, our what real life insurance where it's from, uh, $100,000 all the way up to $750,000 cover.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Go ahead.
[1 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Whereas with term life insurance is from $10,000 up to $100,000 cover. So it's a bit of a difference there.
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[1 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So it's pretty much designed term life insurance got a higher acceptance from designed for people that can't get out ordinary life insurance.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So I'll just go through the real life cover, see how we go, umm, and then, umm, if we need to, we can go on to term life insurance if we need to as well. But umm, just to get a better understanding from you what? What's prompted you to start looking at some life insurance first and foremost for yourself?
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes. For myself, uh, getting older, I want to make some arrangements for the family just in case, you know, something unexpected happened.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. What's it here?
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : So that's the main reason behind that.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Understanding Your what? Family. So it's nice to hear that. So do you have children, A partner or wife? Yeah.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yeah, I have, uh, children and a wife.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : How many children do you have? Sisters.
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : 22 boys.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : For most, two boys are good. Oh, good, good stuff. And with life insurance, what it's all about, it's designed to provide that financial security for through a lump sum payment when you pass away. So, you know, when they TR retrieve the funds from the life insurance, they they can use those funds to maintain their lifestyle, you know, pay any, umm, outstanding debt.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Mm Hmm. Not yet. Not yet.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Are your grandfather yet safe actually in the future?
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : I'm hoping in a few years. OK.
[3 minutes][Agent] : That'd be nice, yeah. Let's say if you ever become a grandfather in the future, you know, and they decide to have children, they can use those funds also to their families as well.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So it just basically gives you that Peace of Mind if something was to happen to you, the family would have that financial security. I'll explain what's all automatically included in your life insurance as well.

[3 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Life insurance can be there to help cover those costs.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh. Uh huh.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : The reason I say that we include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount, that's to a maximum of $20,000 to help with funeral costs or any other immediate expenses that might.
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh.
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So this is a living benefit which I'll go over that benefit once we umm, discover what type of life insurance we're able to offer you today.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Right, that's one question.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Also what I mean yeah.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Does it cover like critical illness when you let's say it's just, uh, in case or something happens like I get something, it's it's common this case cancer, right. So does it cover life insurance? Yeah, OK. That's that. That's what I wanted to know that that's it.
