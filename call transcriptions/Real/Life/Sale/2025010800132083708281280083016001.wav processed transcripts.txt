[23 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Pretty simple.
[23 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[23 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : All right, Actually, no, I missed it. It's under Chameleon slash kayaking software there.
[23 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : There you go.
[23 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : I'll just put it.
[23 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[23 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I'll put it down. So you're safe? Umm, is that all?
[23 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[23 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Cool. Umm, all right, so it doesn't make a change for any of those. And in that regards, Mark, we've been able to give you a full approval man, so well done. That's the outcome we can hope for. OK.
[23 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[24 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Umm, I know I've asked you this and we went through it thoroughly and I'm happy with the way that you've told me and answered it and it's all fine. But just to reconfirm for the call, uh, at this current time, we're having a chat. Are you a male Australian resident? Yes or no?
[24 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[24 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, easy, mate. All right, let's come back and have a look at what you're actually entitled to be covered for and some pricing.
[24 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[24 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So based on your outcome, you have been approved and this policy will cover you if you get through to any cause except the suicide in the 1st 13 months. That will be worldwide coverage 24/7 as well.
[24 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK, sure.
[24 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So as long as you pay the premiums on time in Australian dollars from an Australian bank account, determine the ill advanced payment included in the cover will start immediately as well. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, you can actually call yourself, make the claim and whatever you're covered for will be paid out to yourself in full. The cover will finish at that time. But then you just get to go spend that money with complete freedom to, you know, live the life as best you can. OK. Umm, The third benefit already went through at the start, which is the funeral advance payment. Umm, that's a 20% advance payment of your benefit. You choose up to a maximum of 20 grand. So keep that in mind. That's actually generally released fairly quick, umm, within 24 to 48 business hours generally, uh, provided that your beneficiary supply the correct documents when they claim up. We don't need a death certificate for that part. So I'm proof by a professional will be suffice.
[25 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[25 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, now you are able to look between 100,000 up to 1,000,000 and I can go in the middle of that in 50,000. So how much cover do you want to look at?
[25 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : What do you reckon? I'm just talking my wife here. I think 500 too.
[25 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : I'll teach you how to change it anyway in a minute.
[25 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : It's only just to clear them the yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : It's pretty flexible.
[25 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[25 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So whatever you do here, it's just to get a start on Yeah.
[25 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Well, probably sort of depends on the premium more than the the do you know, like, do you know what I mean? Like if it's, if it's the premium's not too bad, we'll take it. Show away.
[25 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Do you want me to check? Do you want me to check 501st to see what it says?
[26 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[26 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[26 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Just check. Fine. Management.
[26 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Alright, 106 dollars and $0.90 per fortnight. That'll give you the 500,000.
[26 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's fine.
[26 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Do you want to look at any other figures?
[26 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : No, what's the time for me?
[26 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Cool, no worries.
[26 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : That's fine, Yeah.
[26 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Umm Now, as I mentioned, I'd like to just teach you a few things mate. Umm, I'm sure you'll be on top of it, but just so you know what you can do so because it is pretty flexible, there's some things that are subject to eligibility. So you can apply the decrease you're covered at any time. You don't need to get approved for that.
[26 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[26 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : If you call, if you call and apply the decrease, you cover your payments lower accordingly. Umm, as an example, if this is to cover a mortgage mate and you're chipping away your mortgage, you might not need that much later.
[26 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[26 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So you might want to keep on top of it and on top of the premiums, you guys, you can do that. Umm, you can apply to increase, OK.
[26 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm, hmm.
[27 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Umm, you can apply for this coverage between 18 to 74 for an Australian resident and that goes for increasing as well. Umm, So you do call back and you know, you say, hey, I've already got this, but I just want to look and see if I can do a bit more.
[27 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[27 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : You just need to get reapproved for your health questions again before you turn 75.
[27 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Sure. Yeah.
[27 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Umm, obviously it will depend on what age you are for, how high, how much higher you can go.
[27 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I understand.
[27 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : But you can ask to yeah, you can ask to get reapproved again and then look back at your range and pick and choose what you want to increase to umm, You need to be an Australian resident when you're doing that.
[27 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : OK. Right. OK.
[27 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, so you need to be in Australia, OK, Umm, now the increases as well. So your premium is step, which means it will generally increase each year. OK Uh, also when you're checking the renewals, please look for the automatic indexation included on the policy.
[27 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[27 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Umm, are you familiar with that term? You ever heard of that? You have, of course. So with us, the automatic indexation just means that she is sum insured.
[27 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : It's going to increase by 5% more than what it was, OK. There'll be an associated increase in your premium if you let that happen until you reach the maximum benefit amount or until the policy anniversary after your 75th birthday, whichever happens 1st, and then it will stop.
[28 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. Yeah, OK.
[28 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but the beauty about it is when you're rating your renewals, if you don't want the extra cover that year, you don't need to have it there unless you want it So you can actually call up and apply opt out of the automatic indexation each year regardless, OK Uh, of course, if you're opting house and you're leaving your benefit as it was the year before, you're not going to get that associated increase in the premium that year. Umm, you'll only just get the general increase for the step premium instead.
[28 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[28 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, uh, I wanna give you an example on that too.
[28 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[28 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So 10690 is this year for a fortnight for 500 grand. It just says Mark Fuller. Please be aware that all of our premium projections are indicative only and assume that you do not make any amendments to your cover. So as an example, if you do not decline indexation on your policy, the premium payable in your following year of cover will increase to $126.12 a fortnight. Your benefit amount will then increase to $525,000 of cover.
[29 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I understand. Yeah.
[29 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that that's what you want to look for?
[29 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's randomly inflationary. Yeah. Yeah.
[29 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Umm, yeah, pretty much, yeah. So as an example, if you called and declined the indexation on your policy, instead, the premium payable in your following year of card would only go to $120.11 a fortnight. Umm, and at that point then your benefit amount would remain the same as the $500,000 for another 12 months. All right, umm, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website.
[29 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : OK. Uh huh. Cool.
[29 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Regardless, anyway, Mark, but we will send you a copy of this premium protection with your full documents to keep and read yourself anyway, OK, umm, just for the call, and I've mentioned this already, but do need to read this part as an indication. If you make no changes to the policy, the premiums next you'll be $120.11 fortnightly at $500,000 of color.
[29 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK, Uh huh.
[29 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and we give you a refund. So we call this a real reward. Following your first policy anniversary day, we will refund you 10% of the premiums you paid in that time as a thank you to spend however you like. It'll equal $277.95 and I'm pretty sure by the sounds of, uh, of it mate, you've probably already done a will, but umm, we're gonna send you a free online legal will from safe will.
[30 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, OK. I just did that.
[30 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Uh, if you want, if you want to update a will, you can, umm, they do cost $160.00 mate, but you're just gonna be free.
[30 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : I just actually did that with safe real, right?
