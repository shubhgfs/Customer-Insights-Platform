[8 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : One second. No, that's prob no worries. Give me one second here. I just need to jump out of this profile. Sorry about this, shouldn't take too long. Just loading it up now. Alright, so with the annual income for for your wife being less than $50,000 per per annum, it's just lower the level of cover that we can offer. So it would be from $100,000 up to $1,000,000 of cover for for your wife for for Celia, not me to quote her on the $1,000,000 as well.
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
