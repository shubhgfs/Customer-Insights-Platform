So tell me a bit about yourself, Liz, have you had life insurance before or is this something you're potentially new to? What's your situation?
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I've had a I've had it. I wasn't involved. I was paying money to a funeral company. I say when you get reservations.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I'm sorry to hear. That's no good. Yeah. OK.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : So I just look looking for somewhere to cover again.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha. Gotcha. OK. And with respect to your personal situation. So I mean, obviously there's something like life insurance. It's not really there for you. Most of the time it's it's been left behind to someone else you care about. What's that look like here? Who who are your loved ones?
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I do have a partner, but I have children too.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : If you've got kids, if you've got a partner who's in your life, Sure.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : They're all grown-ups. They're adults.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. Yep. So they're all.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Oh my goodness, they're adults.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah.
[3 minutes][Customer] : Some of them are not even under. I had them under TH.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : They was under the same company, so none of us are covered for anything.
[3 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Right, right. OK. Got you.
[3 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : If any accidents or death happened, you tell me.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : And just how many kids have you got? Oh, wow. Big family.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : I had seven, I got six.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK. And grandkids as well.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Hey, I'm not carrying all of them.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Wow.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : There are 16 grandchildren, but that is that is small. That is small.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : You're, you're a a matron of the of the, of the family of the empire.
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : That's only small.
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So, Liz, if something happened to you, that's small, is it? I've got 2, I've got two kids. So that that to me is small, 16 grandkids and and seven children is, is a big family to me. But look, everyone too, I mean, to be fair, my wife's Lebanese and she's got a big family as well and her, her mum had 13 kids in the family. So I know what you mean when you say it's small.
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I'm the baby of 12.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. OK, there we are.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : I'm indigenous. I'm Abiginal.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So, OK, Yeah, cool. Very good. So Liz, with the cover, it's really simple what we do if we provide that financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away, knock on wood together. I'm hoping that's not for a long time to come, right. But whenever that day arrives, hopefully in the distant future, whenever that day arrives, we can leave that benefit amount to your chosen loved ones. So you nominate the amount that's gonna work best for you, and that amount gets left to your chosen loved ones. You can nominate up to five people. You can nominate different amounts to each of them. You can arrange it in any way you see fit just through the beneficiary form that we send out to you there. So what we do initially is I'll take you through an overview, an overview of the cover and some pricing options to see if there's something that's gonna work for you. Then we'll confirm your eligibility simply through some help from last up questions just to make sure you can take the cover. Assuming that we get you approved and you're happy with the terms and conditions, we can then put the cover in place and send the documents out to you to review. Make sure you're happy with everything. OK? Irrespective of, of what we do today, I'll still be able to send out information to you so that you can read over and and help you make a decision.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Alright now Liz, one of the requirements to confirm your, your circumstances as it does impact the cost is your smoking status. So have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Well, I don't smoke.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Very good. Now.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : I never smoking when I was 13.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Oh, yeah. I, I mean, I, I think we've, we've all tried.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : High school age is just for me up. Oh no, made me 6.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, sure. But you, but you critically, you haven't had one in the last 12 months, right?
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, very good. So with with the amount to cover that you can select if it's anywhere from $100,000 as a minimum to $500,000 as a maximum. Obviously the higher the amount you select, the higher the cost will be. So what we'll do is we'll load up an amount as a point. I'll then share the costs with you and you can tell me Cam that's either affordable and I'm happy with that or no Cam, it's way too high. I I need to come down or that's affordable, but I want to look at something higher. Can you go up so, so we can find the right fit for your budget? OK. And when we find the right fit, we'll then confirm your eligibility. Now it goes up and down and increments of $50,000. But to start somewhere it is what amount would you like to look at first?
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, let's try the hide the mouse because I have a lot of chips and grannies.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, W sure. Yeah, Cour of course. And then don't be afraid to tell me Liz if it's if it's too expensive, we can come down. OK.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : If it's too high, then I'll come down, yeah.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. So starting at the $500,000 based on your current age and circumstances, the cost will work out to be per fortnight $227.93 for $500,000.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that is a lot.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, now TH that will work.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : That that is a lot. That's the moment.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, that's too much. Did you say? Yeah, yeah, of course there's there's no problems. So coming down it works in a linear fashion. So as you halve the amount, you also halve the cost. OK.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Umm, yeah, at this point of time.
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So as an example, for your $250,000 would be $113.96 a fortnight. If you went down to $150,000, it'd be $68.38 a fortnight. And the lowest option we have is $100,000. That's gonna be $45.59 a fortnight. Are any of those amounts potentially going to work in your budget?
[7 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Actually went to 250,003. Good thing.
[8 minutes][Agent] : The 2:50, so that's $113.96 a fortnight. Do you think that's gonna be affordable?
[8 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : I just also wanna make it, Liz, just making sure that you're aware that this is a step to premium. It's going to generally increase each year as your age. Additionally, with the policy, it has what's called automatic indexation. And that means the each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with the associated increases in premium until you reach the maximum benefit amount or until a policy anniversary following your 75th birthday. Now you can opt out of this automatic 75th birthday, so 75th birthday policy anniversary following your 70th birthday.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : 75th, 56th That's about why.
[8 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So that's only for the well, that's not, that's not for the policy. The policy will stay in force. This is only referring to the automatic indexation. So what that means, Liz, is if you want to see the benefit increase each year, so go up by 5%, you can leave that automatic indexation in and that will stay in in force. So we'll keep going up each year by 5% until you either reach the maximum benefit amount or you, uh, hit the PO your anniversary following your 75th birthday. After that point in time, it's not gonna keep going up on you. It's just gonna stay the same. OK? Now with that automatic indexation, it's not mandatory. It's up to you whether you want to leave it in or take it out. So you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year to give you a quick indication. Just try and illustrate that for you, Liz. As an example, if you make no changes or an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium in the next year would be 100 and 3544 cents a fortnight, but your benefit would go up to six, $262,500. If you don't want to see it increase, you'd prefer to leave it at the $250,000.
[9 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : None.
[9 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : That's fine too. You can opt out, leave your benefit amount at the $250,000, and then as a result, your premiums will work out to be a little bit cheaper instead. OK?
[10 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[10 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So that's your choice. Each year we'll send you out renewal notices 30 days prior to the renewal, usually around that time, and we'll explain what that cost looks like so you have that choice each year. OK.
[10 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Sir.
[10 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : And of course, Liz, you can also find further information about a premium structure on our website at any stage if you need that. And the next step, Liz, is to make sure that we can still offer you the cover. So I'm gonna run you through those questions. Umm, Now before I jump in on the application, I just wanna quickly note down address details so that once we're finished talking, I'll be able to send everything over to you. Umm, what's your post code for your home address, please, Liz?
[10 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : 4868 what was that white rock?
[10 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : And you're in the sense of what's what's your suburb and the street name and number ID.
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : It's unit 1 #7 Audio code Idaho.

And what that means, hopefully never, of course, but it means that if you're diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, the claim can actually be paid out in full and directly to you to help you with any costs you may have at that time and hopefully give you the best chance of overcoming that diagnosis if it were to occur.
