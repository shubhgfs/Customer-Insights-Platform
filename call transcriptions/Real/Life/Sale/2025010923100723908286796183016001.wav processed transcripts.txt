[57 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[59 seconds][Agent] : Thanks Rachel. Now please be advised that calls are recorded. Any advice are provided is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. Now just to help me understand your situation a little bit better there, Rachel. Umm, in terms of a life insurance, what are you looking for in a life insurance to do for yourself? Is it uh, for any like commitments that you have financially, like any mortgages to cover that off with? And so, yeah.
[1 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, just to have a mortgage and just to sort of make sure the kids have something.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, for the kids as well. How many kids do you have, if you don't mind me asking? 2 girls. Yeah, still quite young or dependent on you.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : 22 girls, Yes and no.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, right. Just kind of like in that age.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 01/25 and 1:17. But yeah, just sort of a make sure that I'm still looking after them.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, yeah, of course. You know, you never stop becoming the mum. It's a lifetime thing, isn't it?
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : That's true. And I'm dead.
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Regardless if they go off and yeah. And. And that's right, exactly right. So yeah, it'd be nice to of course leave the world behind for your two girls there, Rachel. But realistically, you know, if something were to happen to you, which is what the life insurance is designed to provide some sort of Peace of Mind, uh, what do you think are the things that you need to take care of for your kids there? A. And of course that mortgage as well.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Well, well, that's sort of it.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : MMM.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : I sort of want to make sure that the grant leaves me with any burdens and that, yeah, they sort of can help them, yeah.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : MMM, yeah, yeah, fair enough. Because, umm, you know, being in my situation and my parents a little bit older than me, you know, umm, I was born quite late in my mom and dad's life. Umm, you know, I'm concerned about, you know, those things that I don't really want to better them with umm, you know, my own financial circumstances, of course. So we, we can never tell without, uh, with children, right? So yeah.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : No, my, what my mum was just saying there's my myself and my middle brother.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : What It's MMM, OK. Oh, OK, yeah. Did you get along with them?
[2 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : There's five years difference and then there's she had another son and there's 20 years difference between him and he's more like a brother to my daughter than.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Because oh, OK, yeah, fair enough. I do have umm, aunties as well from my mom's side that a lot younger than me, and it's weird to call them aunties.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Little little kids running around. So it's a bit weird.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : People used to think he was my son because we obviously look alike.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : But look, besides the FO, yeah, yes, fair enough.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Those, my brother, were like, oh, did your parents remarry?
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And and for yourself, the Rachel, I guess for your little brother that you kind of like have that relationship where you are looking after you're responsible for him as well, that sort of thing.
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : I'm like, no, yeah, yes, yes, I'm gonna make fun of you. But I'm I really?
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, fair enough it's been an odd 1 isn't it because you've got your of course your maternal instincts, but it is your brother as well at the same time yeah alright, it's a bit of umm unique situation there, but uh Rachel with us cover there. Umm, it's exactly what umm we discussed there. So it's just to provide some sort of financial protection. You know, the idea is hopefully not for a long time and hopefully you are around for your kids and, and you're a little brother is there as well for a long time. But, umm, to give you some Peace of Mind there, you know, uh, that if something that happened to you, they'd be able to cover off that mortgage or, you know, have some sort of, umm, legacy to lean towards there to, to maybe, you know, do something in their life or their own or whatever it is that they need that money for.
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Now, when you mentioned leaving burdens behind for your family, the Rachel with this cover, there's an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to a maximum of $20,000 to help with funeral cost or any other final expenses. It's just to, uh, the idea behind it, it's just to leave it any of those immediate costs that they might be dealing with, umm, you know, when you pass away, umm, so that, you know, they can use that for things like, uh, funeral expenses like I mentioned, but also things like, umm, you know, that mortgage that you might have that's still rolling on. OK.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Now, uh, how this works, uh, Rachel, is you're able to nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this amount. Uh, so be your children there. If they are underage, it does go to their guardian. So just keep that in mind that you're able to send from 1:00 to 5:00 beneficiaries, Umm, and we'll keep it nice and simple for you. So Rachel, so our application process is done over the phone. We've got no forms to fill in or anything like that. Uh, we'll simply just take you through some health and lifestyle questions and this will determine the pricing and the terms of the policy that we can offer.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Uh, keep in mind as part of your cover as well, there's also a terminally ill advanced payout that I can explain a little bit later down in detail, uh, once we get an approval there. OK, umm, about any questions for you so far there Rachel, before we hop into some pricing.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Not yet.
[5 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, all sounding nice and straightforward.
[6 minutes][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes][Agent] : Yeah. I in terms of, you know, the, what you're looking for in a life insurance, is that ticking your boxes so far or do you have any other concerns?
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I don't want something that's complicated.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. Yeah. Uh, we'll keep it nice and simple for you then, Rachel. Umm, just very quickly on my end. Uh, what's your preferred title there, Rachel? Is that Miss Mrs.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : And yeah, news please.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : and Miss Miss. No worries. I'll get some pricing loaded up for yourself. We do take into account your smoking service there, Rachel. So have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months, yes or no? OK, thank you. And if you wanted to look into cover over 1,000,000 there, Rachel, do you just need to ask you a question about your income? So is your current annual income $50,000 or more?
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : No Yep, yes.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Thank you and I'll get that loaded up. I see on our website you put through an inquire for $1.5 million.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : I wo would prefer more but that was the maximum it would let me do.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Umm, yeah, OK.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : It is, uh, kept, uh, based on your age there, uh, Rachel, that's the highest that we can look at, but we can also start from $100,000 like I mentioned. What's a realistic amount for you to maybe start looking to leave behind for you, uh, for your kids And, uh, if you wanted to include your little brother in there too.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Well, just 1 1/2 doesn't really cover a surname.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, fair enough. Umm. But look, if you do decide to take other life insurance with other companies that Rachel, this doesn't stop us from paying that either way. The only question that we do ask is if you have existing life insurance policies with other life insurance companies with a combined total sum assured of more than $5 million.
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : What?
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but anything afterwards that you take out of it, uh, that's none of our concern. It's just more so, umm, at this stage, uh, when we're talking to you now, uh, we'll take you through those questions as well. OK. Now for the one and a half million dollars of cover for yourself, uh, Rachel, you're looking at a indicative payment of $147.72 per fortnight there.
