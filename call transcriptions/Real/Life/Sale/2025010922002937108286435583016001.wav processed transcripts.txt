[1 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : No.
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. Alright, we went through all the rest of the questions there, so that's fine. So I'll just load this one up for us. Thank you. Alright, so like I mentioned in reference to the the dry skin that was on your ear that had to get frozen off, we're gonna refer the application to the underwrited based on that.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : None.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Now with that in mind, I'll just explain to you the process and what the terms of the cover are on that. Just give me one quick second, OK? So the way that this one is gonna work for you will be sorry. I'm just bringing it up so we can make sure that's all 100% accurately covered for you.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : None.
[2 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, so if approved this policy will cover you for deaths due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. There is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay your claim in full.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Now the premium is stepped, which means that it will generally increase each year. In addition, the policy has automatic indexation, which means that each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium until you reach the maximum benefit amount or until the policy anniversary. Following your SEV 75th birthday, you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year. And as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy and you decline that indexation, you keep it the $800,000 Abraham, your premium next year would stay the same at $79.87 per fortnight.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : None.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : You can also find information about our premium structure on our website. And so while your application is being assessed, you will be covered for accidental deaths, which pays out of deaths was due to direct result of an accident cover under this last until the insurer makes a decision on your application or 30 days from today, whichever is earlier.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : And so basically what we do for our customers here in this situation is we get you to note down a preferred payment date and the preferred payment method. Uh, we'll send it off to the underwriter for them to review. And then once they come back to us and they're happy to accept the policy and we can send it out for you to go over, make sure it's right for you. Obviously, we don't expect you to nominate a payment date anytime soon. You can select a date in the future. We can forward date that to a day that's comfortable for you and then whatever that you choose, you do get a 30 day cooling off. So just in case something happens and you can't continue it or you change your mind, you can cancel within that 30 days and get a full refund of your premium unless the claims be made.
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so I'll, uh, grab that date from you and note down to pay the details and then I'll read you a declaration so I can get this assessed by the underwriter.

Are you happy for me to record your acceptance of this policy now? And then we'll send all the documents out to you via e-mail and post for you to review. Is that OK? Awesome.
