In fact, with our life insurance, we designed it so you won't need to visit a doctor. There's no medical checks, no blood test involved either. In fact, if you're happy with the insurance there, Irene, if it's suitable, affordable and we'll do what you're after, then today all you'll need to do to apply for the insurance is over the phone. We'll just ask you a couple of simple yes and no questions regarding your health. And your answers to these questions will determine whether you get accepted for the life insurance or not. OK. Yeah. Now there can be some changes made to the quote or even the terms and conditions, all based on your medical history.

[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm not smoking.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, good for you. Healthy choice. The cost does work out to be much cheaper if a non-smoker, so wise decision there. All right, good for you. And how how much life insurance would you like me to quote you on today?
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : What are my options? What what what that's Yeah, I need you to guide me through that. What are my options?

[5 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Right, Right.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : From there on it goes up in $50,000 increment, so 152 hundred 250 etcetera, up to a maximum of half $1,000,000 cover based on your age there, Irene.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : OK. And that's. Yes.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK, check the amount you choose, I'll work out the cost for you and as I said earlier, if it's suitable, great.

[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK is an amount you want to look at first.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : What about the income protection? Sorry, Danny, what about the income protection that I have already in place?
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So this one affect your this one affect your income protection as it's a completely separate policy. Life insurance and income protection are completely separate. It won't affect it.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So is there anything included in that life insurance policy that can be can be covered for if something go goes wrong and I lose income?
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : No, not with the life insurance, no.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Again, the life insurance is a death policy. So it doesn't have any sort of income protection component included with it. It does have a a terminal illness benefit which I hope you never get to use, of course, Touchwood, but that is included. It also the reason why I wanted to start with the life insurance for you, because there's also a funeral component included as well with the life insurance.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : OK, Alright, OK, so alright, let's look into that. Yeah.
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, sure. Well, what amount do you want to look at first? How much would you like to leave behind in case for when the time comes and you pass away again? The minimum is 100,000 and there it goes up to a maximum of 500,000.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK. Based on the opinions and all that, that. That depends, of course, how much you pay every fortnight or whatever that is.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Of course. So again, you just let me know the amount and then I'll work up the premium and we can adjust afterwards because it's the premiums based on the amount you've chosen and on the few other factors, obviously your age and the smoking status as well.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, of course. Alright.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 300,000. Did you say? Yeah, sure, let's see. So if you go for 300,000, then that'll come to 1 total payment per fortnight for you, Irene, of $106.61 a fortnight.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : If we say 3 Hun if we the subway through OK.
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So Oh well, there you go.
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : And at the moment for income protection 316 or 49, so OK, So if, if if you go to 500,000, what would that be?
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, let's see. So if you bump it up to the maximum, half a million now a Fortnite, that'll be $177.69 a Fortnite. So roughly about eighty, $8889 a week though roughly. And that's for the maximum.
[7 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, Alright, OK.
[8 minutes][Agent] : Now and again, the reason why I started with the life insurance is because included with this policy for you, Irene, there are a few additions.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So there is an advance payment for your funeral cost. So let your family know about this. So basically how that works is there is an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount, which we can pay up to a maximum of $20,000 to your family when you pass away to take care of your immediate funeral cost.
[8 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, ALS, also included is a fully legalized will for you. Have you already got your will set up or not yet?
[8 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Nah, not yet.
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Well, you get one absolutely free and it's fully legal. It's worth $160.00. OK, So you can fill that out in your own time.
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And one more thing, once you hold our life insurance policy with us for a year following your first 12 month anniversary date, we'll actually give you back a refund. We'll refund you back 10% of all the payments you paid into this insurance just for staying lawyer with us for a year, OK? So that'll come to a total refund of $461.99 you'll get back from us next year just for staying with the following the first four month anniversary. OK.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK, alright then yes, OK, OK.
[9 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Now would you want to maybe look at the lower amount instead of the 500,000 perhaps or would you feel that that might be suitable and manual to leave that security behind when the time comes?
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Now let's go ahead with the the full amount. I mean if if it's 177 a a fortnight as you said.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : And, and and 69 cents, yeah, $177.69. Sorry if I missed that earlier there. I read my policy.
[9 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, it's probably me.
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[9 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : So 177.
[9 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Correct.
[9 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : So reality is that $177.69 a fortnight with that full amount and you'll have a life insurance funeral and, and now and and, and some sort of a broader understanding of income protection. Is that correct or not? A terminal. Terminal. No. Seven.
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So I I'm I am, I am I TER terminal terminally ill advanced payment. Yeah. So, so keep in mind the terminal illness benefit.

[24 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[24 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Just let me know, OK?
[24 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : That would be lovely time. Thank you. Mm, hmm.
[24 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Oh my pleasure. All good. So I'll just let you wear again. It was due to the your your premium has risen due to your disclosure in the asthma section, which require more than one inhaler.
[24 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[24 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Now what I do want to just let you wear though. Keep in mind that even though that loading has applied, they have not excluded you for the asthma.
[24 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : MM. Hmm.
[24 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, so Touchwood, but if anything arises from that in the future, you'll still covered again. This the only exclusion is suicide in the 1st 13 months, which already told me that's not on your agenda. OK, So I just want to to remind you about that, that they're not excluding you for the asthma, you are still covered for it.
[25 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Thank you. Thank you.
[25 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, my pleasure.
[25 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[25 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : All good. No worries and I'll let you wear now that with that said, the loading now has RIS. So your premium has risen to a total of $266.53 a fortnight for the half $1,000,000 cover, which about 133 a week at the moment. Of course.
[25 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK, so with that in mind, can we go down to perhaps 3?
[25 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : No, not at all. I can do.
[25 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : I don't want to take too much of your time, but how bad is it?
[25 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : I can do as many quotes as you like.
[25 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[25 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : I want to make sure we find something suitable for you. So don't worry about me. I'm I'm, I'm, I'm just doing my job. So you, you, we'll, we'll.
[25 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. Thank you.
[25 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : My pleasure. All good. Do you want to look? Did you say 300 or 350? Did you say or?
[26 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : It's about 350.
[26 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Sure? Yeah.
[26 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yes, just to make sure that I cannot order it.
[26 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Let's see, same same thing once we bring up the price of the 350, don't be shy to let me know. Again, you're not wasting my time at all. We can always change it afterwards if you wanted to look at something else.
[26 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, alright.
[26 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK, thanks. Give me one SEC. I just need to change it over. It won't be long. OK, here you go. So now if you bought it down to 350,000 with the loading, you're now looking at a total of 1 eight, $686.57 a fortnight, so about roughly 93 a week roughly there.
[26 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK, You know what time I think we're gonna go with that amount?
[26 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Irene, you F you feel that might be a bit more comfortable and manageable for you at this stage.
[26 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, at this given time. I can change that at any given time. Is that correct? Oh.
[26 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Not at any given time, but I'll, I'll just actually going to let you wear. So keep in mind that if this is suitable for you now, but later on, the situation does change because we obviously understand it. That's why it's called life insurance. As we get older, things do change. So you can always call back if you feel that it's stretching your budget, it's a bit too expensive, or you may not even need so much because who knows, in the next couple years, you may not even need so much coverage. So you can simply call back and you can always call back in and apply to reduce how to cover it down. You can apply to that anytime you like as well. OK.
[27 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[27 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : But for, but for more cover there, Irene, you can always call back and apply for a separate top up policy with us or you can always, sorry, call back and apply to increase the amount with us subject to time, so long as you apply for that extra cover before you turn 75.
[27 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's OK. Oh, that's that's awesome. Thank you for under for putting that a close.
[27 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah.
[27 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : What is the life insurance? What is the period that I will be covered up to what age?
[27 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : There's no expiry date. So if you keep up with your payment, this will cover you 24/7 until you pass away.
[27 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[28 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : And I mentioned, I understand you mention you're not a pilot, but you do go on plane. So if you do tend to travel a fair bit as well, so long as you keep up with your payments overseas, this also covers you overseas as well. So you've got Peace of Mind. You're predicted worldwide for this insurance.
[28 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Awesome, awesome. Then let's go.
[28 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure, sure. Perfect. Now finally, last thing I also need to ensure you understand with this policy is that your premium is step, which means that it will generally increase each year. Irene, now what?
[28 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Let's do it, Yes?
[28 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : I just wanted to make sure you understand as well. Obviously as you may be aware with inflation each year, everything getting more and more expensive as you do get older. Now to keep up with the rising cost of living, what we're actually going to offer you, and this is completely optional by the way, it's your choice. You don't have to take advantage of this if you don't want to, but each year we will offer you to increase your life insurance amount by 5% each year just to keep up with the rising cost of living. But again, it's up to you to accept it or if, if not, you can just opt out of it and remain at what you're insured for. Again, it's your choice.
[29 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[29 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, Correct. No, no, no, no, no, no, not by 5%, in fact. Well, what I'll do is I'll give you, I'll, I'll let you where actually, what'll be next here for you? We have a tool which calculates it, so I'll load it up. We have a premium projection screen here. Just keep in mind though, that as I mentioned, this policy does have automatic indication, which means that each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associate increases in premium until you reach the maximum benefit amount or until the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday. But as I said, you can opt out of this automatic indication each year if you wish.
[29 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : So if that is the case, is the the premium will go up 5% as well or according to the yes, right, Yes, OK.
[29 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Now I'll give you the indexation for next year just so you can see the difference. Now it just states here that the premium projections are indicative only, Irene, and they assume you don't make any changes to your cover, OK. So as an indication for next year, OK, if you make no changes to your policy and you did decide to accept that 5% increase, that means next year your life insurance will grow by 5%. Instead of 350,000, it'll rise to 367,500. And then the cost of the insurance next year will increase to $221.61 a fortnight if you decided to accept that 5% increase. So what we're going to do is we'll notify you in advance, generally about a month before your policy ends, about four weeks time, we'll say, hey Irene, your cover's about the end of the next couple weeks. This is what the cost would be for next year if you decide to accept the 5% or not. And then you can choose what you want to do.
[30 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, awesome.
[30 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Some years you may not need it, so you can just opt out of it and remain at the 350,000 or whatever amount you're insured about that time. While other years you might want to accept it. Just keep up the cost of living. Again, it's completely your choice each year.
[30 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's good.
[30 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect.
[30 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Excellent.
[30 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : And finally, you can find information about our instruction on our website as well, should you want to have a look at that yourself.
[30 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, alright. Thank you.
[30 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, my pleasure. But again, congratulations. Don't forget to let your family know that there is the advance payment of your funeral insurance, funeral payout as well with this policy. So it's all in the one cover for you.
[31 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Mm, Hmm.
[31 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So remind them that they can request the 20% of the benefit amount up to a maximum of $20,000, which we can pay in advance to deal with your expenses.
[31 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK. Alright. Thank you.
[31 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : And now with the loading that's supplied, which has changed the cost. Once you hold this with us for a year now, Irene, following your first policy anniversary, we're now going to refund you back $485.08 just for staying with us for a year.
[31 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK, good one. Thank you.
[31 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Alright, Hopefully that'll come in handy for you your your birthday next year because I can see your birthday is coming up soon.
[31 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's right. Am I taking aviation plane?
[31 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Happy birthday in advance.
[31 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm not Jamie. I'm just joking.
[31 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : You're joking. OK, All good. All good. I thought you were, but cheers for letting me know.
[31 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : No, thank you.
[31 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : My pleasure. Well, Irene, congratulations. Now that you're approved, what I'll do is I'll get you covered immediately. So basically, how the how how we sort out the policy for you is once we end this phone call, you're covered right away. OK.
[32 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Now I'm OK.
[32 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : You're not required to make a payment today, so So what we do is we cover you immediately. In about 1520 minutes, you'll receive all the documents emailed to irene.caligaros1@det.nsw.edu dot AU to be able to read over everything in black and white, make sure it matches our conversation and that you are happy to keep it.

So they should arrive in your mailbox probably early next week while you're waiting. Again, you'll get the e-mail from us in the next half an hour today. OK, Yeah, sure.
[32 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Alright, Jamie, the only thing is now I do have that income protection insurance that I cannot afford any longer because I've got the life insurance. So how can I stop that income protection because I've got the life insurance now.
[32 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. No worries. So what we can do is once we set up this life insurance policy for you, I can then transfer it to the cancellation team and they can cancel your income protection and replace it with the life insurance for you, OK?
[33 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK, sounds good.
[33 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, all good. Awesome. So the way so the way we set up the payment for you is we let you select attain the future that's suitable when you'd like for us to debit up the first payment, OK?
[33 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[33 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : And that'll leave you enough time to read over the e-mail, double check the policy just to ensure you are 110% happy with everything. Only then if you're happy with it all, we'll get it out the first payment from your account on the date that you've chosen in the future and will come out each fortnight on the same day. But on the other hand, let's assume you did change your mind or you've read over the e-mail, you don't want to go through the insurance anymore, then no worries. There's no cancellation fees. You can just give us a call back and you can apply to end your policy and you won't be penalizing anyway, OK.
[33 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK, so if in the meantime will I be covered?
