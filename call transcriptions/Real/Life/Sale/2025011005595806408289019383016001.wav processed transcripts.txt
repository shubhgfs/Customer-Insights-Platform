[18 seconds][Customer] : McCartney? William Martin Date of birth is the date of the 4th 2005.
[23 seconds][Agent] : Hello there. You are a male Australian resident, is that correct? Thank you. So all calls are recorded. Any advice provides general in nature may not be suitable to your situation. And what's prompted the inquiry? What's great, looking into life insurance at the moment.
[27 seconds][Customer] : Yes, just had always thought about it and one day we Bo bit the bullet and did it.
[46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[46 seconds][Customer] : You never know.
[47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fair enough. Yeah, that's OK. So that's the first time really inquiring about life insurance. Yeah. OK.
[49 seconds][Customer] : But yeah, I went, Mum and Dad went and Rena new days the week before so and I might as well go and do it as well.
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Right, that's fair enough. Well, the life insurance, because it's not something you'd need to use for a very, very long time.
[1 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, hopefully.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but it's just there to give you that piece of buying knowing that if anything were to happen and there is going to be some money readily available for your loved ones. Now we do have a series of health my style questions that we need to take you through just to see if it is something that you are eligible for. But we do keep it nice and simple. There's no need to have any medical check up to the GP or any blood test that it's just a series of health questions over the phone.
[1 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, OK.
[1 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Now let's have a look at some pricing first. So can I just confirm that you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no? Perfect. And is your current annual income $50,000 or more?
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : No, it's about 50.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK? Would you say that it is 50,000 or more or would it be just under 50,000?
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, just on the book. It's got on AP.
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : I'm a I'm an apprentice so.
[1 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : That's fine. And you're eligible for any amount between 100,000 up to $1 million. How much coverage do you think you'd need to leave behind?
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Oh I'll, I'll just, I don't know, can I? Can I change the amount however needed?
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I mean, there's no right or Yeah, absolutely. So how it works, I mean, if you choose an amount and you start on that amount, let's say in five years time or something, and say you've got a mortgage or you've got, you know, a partner or you've got other expenses that need to be covered, then you can always give us a call back and apply subject to eligibility for more cover. And vice versa, if you feel like your situation changes, you no longer need the same level of cover, you can always apply to reduce it as well. That is pretty flexible. Yeah.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Maybe 300 and some 1300 thousand.
[2 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Let's use it as a starting point anyway, give you an idea on what the price would be, and then we can work way up and down if we need to. But for 300,000, it would be $14.65 every two weeks. That's fortnightly approximately $7.00 a week. How does that sounding?
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Do you want to look at any other amount? So.
[3 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : And how much would how MU if you went up, how much would it increase? But let's say I just let scroll and I went the top of the line million.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Today. So I've got 100 bucks a month.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : The million would be $48.83 per fortnight, Yeah, approximately. Did you want to look at any other amounts between those two?
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, 7UP gonna do 750 just for your bank.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK. You can take you through as many as you need to. 750 is $36.62 a fortnight. Sure.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'd probably go that one.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Well, let's see that the 7:50 for the time being, I'll confirm a couple more details and then we've got those health questions. I'll take you through and ultimately the the health questions. Let us know if you're eligible to take out life insurance, but also if there are any changes.

I will just let you know that if you are approved this policy will cover you for death due to any cause except the suicide in the 1st 13 months and it does include a living benefit as well. So the terminally ill advanced payment hopefully not benefit you'd ever need to worry about. But if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a medical practitioner we then pay that claim out to you in full.

[13 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yep that's fine. Now do just keep in mind your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year. In addition though, this policy has automatic indexation, so this means that each year your son insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premiums until you reach the maximum benefit amount or until the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday. You cannot doubt of this each year so it is optional This is just going to add a level of flexibility to the cover. So as you get older, if you feel like you need more cover, this is just one way to gradually increase it. So we offer to increase every renewal period up until obviously that the policy anniversary following your 70th birthday until you reach the maximum benefit amount. But it's up to you at that point whether you feel like you need to have that additional cover added on. I'll just show you how that works though. So an indication, if you make no changes to your policy, your benefit amount next year would be $787,500 and your fortnightly premium would be $38.45 per fortnight.
[14 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[14 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So it's roughly a $1.80 difference the following year. If you needed that additional cover, however, you can decline it. It's up to you. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. Now the results of the application have just loaded up and absolutely no surprise. So you definitely sound very healthy. So congratulations, you're fully approved and accepted for the life insurance today, which is fantastic. Now based on that, it does allow me to provide you with that cover over the phone today. How that works though is we get all of your proper policy documents sent out to you. So I'll e-mail and post everything else. You can have a good read through it all. The only form we need you to fill in and send back to us is just your beneficiaries form, just so we know who we are paying money out to at the time of the claim. You're also not required to pay anything today either, so you can choose your first collection date generally in the next 30 days. Do you have a pay date coming up that you wanted to align it with?
[15 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I get paid every Thursday.
[15 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Pedda, do you want me to do next Thursday or the Thursday after or?
[15 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Not next Thurs, not the next Thursday. Can do the week after.
