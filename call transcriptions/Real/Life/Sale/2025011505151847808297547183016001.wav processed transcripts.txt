Any advice I provide generally may try, may not be suitable to your situation. So Joanne, because you have been fully approved, umm, what? Their life insurance? I'll just umm, reiterate umm, what I went through with you. Umm, I think I spoke to you, umm, before the, well just just before Christmas actually.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So the life insurance is designed to provide a financial protection for your loved ones to a lump sum pain if you were to pass away. OK, they can use our funds, uh, you know, for umm, you know, to maintain uh, the lifestyle or pay off any mortgage or lines they may have at at the time. Now, umm, because you have been umm, fully approved for the cover. Sorry, just going to pop into this one here for you. So you would be covered. So if we were to set the policy up, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13. OK, now in addition to that, there is also a terminally ill advanced payment that's included in the cover. And what that means is if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will actually pay that benefit amount to you in full while you're still alive. And you can use those funds to assist you with any medi medical expenses you might have at that time.
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, now as well as that there is also a umm, a there is also an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to a maximum of $20,000 to help your loved ones with any funeral costs or any other expenses they might be at the time of your passing as well, OK?

[4 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : That's, well, you, they can, they can use that for whatever, umm, you know, expenses they may have. They don't need to use it towards the funeral, but we do, uh, provide a, uh, that they, that they can ask for an advance kind of 20%. So with the $500,000 cover, umm, the, the maximum amount that they can advance pay though would be uh, $20,000, OK.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : And umm, you know, they can, that they can put that towards any funeral costs that they may need those funds for or anything else they may need to use those, those, those funds for. OK, now, umm, do you have any questions for me so far?
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, no.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Now, uh, as well as that, I will let you know that you, umm, the included in the policy is also a, umm, what we call a real reward. And what this means is following your first policy anniversary date, Joanne, we will actually refund you 10% of the premium that you've paid in that time. Uh, and that we reward based on the $500,000 cover, uh, the $140.46. So that's the amount that would be refunded to you following your first policy anniversary date. Umm, including the documents will also be a free online legal will that's valued at $160.00. Information on how you can access and utilize that free online legal will will be included in all the documentation as well as well as the numbers for their customer support teams. Could you need assistance in getting that in in place?
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, so that that meal is for free, did you say?
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, try, yes. So it is actually valued at $160.00. We have partnered with a company called Safe Will, OK.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : And uh, that that's our free online legal will information on how you can access that will be included in all the documentation when you receive that, that as well. OK.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : And as I said, a number for their customer support team should you need assistance in getting that one in place. If that's something that you don't need, Joanne, you can on forward that to anyone else that you'd like to if, if if you you're not wanting to access that, but that is there for you as well.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, I think I do. I do wanna I will have.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, yes, I know that that that'll be included in all the documentation as well.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK, cool.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, now umm, I will let you know as well that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year. Now, Joanne, umm, in addition to that, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium until you reach the maximum benefit amount or until the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday. But you can actually opt out of this automatic indexation each year.
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So each policy anniversary date, uh, Joanne, you will, you will have the option to either, umm, opt out of that automatic indexation or not. So I'll give you a bit of a premium projection as to what that might look like for you. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year would be $59.83 per fortnight we but that benefit amount will increase to 525,000. Now as I said, based on your own particular circumstances each policy anniversary, you can decide as to whether you wanna opt out of that 5% automatic indexation or not. If you decide you wanna opt out of that 5% automatic indexation, that will mean your benefit amount will remain 100,000 and your fortnightly premium would be approximately $56.98 per fortnight. OK.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : And bear in mind that each each you know at any time if your circumstances change Joanne, you can apply to either decrease the the level of cover. So let's say next year you decide look you don't really need $500,000 cover, $400,000 covering them up. You can apply to decrease the level of cover. You can even call us and apply to add additional work. That would just be subject to eligibility at the time though, OK. But you do have the, that flexibility depending on your circumstances to apply to either decrease or increase the level of cover. As I said, subject to eligibility at the time.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, OK. Yeah.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now, uh, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website now. Umm, so really the only thing that's left here to do is because you have been fully, umm, approved. What we can do is we can get the cover in place for you, umm, immediately. Joanne, you're not actually required to make any payments today. So what we can do is we can actually go through the calendar together and you can select your first fortnightly payment.

I said we can coincide that with pay, any pay days or that you might have coming up in the future and that'll give you that time to read those documents in the, in the meantime.
