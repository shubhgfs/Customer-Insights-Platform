[2 seconds][Agent] : Welcome to Real Insurance. My name is Rob. How can I help you?
[7 seconds][Customer] : Hi, my name is Amandeep Singh and actually I got a policy with you guys already.
[12 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[13 seconds][Customer] : I want my partner, my wife's name included in the airport. Like we want to get another policy or maybe joint policy combined if what are the options available?
[23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we could definitely get your wife covered on the policy umm, and provide her with the same benefits you get umm, with organizing a separate policy. She'll get her own free will kit you had to use, however. Umm, obviously there is the option of having the joint one, but we can definitely look at doing a separate one for her. I mean, it's not going to save you any money or lose you any money because her premiums are going to be based on her, like her age, gender, smoking status, if she's approved, things like that.
[39 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK, Alright, OK.
[57 seconds][Agent] : Umm, is she available with you at the moment?
[1 minutes][Customer] : Yes, she is. Yeah.
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah. Awesome.
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Give me one minute.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. Hi, good morning, ma'am. My name is Rob from Wheel Insurance. How are you?
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Hello, Good. Thank you. Have a good look.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Very well. Thanks very much for asking. A little bit sick at the moment, but you know, umm, yeah. Still going. Still going.
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's a choice going around, you know.
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Umm, yeah, that's it, that's it. Umm, so your husband mentioned that, uh, you guys are looking into life insurance for you. So I'm going to help you out with that today. And you're more than welcome to have me on now to speak. And I can speak with both of you, but predominantly I do need to speak with yourself. So I'll just quickly let you know calls are recorded and any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. And could I get you to confirm for me your name and date of birth?
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, my name is Hafiz for Dylan and date of birth is 20/10/1989.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much. And how pretty just confirming that you are a female as well as an Australian resident.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I am. Yeah.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much. OK, awesome. OK, so the way that this is going to work is I'll explain to you to cover. We can run through some cards together, discuss it, you know, with your husband as well. And then I'll need to take you through some yes or no questions about your health to see if you're eligible. And then if you're accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK, now, uh, Harpreet, may I start by confirming with you regarding your smoking status? Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, no, I don't smoke at all. MMM.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful, beautiful. So with the cover, we can offer between $100,000 up to $1 million worth. How much were you wanting to look at?
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Seven and a half, 77000. What is it like I've got, I think 7 1/2 for myself. Can we can we get the same one? Yeah, 750,000, yeah, that's yeah. So can we get the similar to help?
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : 750,000 Yeah, sure, we can look at the sign for sure, for sure. Now, this policy will include a terminally ill advanced payment in the cover, meaning that if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay the claim in full.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : There's a $10,000 advance payment to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses. And this policy is worldwide protection, so if you travel overseas, you'll be covered no matter where you go. It's also a lifetime cover, so as long as the payments that kept up to date, you can hold the policy for as long or short as you want to. That is entirely up to you.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep, welcome.
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that's the cover in a nutshell. Does that all make sense so far? Beautiful. So for $750,000 cover, we can look at this fortnightly, monthly or annually. How do you guys prefer to look at it?
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep, you can mind please.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Alrighty, then operate if you're approved with no changes made, we're going to be looking at a premium of $50.16 per month. So that works out to be $1.65 per day. How does that sound in terms of suitability?
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine. I think that's good.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Now also keep in mind that the premiums are stepped, which means they will generally increase each year's age. In addition, this policy does have automatic indexation. So this means that each year your sum insured, which is a match you're covered for. This will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. However, it is optional for you and you can opt out of this automatic index taxation each if you want to. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy and you decline the indexation so you keep the amount you're covered for at the $750,000, then your premium next year would be $53.39 per month.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK beautiful. Now when we get you covered, we're going to send a copy of the policy out to you through the post. This will include a free will kit for you to imply in English and legal to use in Australia. What's the best address for us to post this to operate 4/08?
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : It's 4/08, Yeah, it's a thing like my husband's. If you can see his profile there. Or you want me to stay?
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : I unfortunately can't see his one, so I need to get you to confirm it for yourself.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : OK. It's 408 RA DI SICH so that it's loop, LOOP and it's Burbie's Oran Park.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : ORAN Park.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : That's 2570, right? Yeah. Awesome. Uh, now Radisson Loop, this is both your home and postal address.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Hi, Rob. Sorry, can't you get a joint policy like I was thinking to make a joint policy. Is it any benefit for that?
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, honestly.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : I think you mentioned it's not beneficial and it's the same price.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Umm, it's going to cost you the same if she gets added to your policy versus taking out her own. Umm, there's no financial gain or loss. The only key difference is that one, Heartbeat will get her own will kit with this policy and her own beneficiary form. And two, in the event that, uh, you know, one of you was to pass away before the other one, umm, the other person just keeps their policy going. Whereas if you have a joint policy, umm, depending on who passes away, the other person may have to contact us to say that they would like to continue to cover. So that won't affect it. If you have two separate policies, you guys can still have it come out the same day from the same account and same process in that regard. OK, OK.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : The other question is that I'm covered for the same amount of some like the same amount, but my one is $79.
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Uh, so how old are you? Umm, Sir, be fine.
[8 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : So it could be because like a female gender or could be any other reason or 3535367, yeah.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK OK, so age will play a little bit of a role in the price, but also gender does. So even if you guys were the same age, her premium would generally be cheaper than yours because yes, statistically females live longer. A little bit less risk to insure.
[8 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Understand. OK.
[8 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah. Now we get stuck with the long end of the stick. Unfortunately for my wife and I, we say same, same thing. Like, my wife's a lot cheaper than mine, even though she's two years older than me. So that's it now, Harpreet, can I confirm what is your best contact number, please? Yep, Yep, Yep. Beautiful. And what's your e-mail address, please?
[8 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No Sir, it's 04683 88991 HH for house and K for kite, A for apple, U for umbrella, R for rabbit.
[9 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, 201089 Yep. Beautiful. All right, umm, so I'm going to read out a pre underwriting disclosure to you.

[18 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[18 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK so it says an episode is an event, occurrence or recurrence of symptoms with increased severity from normal mood and usually require either medical intervention, referral, treatment or alterations slash adjustment to existing maintenance treatment. Treatment could take the form of medication and or counseling slash therapy. So if someone has mental health symptoms that require treatment, this is an episode. So what? And if they go back to the doctor several times to monitor the situation and or for repeat prescriptions, this is the same single episode. So still one. If, however, they have a relapse or symptoms worsen and treatment needs to be changed or increased, and this constitutes as a second episode, and similarly, if the applicant recovers and treatment stops and the applicant is fine, but at a later date they have to go back to the, uh, to the doctor to seek further advice, this would be a separate episode.
[19 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : I'll say 1:00 to 2:00 because it was like four months of. Like, you know.
[19 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So based on that definition, how many episodes would you say, OK, yeah, sure. And then, uh, it'll ask was it more than one episode or was it just one?

[20 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Was that only after the second one or did you have it for both of them?

[20 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I don't blame you.

If you are replacing an existing policy with this cover, we recommend that you do not cancel that policy until you have received and review that policy in full. So I'll put that, please confirm. Do you understand and agree with the declaration I've just read here, yes or no? Would you like any other information about the insurance now or would you like me to read any part of the PDS to you, yes or no?
