[15 seconds][Agent] : Hi, I'm and Dave, it's guy here calling from Real Insurance. How you going today?
[14 seconds][Customer] : Hello, good. Thank you. How are you?
[20 seconds][Agent] : That's good. Not too bad as well. Thanks for asking there. I'm just following up in relation to a previous conversation about the life insurance that you have with us. I just wanted to run you back through what we can find for you and see if we can help you out with the cover. Now I will just let you know all calls are recorded and any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation there.
[47 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[38 seconds][Agent] : OK now mate, the last time you spoke to us I can see you were waiting on some information there from our underwriter so we do get that back. Can I please have you confirm your full name and date of birth so I can read this out to you?
[55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's among the same 19th of August 1993.
[57 seconds][Agent] : Yep, thanks Almond Dave and you are a male Australian resident is what we got stuck on, I'm pretty sure by reading these notes.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so uh, Hanover has confirmed uh, these uh, with the visa info provided, we're OK to allow you to apply for the real life cover with the residency exclusion to apply. So we can do the cover for you. We can apply for and see if we can get you approved, but there will be an exclusion around residency which I'll explain to you anyway when it pops up. Is that OK? Yep, it doesn't make any difference in your price either mate.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : So mm, hmm, definitely.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, I think it'll just be along the lines if you stop living in Australia, umm, that the cover will just end and finish, if that makes sense.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, so it doesn't cost any extra for that. It's just an exclusion if you stop living here in Australia. All right now. Umm, in that regard, I'm going to put yes to male Australian residency for you now because that's been approved by the underwriter to do so. You're all right for me to do that. Yep. And you go by Mr. your title. Yep. And I've got aharmanchima4889@gmail.com be your best e-mail.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Sure, yes, that's the one.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Thanks mate. And the number I've dialed you on today, is that your best phone number or 478077806?
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep. That's the one.
[2 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yep, thanks Alman. Dave, do you prefer for me to just to call you? Arman?
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Please. That'd be great.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yep, no worries mate. And ah and what, what's your current post code please?
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Please 3029.
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Suburb and straight address.
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : 32 Emma Dr.
[2 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Would that be the postal address for you as well mate?
[2 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : E Double NA Drive Yes, that's the one.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, go on me there. Alright, so I'm just putting that in now. So I'm just going to take you through what this is about. We're going to get your price up and then I'm going to take you through your questions at the end.
[2 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : All right, we'll try and get you some cover in place today to get approved. So I'm in with the cover. It's designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones. The money will be paid out through a lump sum payment. If you were to pass away from there, the money will be paid in full to the beneficiaries of your choice. You can select up to five people as a beneficiary, uh, and that will allow you to allocate, umm, percentage of the money to each family member, to be honest, so they can all get their own amount of the money. Does that make sense? Yeah. If you just want to choose one for now, that's fine, they'll get the whole amount. But, umm, you can, uh, call back at any time over the phone to us and apply to have your beneficiaries change over the phone anyway if you ever need to.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, sure.
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now applying for this through the five to six minute. Yes, when I help the last all questionnaire, these questions determine if we can have you approved on what times we can offer the cover to you and your final pricing. If you get accepted. And once you decide to commence the policy, we will cover you immediately connected to any course straight away. So there's no waiting period to be served on that.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Alright.
[4 minutes][Agent] : OK Ah, I mean, the only thing that we won't cover is suicide in the first, ah, 13 month period. That's all OK, I know it's not nice to think about but suicide will be covered after holding the policy for the 1st 13 months.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, well good now the second benefit will begin immediately too. It's the terminally ill advanced payment. So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave concerned by a medical practitioner, we will pay you out the claim in full while you're alive. So that way you can utilize the money in any way you see fit to help with things like medical costs, setting your family up, or even ticking off a bucket list. Does that make sense?
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So it's there too. AH and then there's also a $10,000 advance payment built into the cupboard of pay for things like funeral calls and final expenses. So your beneficiaries will be able to AH to request that when they claim if you have passed away. And AH, we do generally release the advance payment of $10,000 within 24 to 48 hours for them as well. And that's provided that they've supplied the correct documentation when they make the claim make. So as an example, I mean, we don't need a death certificate unless they can get one. We will accept. So I'm proof by preferring at that time that you've passed away. OK. Does that all make sense so far for you, mate?
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK, yes, that's all clear for now.
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Cool. Do you have any questions at all?
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : No, it's all done so far.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : All right, mate, let's let's check your pricing and whatnot. Let's see what we can form for you. We'll make sure it's affordable. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Sorry. Do I have a cigarette?
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Ahmed, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : No.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, that will help us with your price. So it's very good now, Arman, having a think about your current situation, mate. So whether you've got a mortgage, a family, whatever it may be for you, the minimum covers 100,000. The maximum is 1,000,000 and we can go in the middle of that in 50,000. So I'm going to take you after we get the price up. How to change this over time subject to eligibility up or down with your cover. But for now, whatever you pick here is just to get the policy to start with. So currently how much cover do you think you would want to begin with? Half a meal? Yep, that'll be that. I'll just give you the price for it and I'll explain how you how you can change it over time. OK, so 500,000 we can start on that amount for you today for if we get your approval, of course, for $22.55 a fortnight. How does that sound? I can switch it to monthly. You prefer that? Yep.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK, go for half a million so 5000 sure 49 OK 22 bucks and 44 bucks a month yes, please let's go for a monthly that's.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. There's there's no no difference in price anyway mate. For nightly, monthly, annually are your options for frequency of payment. They're all going to equal the same at the end of each year anyway, so that's just your comes down to your personal preference. If we do monthly my, it'll be $48 and $0.87 a month. So just keep in mind there's 26 fortnights in the year. So when we consolidate it into 12 months it just works out a bit different.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : But it'll be the same at the end of each year. Is that suitable?
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK, is that the best 48 album?
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : That'll be for the 500,000, so $48.87 a month. So that's based on your current age, gender, and spoken status.
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, that'll do for now.
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yep. All good. Right, Let's just take a step back. I just want to teach you a few things so you know what you're doing. So over time, let's say you want to increase your color. OK, There's two ways to do this now. The first way is calling us back before you turn 65.
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : You need to be an Australian resident when you do this still, of course. So if you call back before 65, so long as you're still in Australian resident, you can ask to be reapproved through the health questions again. If you get reapproved again before that age, then you can simply look at your options to increase in your cover in large amounts in one go. OK, so you can see that subject to eligibility that way. The second way is automatic indexation Almond. So every 12 months we're going to send you a renewal. When you read them, there's going to be an indication of what your cover is going to be and how much is going to cost you in the next 12 month.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So when you have a look at that, you're going to say the premium is stepped. So you're going to say that there's going to be a general increase each year based on your age, but you're also going to say what the automatic indexation has done to it as well. Now, automatic indexation is what you control. So automatic indexation means each year your sum insured will automatically increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. So essentially you're going to be covered for a little bit more. If you let it happen that year, it'll cost you bit extra as well. Now the beauty about the automatic indexation, I mean is I like to look at as a positive because it's the way that you can have small increases over time without having to get reapproved to your health questions again, OK? It's really just you rating the renewal. If you like what it says and you leave it, it will happen. If you don't like it for a particular year, 2 minute phone call to us to say, hey guys, thanks for the renewal. I'm going to opt out of the automatic indexation this year. Thanks. And that's it. OK.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So if you opt out in a particular year, your benefits going to stay the same as the year before, which is the coverage you have. And then you won't get that associated increase in your premium for that year. You'll only get the general increase based on your age for that particular year. Does that make sense? Yeah. And and you can opt out of the automatic indexation every single year I'm and up until the policy anniversary after your 75th birthday. So even if you're taking it off for a few years, you still have plenty of you to leave it on when you want it to be there. Does that make sense?
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Cool. Now aside from all that, there's no expiry on this cover OK, So as soon as you get it between age 18 to 64, if you're an Australian resident, umm, that's where that will kick in. So as long as you're paying the premiums on time, you can actually hold this for as long as you want for your whole life if you want OK.
[9 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[10 minutes][Agent] : Umm, there's no looking contract or exit fee though, so it doesn't cost anything to cancel it. So if you don't want it at a certain point, umm, again, there's no obligation to hold it. And umm, that's pretty much the gist of the cover, mate. Does that all make sense? Yeah. Now one other tip as well. You can apply to decrease this cover at any time, OK? If you decrease your cover, your payments will lower accordingly.
[10 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK, OK.
[10 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Now that may not be, uh, you might not need to utilize that for a very long time, But when you get into your later years, like your 50s, sixties, 70s, you might turn around and think, you know what? I've gotten rid of most of my debt. The kids are growing up and moved out. I'd be OK with a bit of less cover. And if you lower your cover, your payments lower accordingly. So it's still affordable in the long run. Does that make sense?
[10 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[10 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, easy. Umm, now I just want to show your premium protection for next year, mate.
[10 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[10 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So let's have a look at if you let it increase next year. OK, I want to look at that first. So it says I'm in deep. Singh, please be aware that all of our premium projections are indicative only and assume that you do not make any amendments to your cover. So as an example, if you do not decline indexation on your policy, the premium payable and you're following your cover will be $51.31 a fortnight. Oh, actually, I'm gonna repay that. That's monthly $51.31 a month. OK. Umm. And then what happens there is if that's, if you let your benefit go higher, so instead of 500 K, you'd be then covered for 525,000, right? So if you read that and you think you know what, I'm happy to say the 500,000 for another 12 months, again, that's where you call and opt out of it. So as an example, if you decline indexation on your policy instead on it, the premium payable in your following year of cover would be $48.87 a month instead and then your benefiting that will remain the same as the $500,000 of cover. OK, now my I'm just having a look here. If you are to opt out of the automatic indexation every year up until 2028, so if you even opt out in 2028, you'll be 34 that year, the monthly premium will still be at $48.87 a month and your benefit will still be the 500 K OK.
[12 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[12 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So again, it's up to you. I think the best thing to do is just read the renewals and you know, choose what you need at that time. You might need some increases here and there. Do you know what I mean?
[12 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[12 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[12 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
[12 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Cool. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premiums next year will be $48.87 a month. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website too.
[12 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[12 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, now we'll pay you some money back as well. It's called a real reward. So following your first policy anniversary date, we will refund you 10% of the premiums you've paid in that time as a thank you. So you'll get back $58.64 to spend how you want after the first four months following the color. We're also going to send you a online free legal will valued at $160.00 with your policy, so you can use that to organise a will. OK, all good mate. Now the next step is to take you through your questions. Let's have a look and check your eligibility and then we can talk about what we can offer you at the end.
[12 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK, Sure, sure, sure.
[13 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, that will be there. Ah, I'm in. I'll need to read you a very quick message that outlines formally how we need to answer these together. Umm, but I just want to make it easy if you might. I'm happy if you just say yes or nose, umm, apart from height and weight. If you get stuck, uh, please tell me before you answer and I'll help you as best I can. Umm, I'm going to try and get you approved. No change.
[13 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[13 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, so it says here. Please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes.

[14 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[14 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, so there is one change so far, but I'm hoping this is the only change that will happen again. It's not. It's not going to affect your price.
[15 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK, alright.
[15 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, so it's just, it's just an exclusion. It says here it is hereby understood and agreed that cover will seize under this policy if the life insurance ceases to reside in Australia. Do you understand and agree to that exclusion, Armin?
