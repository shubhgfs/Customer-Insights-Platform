So it says the application needs to refer to the underwriters assistant. Uh, not only that, in terms of your premium, the premium has risen, OK, umm, due to the mental health question. So that's one to two episodes symptoms of treatment within the last six months.

[23 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So it's just about the $12.00 a week. You have to leave it at that. Or do you want me to bring it back down to the 400,000?
[23 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, that's fine.
[23 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, too easy now. Uh, the other thing is while your application is being assessed, you will be caught for accident to death, which pays out if death is due to direct because it was sort of an accident. Come under this loss until the insurer makes a decision on the application of 30 days from today, whichever's earlier.
[23 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep. OK.
[23 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now what happens if it comes like fully approved, we can obviously accept the policy on your behalf. And from that point which you, you'll be covered under the terms and conditions. Send out of the policy details by e-mail and mail. All you need is fill out the beneficiary's forms. So I'm gonna send that back to us. However, the first payment is the date I'm going to let you select.

[23 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. 14th of March. OK. And then every fortnight from then on.
[23 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : OK, so I get paid every fortnight, so I get maybe if it's approved the 14th of March, yes.
[24 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's fine. So do you want me to put this monthly because, uh, that way you can just put it on 14th, it'll come out on the 14th and every month thereafter.
[24 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : No, we'll just do it fortnight.
[24 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Or leave it as 404 dollars. OK too. So just give me one SEC. 14th of March. And do you want to use BSP, the account number for this or Visa master debit card or credit card? What's easier for you?
[24 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, probably just BSP, it'll be check.
[24 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, savings or checking account, OK. And before I get the BSV account number for me, if it comes actually approved and there's no changes made, are you happy for me to accept the policy on your behalf?
[24 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : I'll have a look at the the policy and stuff like that and then I'll ACC. Am I allowed to accept it myself?
[24 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Uh, no. So what happens is I can, I'll give you the two options, OK, I can send out an e-mail. Just first put the link to the PDF and the pricing. OK.
[25 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[25 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Your other option is I can send this off to the underwriters and if it comes like fully approved, then you can accept the policy on your behalf and send out the full policy documents. So you can sit down and read to that while you're covered. But nothing will come out to the 14th of March if that's when you want the first payment to come out. So you have two options.
