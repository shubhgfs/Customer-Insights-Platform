[59 seconds][Customer] : I have been thinking about it lately and I was literally just going through my Gmail, you know, the promotion section where it gets things then. And I'm like, I'll just have a look into that.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK. What made you stop thinking about it? And they said you can think about it lately.
[1 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : I don't really know. I just, yeah, it's just sort of, yeah, I don't know.
[1 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, fair enough.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : It's just, I suppose, getting a bit older and, you know, facing, facing the fact that you're not going to be around forever.
[1 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Fair enough. Is this your first time looking into something like this?
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : I think so. I'm, I'm trying to think back when our kids were younger. I think my husband and I did have life insurance, but the way that it was set up, it was like the premium just went up. Ridiculous. And now I think we were told there were a couple of ways. Well, we found this out after. Is there a couple of ways whether the premiums were set or I don't know what the other alternative was, but yeah, our premiums just went up ridiculous. And sort of as we got older, obviously our kids got older too.
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yep, OK, uh, OK, Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : So like adults now.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Didn't mean it's not covered kind of thing.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : So it as much now my husband and I together in more.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : So it's kind of like, yeah, I'd just like to think that yeah, if something happened to me.
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : You just want to leave a bit of money behind. Yeah, that's fair enough.
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, look what I'll do. I'll explain to you how all all of it works. We can run through the pricing and if you've got any questions for me, just stop me. OK, I'll let you know. Firstly, Angela, it is very simple in how life coverage works. So at the end of the day, it's designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones in the event that Touchwood something was happening to yourself. Yeah. The way that we do that is through a lump sum payment of between $100,000 up to $750,000, depending on your personal needs. But with the coverage as well, it does also include a terminally ill advanced payment, which means if you were diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a registered medical practitioner, we'll pay out the claim in full in that situation so you can get the best medical care or anything else you might need as well. There's also a funeral component built in. So because funerals do tend to be the most medium expense in your loved ones, in the event that something was to happen, we actually do a $10,000 advance tout to cover those costs, generally paid out within 24 to 48 hours of the claim being made. So it's really designed to give your loved ones immediate access to that money there to handle any immediate final expense as well.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, Yeah, Yeah, OK, cool.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : The cover's not a guaranteed acceptance. Not everyone is eligible for it. Now, we don't expect you to go through any medical checks or blood tests. Instead, we just take you through a series of simple yes and no health and lifestyle questions over the phone. And then if you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Now we'll run through the pricing here. Can I just ask firstly, uh, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months and how much you're looking to cover yourself for, do you think, Angela?
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, I think I've put on there the website 250,000.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : No problem, I'll start there. We can look at a few different amounts as well if you'd like. I'm looking at $250,000 life coverage now. That'll include the $250,000 terminal illness and the 10,000 female advance, so that you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $32.72.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : That is where you do get a 10% refund after the first year. Hold the policy as well.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah. Yeah.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : That's like a little thank you that we do, but that's for OK.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Covered with wheel insurance for my car and we got that, I think.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So that'll be done through. Yeah, that's probably done through our general insurance department.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. That's all.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Uh, I don't handle car insurance, but, uh, umm, but yeah, that'll be for 250,000. Angela, how's that sound to yourself? Did you want to look at any other amounts?
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Pretty happy with that. I don't want to give them too much, you know?
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Look, the, the most important thing is going to be seeing whether you're eligible for it. So what I'll do, I'll take you through those health questions and we can see if you're eligible for the cover.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Before I do that did you have any questions for me so far?

I'll let you know. The policy does include an automatic indexation. Basically what that means is the level of cover goes up by 5% each year and there's an increase in premium based on that. However, you can opt out of those increases each year if you want to keep at the same level of cover. So just please be aware that your premium is step, which means would generally increase each year as you age. In addition, this policy has an automatic indexation which means each year sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increase in premium. You can opt out of this automatic indexation each year as an indication if you keep it at the same level of cover and make no change. So next year premium would be $36.56. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website.

[26 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[26 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Just give me one moment. That's correct. So I'll let you know what we do for you if this does come back fully approved. What we normally do is we organize to have all the policy documents sent out for you today so you can sit down, go through it all and make sure it's going to be the right fit for yourself. Get an e-mail copy of the documents within the next hour and a post copy within two to five business days. Now we'll cover you while you're looking through the documents, but you're not required to make any payment statements that what we do is we let you select the payment day in the future you're comfortable and happy with and then you get a 30 day cooling off. Starting from that day just in case there's a change of mind after you receive the documents.
[26 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sure, that's correct.
[26 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll double check the e-mail address youputdownhereitsuhangela.wolfridgeuh72@gmail.com and I'll grab your postal address. What's your post code Angela? Post code IS6171. What set up is it? And just the street number name there?

[27 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : It's ME double N OK, K, That's right, yes.
[27 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Now this has come back here just in regards the anxiety. The premium has risen. So let me know if this still works for yourself. If not, we can look at a different amount, but for the $250,000 live coverage, which would include the 250,000 terminal in the 10,000 funeral advance, you're looking at, uh, fortnightly $49.07. Do you think that it's to work for yourself?
[28 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep.
[28 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, umm, it does also need to be referred off to the underwriter for assessment just because I manually typed in the stuff due to the, uh, the, the, the eye deficiency. Basically what's happening is when we'll capturing them, that blood disorder question, it was, it was providing another increase in premium, but based on what you had said, how you would no longer risk of it because going through menopause, I wanna have that reassess. So I'm gonna send it off to them. And that's why I've manually typed out what you've told me. Umm, because obviously, you know, if you're no longer risk of the condition, I don't really see why they're applying the risk to the policy there.
[28 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you.
[28 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so I'm gonna get that reassessed for you. Umm, the prices we follow is still exactly the same. So as I said, so we don't collect any payment state.
