[9 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[10 seconds][Agent] : Hi there. Hi, Simon. My name is Sharon. I'm giving a call from Real Insurance. How are you going today?
[16 seconds][Customer] : Good. Thanks. How are you?
[17 seconds][Agent] : Good. Yeah, not too bad. Not too bad. I was just following up on the expression of interest we've received for the income protection insurance.
[25 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[24 seconds][Agent] : The main purpose of the call was just to take you through how it works, have a look at some different prices, see what we can offer at you there as well.
[31 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yeah.
[32 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful.
[32 seconds][Customer] : OK. All good. Yep.
[35 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. I'll let you know as well. Sorry, Simon. So I think earlier when you did pop that quote request through, I accidentally got in touch with your wife there just as both the numbers were down on the policy. She was a little confused, but I've just made sure that I've only given you a number, a call on those occasions from there on out. Now I'll just let you know as well. Our calls are recorded and any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. I'll just confirm I am speaking with Mr. Simon. Was it Fennic or Fennic? Fantastic, beautiful. And then I've got your date of birth here as the 2nd of June 1977. Yep. And just lastly confirming that you are a male and an Australian resident.
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes.
[1 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. OK, that's all the checks out of the way for there. So I think I can see when was that popped through. I think you may have called through a little earlier today, but didn't have too much time just to run through it there. I'm just going to ask what sort of prompted the interest into the income protection recently?
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yes, well, my, my accountant said it's tax deductible. You know, they told me to get it for a while, so I thought I might give it a go.
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, perfect. So imagine first time having a look into this realm of insurance.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Sorry.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : It's like your first time having a look into this type of insurance.
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I believe so, Yeah. Yeah.
[2 minutes][Agent] : Yeah, no, that's all right. Look, it's fairly straightforward in how it does all work there, but any questions you've got for me, fire away. I'm happy to answer for you there. And the way that we sort of do things, I'll run you through a bit of info on what it does cover and then we go through a duties based assessment. So that's going to go rather than just a job title, it'll go off your requirements, you know what you have to do at work. And from there we can actually build the quote up, you know, based off income and then just suit your needs as well. It's a fairly seamless process, I guess. While we are on the topic as well of it, what do you do for work?
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : I am manage the program part.
[2 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha. So like like you own a business in a sense.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Oh, perfect now.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : self-employed manager, have you?
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And how have you been doing that for ten years? Gotcha. And I imagine it has been like enjoyable. I imagine, I'm not too sure, like a cruisy kind of job or high stress. How's that been?
[2 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : No, it's pretty crazy.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I imagine. Of course it probably does have it's days, but for the most part it sounds like a good role. Beautiful. Whereabouts was that, if you don't mind me asking?
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : It sounds, uh, it's in the southwest, South Haven.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Oh, gotcha, yeah, nice sport game that way.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Southwest, Yeah.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : I've actually been through there a couple of months back, but yeah, no, not too bad, not too bad. Well look, we'll start bringing some stuff up in the background for you there mate, just so we can get you started. Now the main way this is being designed, it is of course to provide a monthly income benefit that's paid directly to you if you were unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you do suffer loss of income. So you know, they're to help keep food and I must have all the lights on, you know, while you're and recuperating and getting back into work. Now when it comes to I guess your circumstance is this, I want to know you have got a wife as well. I did chat with her a little earlier today. Was it just you 2 Do you have any children? What's the situation there?
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Two children, 17 and 14, 1417 and 14.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : 20 beautiful and how old were they and how much so oh got you. No, no, that's all right. So kind of done most of the hard yards I'd say, but still a couple of years left before a bit more free time.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : But no, I imagine wanting to make sure you know, they're running costs, you know, food, you know all those other sorts of things, school fees. Imagine, you know, amongst other bills and what not wanting to make sure that that's a flight as well there. Now what we offer, it'll be an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income. So starting from $1000 up to a maximum of 15,000 per month, but it will be salary dependent. Now once we've figured out sort of set terms what you want to choose for your cover, we then take you through some health and lifestyle questions over the phone. That's to check your approval and if so, on what terms. We can actually offer the cover now if you're happy with it once it's in place, that will protect you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Keep in mind there are some standard exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS, but nothing I believe you should have to worry about. It's mostly like if you engage in war or, you know, criminal activities, those sorts of things, which isn't, I don't think, a day-to-day activity for most people.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK, bye.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Now, as you are aware, your account is on top of it. We like to let people know the premiums or income protection are generally tax deductible. So definitely speak once it's all set up, definitely speak to your accountant about it. We'll be able to sort something out there. So far, I'll just check in. That's all making sense there.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, beautiful. OK, well let's bring this up here for you and we'll go to the duties based assessment. Now these will all just be yes or no responses and I have to let you know that before entering any of our questions, it is important you are aware of your duty to answer all of them accurately and honestly, just as failed to do so could impact your cover at claims time. Now the first one I'll just confirm with you. Do you work 15 hours or more per week? Yep. And is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment?
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I am the manager, but I do like things as well and stuff like that.
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : You do? Sorry, just put that for a SEC there. What was that? Gotcha. OK. So you would be, I guess, required to perform some physical duties there?
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : I I'm my my title manager, however I do outdoor activities as well as as as as well as any office really correct?
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, No, that's all right. We'll pop down yes if you spend the majority of the time indoors. But then the next question just asks, are you required to perform any physical duties? We'll pop down a yes for that one as well. Now the next question asks, do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle?
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yes. And then are you qualified, skilled or semi skilled or hold the required license to perform your role?
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Beautiful. I hope so of course as well. And then even though I know what you do, I just have to confirm. Do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew, Entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces. Or do you handle explosives? And I thank goodness for that. And do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights above 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul?
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : No. Perfect. OK, that's everything there. Now we can start building up the quote. Just as it wouldn't have transferred from online. I'll just reconfirm it there. Simon, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? No beautiful. Very healthy choice there. Umm, Now the next thing we'll determine will be the maximum of monthly benefit that we could provide you, uh, obviously whilst off work per month. We do that based off of your annual income before tax. So I presume you would be self-employed there, correct?
[7 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : No, Correct.
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. What would classify as your pre tax income? It'll be your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts, less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. So essentially the amount that the business would otherwise cease earning In the event you are unable to work due to a disability, What would you say your annual income before tax would be?
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK. So we got distributed income from the trust. So I think last year was about 120. It's about 120 to $150,005.
[8 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : 120 to 150, did you say?
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, Yeah.
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, what we can do because it look, it does get reassessed at claims time of course, but we can pop an average in there like between that figure or whatever you'd like, whatever you'd feel comfortable popping in.
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Well, we'll stick it at 1:20 and we'll see what I think, yeah.
[9 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. We'll start at 1:20. So based off of that, as I mentioned, minimum is $1000 per month, maximum for you would be $7000 per month based off of 120,000 between those bottom and top figures.
[9 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : The top.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Is there any way you'd like to have a look at this top?
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : The top on.
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, of course, we'll pop it at 7000 for you there. And then the next two things you'll get to decide on the waiting period and benefit. Now the waiting period is just a non payment period that must be served before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. The two options here will either be 30 days or 90 days. And just to keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears, similar to how like a normal employer would pay you after your sick time off. It works the same way with this. As an example, if you choose a 30 day waiting period, the first payment is going to be 60 days from when you were first eligible to claim between 30 and 90. Summer. Which one did you want me to choose?
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Probably 30.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : 30? We can start at 30. Obviously before anything's final, we can have a look around at the different terms. And then lastly is just the benefit. This one's pretty self-explanatory, but the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness.
[10 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep, probably just for six months.
[10 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : The options here are either six months, one year, two years or five years, six months. Yeah, easy. OK, we'll pop that there. Now that's everything that we can do for now. The next step is to take you through the health and lifestyle questions as the price and any terms of the cover. They are determined on the outcome of these questions. They only take a couple of minutes usually. I think the quickest one I've done all that was 5 minutes. So hoping we can have the same run there now as you are, I believe an existing customer with the life insurance there. We've already got some contact details. I'll just confirm that they're all up to date as well. I've got your e-mail hereitwasjustsfenix77@gmail.com. Perfect. And then we've got your home address. It was 674 Buria Rd.
[11 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, correct.
[11 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : in Buria, NSW 2540 perfect.
[11 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, correct. Yeah.
[11 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : And then the PO Box was just 277 in Nowra, NSW 2541 perfect. OK. That way if you get approved for the cover, you're happy with it all. We can get you set up a course and have the full documentation sent out to you to have a thorough read through. Now I'll just need to read out a short statement to you. It's called a pair underwriting disclosure. This is basically the same application you would have gone through for life insurance, so I'll read that out.
[12 minutes][Customer] : OK.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : If you agree and understand we can jump straight into the application so just says here. And as a reminder, please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes.

[13 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yes. OK, beautiful. These questions fairly fairly straightforward. I'll just need to read the net to you in full first. I'll then just ask yes or no, respond accordingly. We should be able to fly right through them.

[14 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And has your business been profitable?
[14 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[14 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. Now the next question is asking if you were to become disabled and unable to work, would your business continue to generate income for more than 60 days?
[14 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yes, with with. Maybe I've employed someone to take my post, don't you?
[14 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK. So like like yeah, I guess it is obviously a bit of a tricky hypothetical question of course as well. But it is in that event, I guess if you were to become you know completely unable to or you know not completely but unable to work for an extended period of time if the business is still going to generate income for over 60 or past that 60 day point.
[15 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Ye, yeah, it should.

This next section is just in relation to your height and weight. So we just need to make sure that we do capture a confident single figure measurement for each one. Starting off first there, Simon, what is your exact height? Either centimetres or feet and inches will do. So either exact or if you remember the last time you had it checked.

Or are you awaiting results for any medical tests or investigations such as but not limited to any surgeries, X-rays, scans, blood tests, or biopsy, yes or no?
[29 minutes][Customer] : Can you say that again?
[29 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, no, you're alright mate. I'll break it down into, because it's a pretty lengthy question, I'll break it down into two parts here. So this is other than what you've already told me about anything we haven't covered yet in the past three years only have you sought medical advice or treatment by a medical practitioner or specialist, Yes or no?
[29 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, the this is not what we're not covered before. Is this what you're saying?

And then the second part to that, are you awaiting results for any medical tests or investigations such as but not limited to any surgeries, X-rays, scans, blood tests or biopsy? No, perfect. All right, we'll pop down a note for that one. I don't know why they didn't break it into two parts because the amount of people that are like, hold on a minute.

[30 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : But it, yeah, it's being captured. It's being covered under. Yeah. Perfect. No, that's alright mate.
[30 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[30 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Now the next one here is just confirming other than what you've already told me about. Are you contemplating seeking medical advice for any symptoms you are currently experiencing within the next two weeks?
[30 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : No.
[30 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : No, beautiful. And last one for this section here, other than what you've already told me about, Have you ever during your working career required more than two consecutive weeks off work due to illness or injury? Perfect. OK, that's all you have questions done. We've only got 3 left. The next two are just about your family history. So to the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family living or deceased ever been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, Huntington's disease or familial Adamatis polyposis?
[30 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : No.
[30 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. OK. And then this one here is asking, to the best to your knowledge, have any of your immediate family suffered from cancer, heart condition, stroke or other hereditary disease prior to the age of 60?
[31 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : For the 69th.
[31 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : No beautiful pop down over there. And the last one is just confirming how much of A thrill seeker you are. So it asks, other than one of events like a gift certificate or voucher, do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fare paying passenger on a recognised airline? Motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering here, AB sailing, scuba diving deeper than 40 meters, cave or wreck diving or any other hazardous activity. Yes or no?
[31 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No.
[31 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : No, Perfect. Bit too dangerous in my opinion. Sounds fun. But yeah, you know, I'm a bit of a horse when it comes to that stuff. All right, that is everything done and dusted there. I appreciate you coming to that application with me as well. It just means we have got everything laid out on the table for you in terms of what we can cover you for. So let's bring this up here and have a look. OK? Sorry my internet's been so slow today. Perfect. OK, so the good news there, Simon, the application has been approved. It does just have some new terms given obviously medical history that we've now applied to that. So I'll run through this with you here. The maximum benefit amount and the maximum benefit. Have been capped. So for the Max benefit, we can only look at $5000 as a maximum. It was that's what we're looking for 4/7. So it's just under 2000 or just 2000 less and the benefit. Is capped at two years. Now those are due to the fact of having diabetes, a history of diabetes debt.
[32 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[32 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Obviously when it comes to benefit. That's not impacting because we're only looking at six months. It's obviously just the monthly benefit that that's been adjusted there.
[32 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[32 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Now the next two things will be under the exclusions. So the first one, it comes under self-employed business continuity. It says the income protection benefit will be reduced by any income you receive or are entitled to receive from any business you have an interest in subsequent to the disablement debt. This adjustment will only apply where the total amount of the benefit payable plus the ongoing income exceeds 70% of your pre disability income. OK, that's the first exclusion there.
[33 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Didn't get that very well, but.
[33 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So essentially because no, no, that's alright. So the, the way I'm trying to figure out the best way to explain this, the way that our income protection is designed is that let's say you know, as an example, you had two income protections in place, right? What we're going to pay up, we cannot exceed 70% of your pre tax income monthly just given the way that it's designed there. So if you were to receive other disability payments from other sources and it only goes up to let's say 50%, we're just going to add on that extra 20% to make it up to the total of 70%. So it's similar with the business there as well. Whatever income you'd receive, we're just going if it exceeds 70%, obviously we can't pay that in that sense. But if it's under 70% of your normal monthly income or pre tax income, we'll then just you know, add to the total of making it up to 70%.
[34 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. Yeah.
[34 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, Beautiful.
[34 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Bye bye.
[34 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : It is a bit, yeah. The wording sometimes is a bit tricky as well. It confuses me too. Now the other exclusion that did just pop up was obviously for the history of diabetes as well. It is a bit of a tricky 1 to get covered now. It just says that no benefit will be payable for any disability, condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to or arising from diabetes type one or two including any disease or disorder of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular system. And then lastly, there is just a premium adjustment 1 due to diabetes, but two also 2 currently having fatty liver as well. So we'll jump back out of here and have a look. Now to recap, the Max monthly benefit we can look at for you is 5000, of course, with a waiting period of 30 days and a benefit period of six months. You are looking at a fortnightly premium of $129 for the income protection with an approval there.
[35 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : OK. That's per month. Is it per Fort?
[35 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Hi do you, oh sorry, are you looking monthly? Yes, that was per fortnight.
[35 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : That's OK, Yeah, alright.
[35 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Do you prefer monthly as a frequency?
[35 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Oh no, it doesn't really bother me, but I just umm, yeah, that's good or not alright, umm. So would you rather send me this in an e-mail and I'll get back to you on whether I want to proceed?
[35 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Well, I'd like to discuss obviously the options that we do have available for you there, Simon. There are some other things too that are included in the policy and also how it works which would be good to take into consideration there as well. Now we do include a rehabilitation benefit out in the policy along with a final expenses benefit. Now the final expenses, it's very similar to what you've got in the life insurance. This one pays out $10,000 in the event that you were to pass away to beneficiaries of your choice there. So another inbuilt funeral policy for you. And then the last thing to mention is just how the premiums do work now they are stepped, meaning that they will generally increase each year as you age, again similar to the life insurance just based off of that risk with age.
[36 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : None.
[36 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Now to give you an in indication here, this is if you made no changes to the policy and left everything the same, you'd be looking next year at a fortnightly premium of $139.69 per fortnight. OK, OK. And if you do as well to get curious, you can find more information about our premium structure on our website there. Now some things I did want to discuss with you.
[37 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[37 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Now given the fact of obviously fatty liver, it is something that people can come back from, I believe and we understand that those things may change in the future too. That exclusion or not, sorry, no exclusion that premium adjustment has been applied due to the fatty liver. That's not permanent assignment. So obviously if you were to take the policy out, it is going to apply for the time being. Well, let's say down the track, obviously you get things back on track, you recover from that and you've obviously been symptom free for a fair bit there might think maybe six months to a year, Could it even be less? You can simply give us a call and apply to have that reviewed as well in hopes for obviously getting that changed and taking that premium adjustment off as well.
[37 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[37 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So that's not something that's permanent either there, right? Just to give you full transparency as well, we try to be as flexible as we can with our customers, especially when it comes to things that we don't know the future of as well. Now, the other things I wanted to discuss was actually in terms of the policy. I understand it will be something to consider. Obviously, you want to have a chat with your wife as well. I imagine your account in there too. Now, the options we do have is I can get some information sent out to you today just via a quote. It'll just be some of the general information that we've gone over today.
[38 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[38 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : The other alternative that we would have for you if you were liking the sounds of it and obviously I know want to be able to read through it in full. We can actually arrange to have the full documentation sent out to you via e-mail today, obviously via post in the next couple of business days. But that way it actually allows you to read through your tailored documents in full. And if you want to run that by your account, you can as well. It also provides you with the immediate protection as well. So the policy does technically start for you, but you're not required to make any payments upfront either. Uh, we do allow our customers to select their first payment date within the next 30 days. And then from whatever day you've chosen, you then get provided a further 30 days as a calling off. Just to make sure that it is the right thing for you there. So even if you've made a payment, something doesn't suit right or you just feel that you want to cancel the policy, you can simply give us a call and go through those steps, apply to cancel. And if you do so within that. You'll get a refund of your premiums paid unless a claim has been made.
[39 minutes][Customer] : None. OK, yeah, yeah, I want to think about it, but yeah, if you could send me the information I'll have a think about it.
[39 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : No.
[39 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : I did. I did ring up a a 11 more another company and the the premium was a lot less.
[39 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Was that with an approval as well?
[39 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : But yes, but I'll I'm I'll just not with it. I have an approval yet.
[39 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Right.
[39 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : No, not with an approval, but that's just a a quote.
[39 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So I haven't been through the application there.
[39 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : No, not a just a quick quote over the phone.
[39 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : No, no, no, that's OK. I just didn't know. Obviously I get a bit curious about other competitors. Of course, don't have to tell me who it was, that's fine. But more so if it has been with an approval there. Look, you are more than welcome to take as much time as you do need to think about it because I understand you know wanting to find a good rate of course for yourself. That's something that does provide a substantial amount of protection there. If I may ask Simon, obviously from our end, was there any concerns or anything to think about for you there?
[40 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : No, it's just a bit bit more than I expected. That'll be pay, payment order. Everything else seems fine. But yeah, it's just a bit more than what I thought it'd be costly.
[40 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : More so coming down to the cost, yeah, Yeah, No, look, it is understandable there as I said, you know that well, I guess the one only sort of main premium adjustment, it does go based off of your goal at work as well. So your requirements, what you know has to do that always goes into calculation as well as the periods you know selected. So waiting period, benefit. You've chosen the cheaper option, there being six months waiting period to let you know cheaper options, 90 days as well, but it depends on how long you feel that you could go without a payment, of course. So I don't blame you on choosing the 30 days. Now what we'll be able to do from here, Simon, I'll give you some time to go over that.
[40 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Umm.
[40 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : If you do want to go through the application with the other provider, see what they do come out with as well. That way obviously you can compare apples for apples as well with the actual coverage provided, what's included, what's not included.
[41 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[41 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : I'm going to send out what's called a pre activation policy schedule for you. So it'll be a little bit more in depth information to read through via e-mail. It does also allow you to purchase the policy or activate that cover through the e-mail there too. So if it's outside of business hours or just can't be bothered giving a call in, you've got that option as well and it will be password protected just with your date of birth in the formative day monthly. So you should get that soon anyway. Obviously across the way. Can I imagine you do a bit of rating bit of chatting as well? I would like to follow up on this myself just because obviously I've taken you through everything. We try and keep it. You speak with the same person each time. I'd like to pop a call back in for you there. Is there a day next week? I'm not too sure obviously your working schedule as well. That would be suitable to get in touch with you there.
[41 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : If you can give me the the other company said they're going to get back to me within 10 working days.
[42 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Alright.
[42 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : I wanna wait for the decision sort of thing. Yeah, if you can give me a call after that, that would be great.
[42 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Also, so just I'm more so curious, 10 working days, is that like to just run through the quote with you?
[42 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Or no, that's just to prove the I don't know. The I don't know what they bought it. The I don't know. Oh, it's yeah, just to approve it.
[42 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : No, like the underwriting or something.
[42 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, it's underwriter.
[42 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Oh, so they had to send theirs off, did they?
[42 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Go to the underwriter or something, She said yes, that happens.
[42 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha. No, no, that's OK because yeah, we do have a bit of a similar process as well. But obviously depending, I guess, you know, the questions being asked, those sorts of things there too.
[42 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[42 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha. No, look, that's OK What we'll do. So when was that completed?
[42 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Umm, I'm gonna, I'm still I'll turn the form out now with the the other company and then they said 10 business days they'll get back to me.
[43 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha. No, no, that's all right. But it's just I'm just having a look here. So I guess we don't turn out today. So what's that about there? Maybe in two weeks time on the Friday the 20th of September, I can give you a call and obviously we can review things, but hopefully by then you've heard from them.
[43 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, yeah, for sure.
[43 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. And is there generally a good time? I'm just trying to think because our operating hours are 8:00 AM to 8:00 PMI don't know exactly what time I'll be on that day. I can pop it in for around midday. That way I'll definitely be on no matter what shift come put on.
[43 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, any time. That's fine.
[43 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, easy down. Look, I'll pop that in for you there around 12:30 on the Friday. We'll catch up, see how things do go at that point for you, OK?
[43 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, No worries. I appreciate the time. Thank you.
[43 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : No, no, of course we appreciate your time, especially on a Friday there mate. But it is a nice day at least where we are in Sydney. So go out and enjoy the rest of the good weather and the weekend ahead.
[44 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : No worries. You too. Thank you. Bye.
[44 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Hey Jake, what's your weather now? Hey, you done mate, Cheers. Bye.
