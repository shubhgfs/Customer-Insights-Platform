[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Now, the levels of cover you can apply for, they range from $100,000 up to $750,000. Now I know you would have heard that, but I want to confirm, are you happy with $100,000 of the life insurance for yourself?
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So the life insurance on its own was $16.26 per fortnight and then we have TPD included in there at $50,000. So you can choose cover from $50,000 up to 100,000. Now there is the quote there for $50,000 of the total and permanent disability and it's $17.37 per fortnight on its own. So that was a total fortnightly premium together of $33.63. Is that OK with you Lindsay? Perfect. So with our life insurance, it is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones. Now we need to a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. Now this could be used to help them pay a full mortgage, loans, maintain their lifestyle and any other costs involved in raising a family. So it is basically there to give it the Peace of Mind that if something happened to you, your family would have that financial security and you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Now to apply for cover, we just ask you some health and lifestyle questions over the phone to see if you are approved. If you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months. In addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, we'll pay your claim in full and the money could be used for medical costs, et cetera, to ensure that you receive the best care possible. And then we also include a $10,000 advance payment to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. Now we have a real reward attached to the policy. So following your first policy and a first free date, we'll refund you 10% of the premiums you paid in that time. So $87.44 is what to get back. And we do also send out a freewheel kit value that's $30.00 with the policy as well.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Ah, hi, hi.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Now your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. You can opt out of this automatic indexation each year. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $39.70 per fortnight. That's with your benefit amount raising to $105,000 for life insurance and $52,500 for TPD. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. Did you have any questions at all? I've gone through a fair bit of information there. Lindsay, did you have any questions? Thank you.

And it'll able to return to work in any field in which you're experienced, educated or trained. Or if you would have suffered loss of independent existence. There is an exclusion under this cover for any intentional self-inflicted injury. Please also be aware that any payment made the total and permanent disability cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount. If you also purchase serious illness cover, the serious illness benefit amount will also be reduced. So it will also reduce when you have a successful TPD claim. So as I mentioned that TPD on there at $50,000, that was $17.36 per fortnight. Are you happy for me to add this optional cover to your quote, Lindsay?
[9 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : How much? All them $33.
