[2 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Thanks. Thanks.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Hey Amy, thanks for holding. Umm, So yeah, in terms of the, uh, prediction, I have gotten up to 70, the age of 70 for you. So keep in mind it is pretty far down the track. So just an estimate. Umm, And that's what, that's what, $2,000,000 of cover as well. So if, if you, you know, hopefully live a long and healthy life, of course, but at the age of 70, umm, you're looking at a monthly premium of $4743.40. So that's what it's projected to be.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, No, that's what I just wanted to sort of get an example of. Does it Rampart work ridiculously?
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : And that's what that's what, 2 million dollars of cover, OK, Yeah, of course, Yeah, of course.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So you like you're paying $1,000,000 off in the last three years or something?
[6 minutes][Agent] : As, as, as you get older, yeah, yeah. Just because the age is a uh yeah, of course it's a risk factor. Just as it goes up, uh, as you, as, as you get older, that risk goes up as well. Umm, so that is in place, You know, keep in mind that the policy is there for, umm, you know, if something were to happen before that as well, of course.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yes.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah.
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : No, it's more the, you know, Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : And, and, yeah, sorry it's about to cut you off, but yeah, I was gonna say if, even if it does get too much, if you feel like at the age of 70, you don't need $2,000,000 of cover, umm, you're free to drop that down to whatever amount you'd like. So, yeah, there's no, there's no risk, you know, restrictions or anything like that. Umm, it's very simple process. If you wanted to reduce it, you can scroll up and apply to do that as well.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So there is, there's that flexibility as well in the future.
