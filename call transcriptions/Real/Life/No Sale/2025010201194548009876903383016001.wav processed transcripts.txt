[37 seconds][Agent] : Umm, sorry, my colleague was explaining to me you're wanting to set up a funeral policy for both of your parents, is that correct?
[43 seconds][Customer] : Life insurance.
[46 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so we wouldn't be able to set up a life insurance for them unless I went through the actual, umm, cover with them directly.
[44 seconds][Customer] : Life insurance.
[55 seconds][Agent] : Umm, if you're wanting to set up cover for them, umm, was it life or funeral cover that you're looking at for them?
[55 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. Oh, it's life, I think.
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Because it is the funeral cover that my colleague has quoted you on there, That's all.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. What?
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, well, let me go through it all with you.
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : What does that entail, people?
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Umm, perfect. Now, just before I do any of that, I've got your father's profile here, so I just want to just double check that. What's your father's first and last name, please?
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No, I thought that's all for one.
[1 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And his date of birth.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : The last 15th of August 5th, 1952.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thanks, Tommy. And can I just confirm that your father is an Australian resident?
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Ah, yes.
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for that. Excellent. So please say all our calls are recorded. Any advice or providers generally make sure may not be suitable to your situation. So I'm gonna jump into that and just explain how the cover works. If you do have any questions as I go through, just let me know and I'm more than happy to answer your questions. Now. This cover is designed to provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to your loved ones when they pass away.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Now this money can be used not only for funeral expenses but also any other final expenses like unpaid bills. And your parents will be up to nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount. Perfect. If that issued to an accident, the chosen benefit will triple. It is easy to apply. There's no medical checks for this cover, so as long as they're an Australian resident, age between 40 and 79 is a guaranteed acceptance for them. Now just so you know as well, for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months, you will be covered for death due to any cause.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, alright.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit as well, which means after holding the policy for 12 months, if you're first like that's the terminal illness for 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, we can actually pay that claim out in full while they're still alive and they can use that money however they need to. Told me. Do you have any questions in regards to any of that so far? Alright, perfect. Now I'm just gonna go with that pricing with you again. Now, before I do that, I do wanna let you know you can choose between 3000 up to 15,000 in cover and your premiums are designed to stay the same there as your parents get older. Also when they reach the age of 85, those premiums are going to cease. So there'll be enough more to pay, but that cover will continue right up until the day before their 100th birthday. So you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. And Tommy, we've also got an early cash out option available with the cover as well.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : No, not at this point, no, I do OK.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So anytime after they reach 85 years of age, they can choose to end their cover and we can we will pay them 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. OK. Do you have any questions in regards to any of that?
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, just in regards to like say, how fast would you get the money?
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, no, that's a fantastic question there. Let me just pull that up now in terms of how fast takes for a claim to be processed, it's generally within one business day on receipt of the completed claim form and supporting documents. We understand it is a difficult time, so we do like to get it out rather quickly there to them.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, that's, that's all I wanted to know.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Perfect.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : That's that's that's good enough.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yep, perfect. Well, let's jump in and we'll go through that quote. Yeah. My colleague quoted you for $8000 of cover for each your mom and your dad. Is that right? Is that what you're looking at? Yeah. So that's what you would get if anything would have happened there. Yeah.
