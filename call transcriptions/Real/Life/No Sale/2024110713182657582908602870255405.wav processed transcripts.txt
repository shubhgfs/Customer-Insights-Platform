[4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Hello. Hi, Barbara. It's Anthony from Real Insurance. Following up with you, man. How are you?
[12 seconds][Customer] : Hello, I dropped out yesterday. Yeah.
[19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we did. We. I'm not sure what happened there. I'm so sorry, umm, umm, for that, uh, just a freak accident there. But, uh, Barbara, please that all calls are recorded and any advice we provide is generally nature may not be suitable to your situation. We can get back to where we were. Umm, just needed you to confirm your first name, last name and date of birth again.
[38 seconds][Customer] : Barbara and I have a ring 41234.
[43 seconds][Agent] : Now your middle name is a mandatory on our side of things. Do you want me to include it or just have it as first and last name?
[49 seconds][Customer] : Oh just first e-mail.
[51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[51 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[52 seconds][Agent] : And November, of course. You are a female Australian resident. Yes or no? OK, lovely. So let's start with your postal address. I didn't get to get that down. What was your post code out there for the physical copy to come out? Yep. And then what was the, uh, postal address, please?
[56 seconds][Customer] : Yes, 5008 Unit 21A Cavendish Ave., Devon Park.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yep, here it is. Beautiful SA, of course. Yep. All righty. OK, so let's bring that back up here for you now levels of cover, you can choose $10,000 up to $100,000. Uh, we looked at the 20,000 for you and that was manageable for you for now at $87.06 for that, correct.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, all that's left to do to go to the health and lifestyle questions now, it'll take about 5 minutes and if you're approved, we'll get that one sorted for you over the phone. But again, please, not all calls are recorded and any advice we provide is generally in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. I'll recap how it all works for you too, just to refresh your memory. Really easy to apply for, ask you to serve a yes or no questions over the phone today and that will determine your approval. And Barbara, if you are accepted and once you commence the policy for the 1st 12 months, you'll be covered for accidental death only for the 1st 12 months to be covered for death due to any cause. In addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we'll pay out your claim in full to help with the medical costs and to ensure you receive the best care possible. And this policy will give you a 20. Sorry. This policy will cover you for a 20 year term or until the 85th birthday, whichever occurs first. And at this time a life insurance benefit expires. Your premiums will cease but and your cover will automatically convert converts to a final expenses benefit, which is 20% of your life insurance. Madam covers you for a further 10 years and if you were to pass away an additional cost to you during this 10 years, you also have an option to cash out half the final expenses benefit and then your policy altogether. As far as the features there, Barbara, again, does that make sense?
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. And keep in mind as well, and I've told you before, your premium is steps, which means it will increase each year. I'll just give you an indication again. So we're all on the same page as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $88.80 a fortnight. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website, but we'll go ahead and answer those questions now and see how you do. I'm going to read you a small free underwriting disclosure statement to frame the questions up first. So bear with me, just ask. I will just read.
