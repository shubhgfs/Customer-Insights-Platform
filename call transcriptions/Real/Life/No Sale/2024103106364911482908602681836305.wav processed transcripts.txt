[17 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no. It's just an abusive relationship.
[17 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I'm so sorry. OK, so if your condition, I'll put it under one of these, we'll find it.
[17 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[17 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : The first grouping for you is depression, anxiety, personal depression or stress, including post traumatic stress disorder. The next one's anorexia and advisor or bulimia. The next one's ADHD and the last ones or IDD and the last ones other mental illness. Can I put it under the depression?
[18 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, whatever you think. Whatever you think is best because it's just Danny, because I was dealing with a lot with my son's father.
[18 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, now we, we of course, of course, of course.
[18 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[18 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Well, you said depression, so I'll put it under the depression, anxiety, postal depression or stress, including the post traumatic stress disorder. OK, So all under the same grouping. Yeah. OK.
[18 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, Yep.
[18 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Now how many episodes have you had which required treatment? So you can do 1223 to 4-5 to six O 7 plus.
[18 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : When you say treatment, what do you mean by that?
[18 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Let me bring that up here and I'll show you. No, that's OK because that's quite common. People ask me that too. Yep, Yep. That's OK.
[18 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Sorry I'm on a, I'm on a depressant but I haven't wanted to go kill myself or anything.
[18 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : No, no, that's fine. That's fine.
[18 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : It's just having to deal with it.
[18 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. OK, let me look.
[18 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Pretty crappy time of my life to be honest.
[18 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : I can imagine. So let me read this out and it'll make a lot more sense for you because a lot of people ask me this.
[18 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[18 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So an episode for us is an event occurrence, a reoccurrence of symptoms with increased severity from normal mood. I usually require either medical, medical intervention, referral, treatment or alteration adjustment to the existing maintenance treatment. Treatment can take the form of medication and or counseling or therapy. So that's what treatment is. So I'll read this out. So someone has a mental health symptoms that's required treatment these days an episode. Now, if they return to the doctor several times to monitor the situation and offer repeat prescriptions, this would be the same single episode. If, however, they have a relapse of the symptoms worsen and treatment needs to be changed or increased, and this would constitute a second episode.
[19 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[19 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : And similarly, if the applicant recovered, the treatment stops and the applicant is fine by that later date, they sent his return and I have to go back to the doctors, seek further advice. This would be a separate episode. So is it the one episode that's gone along? You just gone along to the doctors for your prescription and to chat about that.
[19 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Every now and then it just relapses a bit. I've had a few things happen in my life and just, you know.
[20 minutes][Agent] : So is it still the same that you're just going along to chat with him about that and you're on the same medication as well? I'm so sorry.
[20 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Well, I've had two sisters pass away, so I've yeah, sorry. Yeah. So that's probably, probably a little bit more into it.
[20 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So as your medication changed. All right.
[20 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I'm, I'm on the normal medication. I just, I go off it for a little bit and then I just I'm fine. And then OK, I was abused.
[20 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah.
[20 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : I don't know if you need to stop recording on this one, but I had.
[20 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : No, no, no, no, no, Elizabeth, I don't actually need you to disclose it.
[20 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah, that's right.
[20 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : I just want to see if I can get the episodes correct for you because I don't want to over the I don't want to over say it. Yeah.
[20 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : I think it's been 3 * 3 times.
[20 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So because when you're saying so when it says if you have so this it says If however, you have a relapse on the symptoms worse than all your treatment needs to be changed, right or in or increase and this would constitute it a second episode. So I'm trying to figure out if you'd like me to do it as one to two or because she said your medication hasn't changed.
[20 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no.
[21 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Or do you want it to be a three to 4-5 to six or seven plus?
[21 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Well, maybe you just wanted to, because it really hasn't changed I guess.
[21 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, yeah. OK. Now, was it more than one episode? We'll say yes because you reckon it's more like 2. Is that right? Mm, hmm.
[21 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : When you say episode though, like look, I've been doing counselling on and off for years.
[21 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Hmm. Mm.
[21 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : But it's not, it's only when something triggers it, I guess. When like like I said, and I know you don't want me to go into it, but I, I was abused and then my sister passed away and then 20 years later my sister passed away.
[21 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, I get it. I get it.
[21 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : So, so it's sort of that's the only thing.
[21 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Doing your treatment. Yeah. So.
[21 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : That's the only reason why I keep, you know, Yeah, basically.
[21 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So.
[21 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : But it's not like I have to do it for a long period of time. It's like I go, they explain to me, yeah, all good. And it's. Yeah. Anyway, yeah. I don't think it's the episode. No, I haven't been able to not work, you know, I mean it. I I don't think it's been an episode at all. I've always been able to go to work.
[21 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So what you're thinking of is more treatment, not an episode, because an episode can go, because an episode can go for a long period of time and you can still be just yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I've always been able to live life. But it's just still a depression.
[22 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So do you want to leave it as do you want to leave it as just the one? Then you've gone along, you've had a chat, you've had an episode. OK. All right.
[22 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think so.
[22 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yep. All right.
[22 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. I know how to live with it, if you know what I mean.
[22 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, that's OK.
[22 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : It's not like I don't know how to live with it.
[22 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's all right. Because see some people and I'll give you an example, all right?
[22 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[22 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Umm, some people can and have an episode, something major or whatever can happen and then they can be going along for treatment for, you know, 10 years and it's still the same episode.
[22 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Oh, you know.
[22 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : They're going along letting medication and having some counseling, but it's still the same episode.
[22 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK.
[22 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So I don't want to over disclose. Yeah.
[22 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Alright. At the end of the day, probably. No, nothing. Then I've. I've gone.
[22 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So I'll do one. I'll do one.
[22 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : What do you want?
[22 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Because you did go along to your doctors. Yeah.
[22 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK. Yeah. Fair enough. We'll go on.
[22 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So now you said you're still on your medication. So have you had symptoms or treatment for this condition within the last six months?
