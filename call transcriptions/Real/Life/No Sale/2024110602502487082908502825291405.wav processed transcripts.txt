[26 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much.
[27 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.

[28 seconds][Customer] : You will.
[30 seconds][Agent] : All right. So, uh, Mary and we've, I, I gave you a quick explanation of the design of our cover.
[36 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[35 seconds][Agent] : Umm, it's very easy to apply. It's a series of health and lifestyle questions over the phone to see if you are approved.
[43 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[42 seconds][Agent] : So if you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause.
[50 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[49 seconds][Agent] : The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months. In addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we will pay your claim in full. So the money could be used for same medical costs to ensure that you receive the best care possible. And we also included $10,000 advance payment. This is to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses of the time generally paid out within 24 to 48 hours for promiseable of supporting documents. And your family will also receive umm, our condolences in way of flowers and a personal note from us letting them know that we're here to support them. So we'll have a dedicated claims, UMM agent that will be there to represent them and help them through all of that.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Within 24 hours Cos this is the thing we took out hubby's insurance with you guys maybe 18 months ago. But we've kept funeral cover Cos suddenly I I just never cancelled it.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Sorry.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : But we've recently lost my nephew and this has made the entire family re look at everything because we all thought that he was covered and it turns out he wasn't. So he's left a very young family. So these are the awful conversations that you've got to have.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yes, yeah, no. And I mean, it's something I often, you know, I have, I have these conversations very often, obviously working in the role that I do. So I understand exactly, you know what you mean in terms of, you know, tragedy. And then it prompts us to think about these things. So, umm, everyone's always looking for Peace of Mind, right? Ultimately, that's what this comes down to.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, absolutely.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So we'll see if we can do that.
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Righto.
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Umm, no. And yet. So with the the time frame, the it's 24 to 48 hours upon receivable of supporting documents.
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, it's general.
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So we, we aim to have that out as soon as possible.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Now we'll have a look at some pricing. We'll find what's gonna suit.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Oh, sure.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Now have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? No. Very good.
[2 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : No, quit 12 years ago.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Alright, we can have Oh really?
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : You're not wrong.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : We're gonna have before, but too expensive that I'd say very expensive now. So we can have a look to cover anywhere from 100,000 up to 750,000. So what benefit amount would you like for me to quote you on?
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : 6:50 please.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Sure. 6:50 So that comes to a fortnightly premium of $106.30, which are quite still only $7.59 per day.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Uh, we do also include a real reward. So following your first policy anniversary date, we will refund you 10% of the premiums that you've paid in that time. So you will get back $276.37 as a refund after the 12 month period. But would that be affordable for you, $106.30 per fortnight?
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Oh yes, 'cause if I'm successful in this, we're actually cancelling that funeral cover that we've got, and we pay currently $40 a fortnight on that, so we're good.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, All right. So if you are replacing an existing policy, we just recommend that you do not cancel it until the application has been approved and you have reviewed this policy in full as it may not be identical to existing cover.
[4 minutes][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[4 minutes][Agent] : You should also consider the benefits that may not apply or waiting periods that may start again. But I'll take you through. We'll check to see if you're eligible.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : If you're eligible, I'll get the documentation sent out for you to start reviewing and, and doing everything you need to do Umm, now we do also send you out a free will kit which is valued at $30.00 with the policy, so you can create a will for some additional Peace of Mind.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Uh, your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year is your age. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will increase by 5% for you with associated increases in premium designed to try to keep up with the rising cost of living for you and your family. You do get made known a month prior to these changes each year and you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year depending on what you prefer the time. But as an indication, so if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $124.90 per fortnight benefit amount then being $682,500.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. I think with with with hubby, we didn't get in early enough. He can't sort of just we have to wait now for that to come across the next year, don't we like you have to what's the word?
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : And you can each year that increases or you can apply to increase, but it's subject to eligibility criteria at the time. So it depends.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : No, no, not increase it is what I'm saying to you.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : So he's yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : I mean, he you can opt out of it indefinitely as well if he doesn't want the increase.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Like we, we've set it so this 650 we've worked out covers him and his is because he's got superannuation and stuff that I don't have. That's why mine is higher. But his So what what I'm basically saying to you is we don't want that.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Hmm, That's what we want. I'm done. Thank you.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : We're setting this as what we want and don't see a point in it increasing.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Oh, sure.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes. Mm, hmm.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Well, look, if you, umm, wanna opt out of that indefinitely, that's something you call the support team for and you can either allow it to go ahead each year and and come or, sorry, come about each year and you can opt out of it. Umm, or you can choose to opt out indefinitely. That's up to you. Yep. Umm.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : And Yep, indefinitely, OK, sure.
