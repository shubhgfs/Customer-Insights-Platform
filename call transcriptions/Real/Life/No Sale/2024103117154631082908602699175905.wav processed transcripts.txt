[1 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. No problem.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : All righty. That is also a terminally ill advanced payment included with the cover as well. What that means that at any time she holds the policy, if she was diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner then obviously this situation we will pay the whole life insurance benefit amount to her while she's alive.

[6 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, uh, now in terms of the premise, you need just also let you know you might know this already, but it says that your premium is step, which is it will generally increase each year the age. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each of your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. However, you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year if you wish. So each year you had that option.
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, alrighty.
[6 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll give you an example as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $125.99 a fortnight, but your benefit amount would have gone up to $525,000.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, but like I said, each year you can just calling the party to decline that automatic indexation if you wish.

[22 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Hey, Jim.
[22 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Hello. Yep.
[22 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Hey man. All right. So everything's, uh, going smoothly. Just one thing, obviously, about a deviated system is either one of past the underwriters, umm, just because it wasn't the list of common things. OK, But everything else is good. Umm, once it comes back from the underwriters and this, it's, uh, fully approved, no changes made from that point onwards, I can accept the policy on the behalf. And what would happen is she'd be covered under the terms and conditions from that point onwards. You'll get an e-mail copy of the full policy details and a hard copy as well. And uh, all she needs to do is fill out the beneficiaries from it, attached sign that it's in the back. The first payment date though we let you choose a date in the future as the first payment date. And from that day we do give you a 30 day cooling off. So just in case you change your mind, we can refund the premiums if paid unless the claim has been made.
[22 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[23 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK umm, but with the first payment date you said you obviously look after all of that.
[23 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : I don't know, mid next month or something.
[23 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : What date did you want to select as the first payment date next month?
[23 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[23 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, so if I change this to like I said, this is fortnightly, we can do monthly or yearly as well. If you want me to put mid next month, I can change this to a monthly and put it for, uh, the 14th of March. So we can only stretch to that, you know, 30 days maximum. But it still gives a, gives you a piece of mind which is covered from today under the terms and conditions, but nothing comes out to the 14th of March. Does that sound fair?
[23 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's right. I, I was actually just taking a quote from the CS and CS so I could have a look at them. I don't actually need to Sign up today. I just wanted to get a quote to see what it was going to cost me instead.
[23 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, right.
[23 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : So Yep, that'll be good.
[23 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, So look, obviously we can send out an e-mail, the link to the piece, uh, can send out a link to the PDS and the pricing with an e-mail. We can definitely do that for you. Look, all turn it to be the because she's been approved. What we're offer to do is cover under the terms and conditions to come once it comes back from the underwriters and, uh, during this time, you can still have a chance to go through everything in detail, but it's got that Peace of Mind knowing that she's covered. And like I said, we also let you choose that first payment date so you don't pay anything straight away.
[23 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep. Alright, that's fine. Yep.
[24 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, so so that's the two options that you have. What what would you like to do?
[24 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, we'll do that.
[24 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : It's up to you is that you're happy to do that, do it that way. OK, So what day did you want the first payment? So you said, so leave it at 14th of March, is that right?
[24 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : And then Yep, Yep, that'll do.
[24 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[24 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : 14th of March?
[24 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : We do obviously link this up to a preferred method of payment as well, of course. So it can be either a BSP and account number or a Visa master debit card or credit card. But like I said, nothing will come out to the 14th of March.
[24 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep, via Visa card.
