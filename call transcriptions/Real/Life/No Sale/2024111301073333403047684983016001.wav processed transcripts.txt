[6 seconds][Customer] : Good. Thank you.
[7 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. Good to hear. Jeffrey.
[15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 seconds][Agent] : We did receive your expression of interest last night in reference to our life insurance here and we'll follow ended up with yourself there today basically trying you through those options and pricing and see if we can help answer any questions that you've got as well now so that I can do that there. If I may ask, what's prompted you to look into life insurance for yourself of this nature?
[30 seconds][Customer] : Well, I pulled all my super out of my thing and we've gone self super.
[35 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[34 seconds][Customer] : Trump managed Trump and we're doing that. So I just want to go get insurance again.
[42 seconds][Agent] : Oh, so there's no current insurance in place at this stage. OK, fair enough.
[45 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah, just me and my wife, Yeah.
[47 seconds][Agent] : And I guess the reason that you're still needing that type of coverage of you've still got like a mortgage, so dependents at home or things like that or OK, perfect. No worries. And we'll explain to you softer is when we ask that now that soft managed super fund, is that currently set up at the moment? OK, beautiful. So we do have an option here to do it through the soft managed super fund. Uh, for your reference, I'll bring that option up for yourself. Yeah, yeah. Just noting first and foremost, uh, Jeffrey, that all calls are recorded and the advice will be provide is general in nature may not be suitable to your situation. Now, once we bring that up, I've got your name here as Mr. Jeffrey Rogers, Is that right? Thank you, Sir. Date of birth, 17th of October 63. And you're also both a male Australian resident yourself.
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yeah.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. And you might have put this online. Jeffrey, if I could reconfirm, Sir, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Cigarette.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : That's right. Beautiful.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Nah, Nah, I'm not.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : No worries. Thank you.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Since I was 19.
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, mate. Good to help. So I guess you start off with you, Jeffrey, in terms of the level of cover that you need, Sir, based on what you know, what you're required this stage to leave for your wife. Uh, I can let you know that with the soft managed Superfund option, uh, you would be eligible to apply. Let me bring it up for you anywhere from $100,000, uh, all the way up to $500,000. So if I could just reconfirm the, what level of cover you think you would need for your, uh, to leave for the family at this stage?
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm not really sure that's alright. I I, I really want like the pricing sort of thing.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Uh, fair enough.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : What to do and and and how it all goes. I'm just wondering whether are you able to send me a a e-mail? I've got all the details Cos.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Look more than happy to do that, Jeffrey. I guess at the end of the day before we do that, that we're trying to find out what level of coverage you may require so we can give you that price to see if that might be suitable. Umm, if you're a bit insurance to the level of cover, you know, if, if you want to ask yourself that Jeffrey, something did happen to yourself sooner rather than later. If you know, if you're no longer around, umm, how much do you think you would ideally like to leave for your wife there to help her get on by, you know, to pay for whatever you need to. So do you think 100,000 would be enough or do you think you'd need, you know, 300,000 or 200,000 or whatever it may be?
[2 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : To be honest, we have, we haven't even spoke about it.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[3 minutes][Customer] : So it's called, my wife's the one that sent the e-mail to you and we haven't really sat down and spoke about it. We're just talking about it last night because it went and sorted some stuff out as a lawyer and we just, yeah. And then obviously she sent you something and we've not sat down and spoke about it all. I'd say like a quarter, $1,000,000.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yep, yes, certainly. And look, I can bring it up for a $250,000 amount there. The the, the quote request that initially came up, I'm not sure if there was a therefore or the one that your wife did requested Jeffrey was for 300,000. So what I can do is if you go sort of looking around that ballpark, I can start off for the purpose of the quote today at 250,000. Then if you need to make any adjustments, just let us know. We can get up with the ending $50,000 increments anyway.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. OK.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now whilst you bring it up for yourself there, I guess the reason that we ask you guys earlier questions there Jeffrey, is because our cover here, umm, it is designed to provide uh, financial protection for your dependence to a lump sum payment if you were to pass away.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes][Agent] : Now, very simple to apply to check your eligibility with real insurance.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : What we do is we take you through some health and lifestyle questions and then letting you know that if you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for debt due to any calls noting that the only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : And as part of the insurance as well, Jeffrey, uh, we also include for you a terminal ill advance payment. So what that means is that if you were diagnosed with 24 months illness to live by two medical practitioners, then we would actually pay you the amount in full to yourself whilst you're still alive and living.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Sorry. OK.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK Yeah.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Any questions in relation to that so far?
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Now I've got the pricing here now Jeffrey, just be mindful, you may well be aware of this stuff, letting you know that your premium is step, which means it would generally increase each as you age. Umm. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation which means each year you're benefiting that will increase by 3% with associated increases in premium. And of course, you can't opt out of these automatic indexation each year. And what I'll do there, Jeffrey, is give you the pricing not only for now but the following year as well. So it gives you an understanding as to how those premiums do change. And of course, if you need to, you can also find information about our premium instruction on our website as well. OK?
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : But look, if you want to go for that $250,000 as starting point, Jeffrey being one for these prices are indicative all subject to approval, but each fortnights every two weeks for that, that would work out to be $123.65 per fortnight for you. OK. And just states that as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $146.19 per fortnight and then your level of cover would have also increased to $257,500 at that stage as well. Yep.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, Cos I was with Australian Super and I've done them for years and years. And I put and we went, went to look at it and put it out Cos we thought we had a good coverage and I didn't have a very good coverage at all.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Oh my.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : There's something about $9000 coverage and my wife, my wife has got something like 200 and something $1000.
[6 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So your cover was for 9000, was it? Yeah. As a death benefit. Ah, fair enough. Fair enough. Ah, fair enough.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, which is that's why I said, well, it's not worth even having because it would it would $9000 wouldn't pay for a funeral.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : And I guess that's understandable in that case there, Jeffrey. So look, I guess this is all based on that $250,000 amount option there. Would you like to look at a high or even a lower amount? Do you feel that that may be a good starting point for yourself at this stage?
[6 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Well, if you can SE send that through, then I can talk about to my wife and what what all with all the paperwork and all that sort of stuff, whatever we can do and then I can sit down and we can talk about it.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Certainly. And look, we are happy to send you all the information there, Jeffrey, to the e-mail that you left in the file. So we've got that as jjracing05@gmail.com.
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. So please make sure the check to spend further for the first time, but I guess given just before we send it out to your software. So given that this is all subject to approval, we are happy to run you through that process today to see if you are even eligible in the 1st place.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's alright.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And then if you do get approved, we can explain to yourself the what alternate pro processes we have in place and being able to get those documents out to you anyway.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that way we can see if you're even eligible. If you're not, we'll let you know upfront. Then that means you cannot cover for you.
[7 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that that's not a problem.

So what I'm going to do is actually send you that the information for you. It's going to have an option for you guys to finalize online yourself.
[22 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, so when you read through it with your wife, if you guys are happy to proceed with it, all you do is you click the buy now button and then when he asks you for a password to let you know it's going to be your date of birth and then what? It will then prompt you to put in your payment date of your choice and the payment method. Then your wife should have those details with the bank account with the SMSS, and then it'll bring up the terms and conditions for you. And then once you actually accept that, it will actually activate the policy in place. So you'll be covered straight away. OK, so I'm going to send that to your e-mail now. Just be mindful that it may get to your spam folder just for the first time. So please do check your junk and spam folder there. Jeffrey, if there's any questions at all, my name's Francis.
