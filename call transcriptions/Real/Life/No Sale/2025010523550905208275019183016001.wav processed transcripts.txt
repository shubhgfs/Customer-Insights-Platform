[37 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Sowana SOANA sowana like SOANA Sierra S Yes Macanetti so MA KINET India 28th of the 7th 1960 correct?
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Good day. All right, thank you, Marcolina. And I'll grab uh, your umm, father's uh, basic details momentarily as well. Umm, so I know I can just quickly confirm she is a female at an Australian residence, is that right?
[1 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yep, correct.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : No problems. Excellent. OK. And just while I get everything arranged here on my end for you, umm, and I just wanna get a bit of insight into the situation going into this because, I mean, I know you hold umm, insurance with us at the moment. And so what's the reason you decided now's the time to look into funeral color for the inlaws? OK?
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Well, we, we've lived with her for the past three years and I have had the conversation with her because so her son is umm, in another state. So he, we, we basically look after her and me and my children.
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Umm, So I thought it's umm, it's certainly fair that, you know, we're prepared for, umm, that day when it comes.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, of course. And yeah, I understand the hope is obviously that it's a long way away. It's not something we'd have to see happen in the near future. But yeah, I understand the kind of better safe than sorry type of mindset going into this.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's good.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Oh, sure.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : And I'm I'm actually her emergen emergency contact and her pretty much next step in.
[3 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Right. There you go. So yeah, it's quite appropriate that you'd be doing it based on that. I understand that.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Sure. And it's the kids at home with her right now.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Pardon.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Is it or with she said, you said it's just you and your kids at home with your in laws. Yeah, sure.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes, with her, she's a widow.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : All right. OK, sure. Just umm, yeah, just your mother-in-law. I understand that. Got you. OK, Well, no, uh, it makes a lot of sense. Uh, just wanna be prepared for when the time comes and, uh, not gonna lead to how we're able to help with our funeral insurance. We can offer anywhere between $3000 all the way up to $15,000 of color, umm, and be able to look at some different amounts and costs as we go. Make sure that we can find something that's not only gonna, umm, help and support you guys, uh, but if they're at a cost, it's gonna be affordable for you to manage, OK.
[4 minutes][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : And, umm, and with regards to funeral insurance. So I wanna rest assured when the time does come. And, uh, unfortunately, Solana passes away like a leader. It's a simple claim process. You would just call our claims team, they'd send you out a claim form to complete, which is quick and easy to do. You fill it out, send it back to us within the UMM, within the Northeast. Uh oh, sorry, you filled it out the claim form, send it back to us with the relevant proof of death attached.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : That doesn't have to be the death certificate itself. It can be assigned doctor's notes, uh, certifying that she's deceased, like in receiving the hospital, for example. And so in that way, uh, once our claims team receive the relevant documents, the agent generally process and pay the claim in full within the next, uh, business day. OK, just like that.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Alright, alright, Yep.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. That was, I've only got the cost left to bring up in front of me. So while I do that, I'll give you the insight into how the insurance works. OK. If you have any questions, just feel free to ask me as we go on throughout. I'll be happy to answer.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Uh, let me look at the options and costs now I can see actually made an online inquiry for your mother and you're looking around the 15,000 mark. Was that about where you wanted to start?
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Sure. So look at the maximum $15,000 then. But obviously if you have to adjust this at all depending on affordability, just let me know. I'm happy to be a bit flexible here. And so once we do find the appropriate amount of cover at a cost that works for you. So then apply the funeral insurance. Thankfully that is the easiest step of all market leaders. So there aren't any, uh, medical checks you need to get someone to do, nor does she have to do any tests or send anything to us on that front.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : There aren't any physical documents she needs to fill out & either. OK. It is just an entirely over the phone process that I'm able to do.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Just you, umm, so long as you're the one paying for the policy, I'd assume.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yes, correct.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Uh, yeah, no problem. That was how it then works in practice. For the 1st 12 months, we'll cover, umm, Solana for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months, we'll cover it for death due to any cause. Uh, and in addition, there's a terminal illness benefit after she's held the policy for 12 months. This is in the event that Solana is first diagnosed with terminal illness with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner. We can pay the claim in full while she's still living.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep, right.
[6 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, Otherwise, And luckily enough, keep in mind as well that if Solana does unfortunately pass away due to an 100, we will triple the benefit payment. Uh, it's because we don't want, uh, your family being, uh, you guys being burdened by additional costs potentially associated.
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Can you repeat that one?
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah. So, uh, if Solana passes away due to an accident, we will triple her benefit amount when we pay the claim. Uh, because we don't want to see you guys burdened by additional costs potentially associated with an accident, especially if it's like, you know, a car accident or something like that.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Umm, otherwise with regards to the premiums that you'll pay on the insurance, luckily to the premiums are designed to stay the same as Solana gets older. OK, so it's not something that will increase each year as she gets older and you only need to pay the previews all the way up until the age of 85. OK, Now what happened to 85 is we'll cease the previews. There won't be anything more to pay on the policy, but there's still a couple options as to how you can proceed with it. You're welcome to either continue the cover at no extra cost and we'll provide a 25% bonus cover on top of that in case you also have gotten more expensive or anytime after HD5. You can also just choose end the cover then and there and provide 75% of the funeral insurance benefits to you. It's completely up to you though, your choice. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website. OK, mm hmm.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yep, right, yes, right, right.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : So, So up to the age of 85, that second option to cease premium payments, what were you saying about 75%?
[8 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So at the age of 85, regardless of which option you choose, the premiums will cease at age 85.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : But the second option was you can just voluntarily end your cover then and there anytime after age 85. And we pay 75% female insurance benefit directly to you too, OK?
[8 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : What this is that without death?
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that is correct. So, umm, say Solana gets to 85 and you choose this early cash out option. That's what the second option is called.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Umm, then we would pay 75% of her funeral insurance benefits. So if she has $10,000 of funeral cover, for example, that'd be 7 and a half $1000 you'd receive just in there on the early cash option.
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Right. So what's 75% of 15?
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : However yeah, 75% of $15,000. Let me just get my calculator out for you.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, I should have done the math of my calculator.
[9 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : That's alright. Uh 15 / 4 uh is sorry that's completely wrong 15 / 4 that's that. So then times that by three $11,250, it would, that'd be 700. Uh, that's three 75%. So $11,250. Otherwise, though, after the age of 85, if you choose to continue the funeral insurance, we'll cover Solana for her full $15,000 with a 25% bonus cover on top of that. OK, Yeah.
[10 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[10 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So effectively should be covered for 125% of her original now, which would be $18,750. OK.
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : And is that in right? But would that the premiums be indefinite then?
[10 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : The the premiums would still cease age 85. So that cover, the full cover plus 25% bonus cover after age 85 you don't have to pay premiums for.
[10 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. I see what you mean.
[10 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's all that's clarified then.
[10 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : So it's, yeah. So it's a Visa 85 either way.
[10 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Hmm, hmm. Hmm.
[10 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : But if I do decide to keep the cover with you guys and not do an early withdrawal, then it'll be 25% when when that day does come on top of the premium, on top of what was paid. Is that correct?
[11 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So the what she's covered for, so say it's $15,000, we'll still cover her for that full amount and extra 25% bonus cover on top of it.
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Right. OK. I see what you mean.
[11 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yes.
[11 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Perfect.
[11 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Good.
[11 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[11 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no problem. I'm glad I could clarify that. Uh, otherwise, umm, yeah, that is also how it works. And just once again, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website and anything else you need me to clarify before we go through some costs here.
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : No, no, that's it.
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah. So we'll start at $15,000 as per your initial request. But again, Michaelita, if you need me to make an adjustment, I can do so.
[11 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : That's no problem at all, Uh, but for $15,000 funeral insurance, uh, come to be a fortnightly premium, that's every two weeks of $103.02 a fortnight.
[11 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's fine.
[11 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, all good. No problem.
[12 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : In that case, uh, all I need to do then is, uh, I'll firstly grab some of your, umm, basic details here and then, uh, we'll go through, uh, and once I got your details down for your documentation, I'll let you know of a couple of things we'll include in the policy too. Umm, one more point as to how it all works. Then that way, once you've ticked all those boxes, I will be able to do the last steps in regards to getting cover on the way. Umm, first of all though, since we're able to cover your mother for a long time under the funeral insurance, uh, you may pay more in total premiums of the life of the policy than the benefit amounts.
[12 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[12 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : And please also be aware the insurance does not have a savings investment element, so if it gets outside of the 30 days, cover will stop and not receive anything back.
[12 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but as a reminder, once your mother has held the policy for 12 months, we'll cover it for the full $15,000, regardless of the number of premiums you paid up until that point.
[13 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[13 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : And, and as reference to this insurance, we provide what's called the real reward attached to policy. It means following the first policy anniversary dates, we're able to refund you $0.10 off the premiums payment time as a thank you for staying with real insurance for the first year of cover.
[13 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Right. Thank you.
[13 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, good. I I was, uh, so the e-mail address I currently have on file is J count 2819@gmail.com. Is that right? Or Jaycard med2819@gmail.com.

So we'll note down your preferred method of payment. Uh, we'll select the payment date in the future that works best for you. So it doesn't have to be straight away, especially if maybe there's a pay cycle or something you want me to end up with. I'm happy to do that for you.

[15 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : And then I'll read you a declaration and, uh, your mother will be, uh, your mother-in-law will be coming thereafter from today still, uh, and as well, I know I'm not the leader that you have, umm, insurance with us already, which is handy, uh, but I can't, uh, copy over your payment details from that existing policy. I still need to note them down again. Uh, we do a process called encryption, uh, which is security protocol to keep your details secure, but also I just don't have access to them.

[17 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So which payment dates would you like to note down here? Yeah, the 8th of January, did you say? Yeah, no worries. Well, the first time it came out, then on the, uh, January, the 8th and every fortnight on a Wednesday from there. But the cover itself, like I said, still starts from today.

[18 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : I'll read you a declaration now to get that sorted. So these are the terms and conditions of the policy which are way too in full.
