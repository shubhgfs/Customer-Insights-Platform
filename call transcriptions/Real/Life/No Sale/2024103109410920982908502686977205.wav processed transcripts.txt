We'll be happy to provide options available and you can dive in as to what suits and this would be Miss Gina Cochran speaking with correct.
[10 seconds][Customer] : Speaking correct?
[30 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. And your date of birth I have here is the 3rd of January 1983. Correct.
[36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine.
[39 seconds][Agent] : And just keep in mind as well, our calls are recorded and any advice to provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. The last thing I'll just confirm. Yep.
[47 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, I was just going to say I just come home from hospital with my son. So he may call out and leave me.
[52 seconds][Agent] : Oh, yeah, fair enough. Not a problem. We'll get as far as we can. Of course, if you do need to go, just let me know. That's fine. There it is. I hope your son's doing OK.

[1 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah, fair enough, fair enough. Uh, poor little thing. Uh, umm, yeah. Otherwise, uh, just a last to confirm here. Uh, yes, uh, once again, all our calls recorded. Any advice? Providers general in nature may not be suitable to your situation. And I can confirm they're a female and an Australian resident.
[1 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, correct.
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : All right, excellent.
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Thanks very much, Gina, and it's good to speak with you today. Of course, I appreciate you making the life insurance inquiry and following up myself at this point. Uh, but but has ultimately prompted you to look into life insurance with us today.
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : I've been many not for many years, good talent.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : A couple of times I guess I've I've put things into the Internet to sort of get quotes that have never followed through with them. But as I guess my husband and I have been older and we now have a nearly eight our child, it'd be good to get it sorted. If one of us passed away, then obviously got to think about then what would happen. So.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : MMM, MMM, yes, fair enough. No worries. I might just certainly understand. And yeah, appreciate you, umm, of course, taking that first step to finally, umm, follow up with the life insurance and get something organized for yourself.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : And I'm very happy to help out as best I can. Today we'll go through, of course, how it all works, looking those options together.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : And if you don't mind me asking, would there be any debts that your husband and I would need to be sort, would need to sort out if you passed away? Like a mortgage, things of that nature?
[2 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So we have a large mortgage.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep. For our house, that would be the main, probably the only set that we have.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, fair enough. No worries.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : It's only a big one, of course, so yeah, understandable. You wanna make the make sure the mortgage is covered then I gather. Otherwise it's just help out your son's school fees, umm, help your husband figure out what life looks like without you, etcetera.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, exactly.
[3 minutes][Agent] : Yeah, fair enough. No problems. Well, I'm more than happy to help out, of course, once again. And what we do over the phone today is simple. Uh, we'll start by going through how the life insurance works. Now Gina, of course, as, uh, we go along, if you have questions, do feel free to ask. I'm more than happy to help out as best I can, OK?
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : And as well with regards to life insurance, we'll go through then the options once we've gone through how functions and this week anywhere between $100,000 up to $1 million cover, OK, the full range of options available. And from there, we have landed on something that fits your circumstances well, that will cover the mortgage comfortably but also help your husband however need be and be manageable within your circumstances.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Of course, as far as premiums, it'll be easy to apply as I'll take you then through health and lifestyle questions here over the phone to see if you're approved. And Gina, if you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause, The only exception being suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : And there is a terminally ill advanced payment, including now life insurance. So in the event you're diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, it means you're able to pay the claim in full whilst you're still living. OK. Otherwise, uh, do make sure your husband is aware of this because at the time you're passing will be at advanced payment of $10,000 from your life insurance now to help with funeral costs and the other more immediate expenses. Uh, and as well, there is no ex expiration date or age associated. So you're welcome to hold this for short or as long as you deem necessary.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : I, there's not gonna be cut off for you just basically reaching a certain age and as well, uh, junior as well with regards to our life insurance, ultimately what happens is, uh, that your family is going to claim on the policy. Umm, that's, uh, of course, the purpose of the life insurance.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : And with regards to our claims team, I can let you know they are based here in Australia in the same building that I'm speaking to you in today. And they claim to closely working with your loved ones, umm, and the insurer to ensure that the process of accessing your life insurance amount is made simple and easy. Now, uh, on average, we pay claims 10 days faster than the industry benchmark. This is at 70 days versus 80 days.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, easy. Otherwise, uh, one other thing to note as well is as of course, you pay off the mortgage over time or if perhaps the other way, if you took up an initial mortgage on a property, umm, you're welcome to apply to increase or decrease the level of cover to subject eligibility, the time by giving our support team a call. OK, thank you. Otherwise, that's simply how it works.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So we'll get the options there for you, Jenna, to confirm your understanding that before we jump in, did you have any questions or has it all been rather straightforward aid and understand?
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : So we want both.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : My husband and I both want cover.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Easy.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : So is that to do? Are you able to do both or quote for both?
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I can. I can provide options for both of you. That's no issue at all.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Of course, when it comes to the health and lifestyle questions, I have to do that each with you individually.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : That's no issue at all. And we can proceed from there. That's that's fine. Let me bring it up then. I'll start by noting down his details. Then.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : What's your husband's first and last name to you?
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : So Benjamin Coghlan.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Benjamin Coquelin. No worries. And just to double check, your surname's spelled CRGHLAN.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's right.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. What's Benjamin's date of birth?
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : The fifth of the 2nd 81.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, so just a year old and year. And lastly, I can confirm Benjamin, uh, he's a male at an Australian residence. Excellent. Now one thing I will preface, you'll notice a slight difference in pricing between the two of you.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Uh, it is firstly based on just the one year age gap, but also, uh, because uh, males such as myself and Benjamin generally have a shorter life expectancy than females.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Uh, that is also taking into account otherwise, uh, Gina, first I need to ask you, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months, yes or no? And has Benjamin had a cigarette in the last 12 months, yes or no? Excellent. Alright. So, uh, once again, uh, we're able to look anywhere between $100,000 up to $1 million cover and that's for the both of you.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : No, no, OK.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So we can look at some, uh, anywhere between those figures, each, uh, would there be an amount you'd like to look at first, Gina?
[7 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : But probably we'd probably want a different amount because he's obviously the primary income earner.
[8 minutes][Agent] : Yeah, OK.
[8 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : So if I died, he probably wouldn't need so much because he could continue to work. But if he died, then I'd probably need more because I don't earn any near what he earns.
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Fair enough.
[8 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Then yeah, to pay the mortgage.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no worries at all in that case. Yeah, looking at your end first, what amount would you be thinking about for yourself?
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : So if I had to cover our mortgage, our mortgage is about 800,000.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : It's OK, we'll find out.
[8 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : So I don't, I don't know whether we would, whether the premium's going to be sort of out of reach to something that high, whether it's something like, yeah, 500,000 to then only leave me with a smaller mortgage.
[8 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. So, uh, looking at $500,000 and you've been, you passed away and for Benjamin, would that be the same amount or a higher amount?
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, did you say if that was if I passed away or if he passed away?
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Oh, sorry. If you passed away, did you say you would, uh, it would be 500,000.
[9 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : If I passed away, he probably wouldn't need that much. He'd probably like yeah, 3 or 400,000 maybe.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, right. OK. Ah, got you.
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : But if he passed away, then I would need more because he's the he's the pro. He earns more, a lot more money than what I am.
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, fair enough. OK, just making sure I had everything in, uh, in order what you're saying there.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So, all right, let's say for example, then we look at $300,000, uh, if you passed away and, uh, $500,000 if Benjamin passed away. I'll give you the breakdown of what this looks like.
[9 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's OK.
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : If, uh, for Benjamin, $500,000 of life insurance comes to be $35 per fortnight and uh, Gina for yourself, $300,000 a cover would be $15.56 per fortnight.
[9 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK. OK.
[9 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : And so in yes, in title it comes to be $50.56 per fortnight.
[9 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : So we'll be looking at that 50, OK. Yeah, it's up to there.
[9 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : That's sure.
[9 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : If we were to increase bins up to 800, that would cover my mortgage if he was to pass away, what would that change it to?
[10 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Let's have a look. If Benjamin's cover was $800,000, it would be $55.99 a fortnight on his end.
[10 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : And say, for example, if you're stuck with the same 300,000 like before, that would bring the total fortnightly premium then to be $71.55 per fortnight. Is this still sitting calmly for you or are there any adjustments we need to make the other way?
[10 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK, no, that sounds pretty good to me actually.
[10 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, excellent.
[10 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : So I think we'll fix with that.
[10 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, easy. No problems at all. Thanks very much. Umm and in that case from here, the next step of course is I'll take each of you through the health and lifestyle questions will determine your eligibility. Of course I can do yours at this point in time. Benjamin, uh, is he around at this current, uh, at this stage? Yeah yeah, easy.
[10 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : OK, no, he's at work, so you'd have to ring him I guess on his his phone so I can get up on that.
[11 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : I can certainly, yeah, I, yeah, easy. I can certainly take that down, umm, and give him a call at some point.
[11 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Uh, and it doesn't necessarily have to be at the same time that we organize each policy.
[11 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : That's no issue at all.
[11 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[11 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Umm, otherwise or get, of course, your questions are here.
[11 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[11 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so these are health and lifestyle questions to determine your eligibility and just, I want a preference. There's a possibility when we go through the application that we do get you approved, that depending on your, some of your answers, it could be what changes made.
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK. OK.
[11 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So whether it's a change to, uh, the premium or, umm, the, a change to, uh, there's some additional exclusions that could be added. Uh, so we'll find out what that looks like and if we need to make adjustments thereafter, we are welcome to, that's no issue. Otherwise, while that large, Jane, I'll just give you an insight into how your premiums work over time.
[11 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sounds OK. Yep.
[11 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : As the premium, what you pay on the policy, it is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year's your age, But in addition, the policy has automatic indexation. Now this means each year or sum insured, what you're covered for increase by 5% with associate increase in premium and you can opt out this automatic indexation issue if you wish. OK. It's up to you. Now as indication as to what this looks like, let's say for example, you make no change to the policy and you decline indexation, so you just stick with the same sums insured yourself 300,000 and Benjamin $800,000.
[12 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[12 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Next year, the total fortnightly premium be $76.39 a fortnight. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. OK, all right.
[12 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[12 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : And I'll just confirm a couple of details before we jump in, I guess because the questions it's just very always finished lighting. Firstly, Gino, I gather this is the best point of contact for you. This number we're speaking on today.

[19 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Have you ever had an abnormal cervical smear, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, or heart conditions such as but not limited to heart attack and angina or high blood pressure?

[19 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : I had high blood pressure when I had my son, but I had preeclampsia, but that was due for that condition, yes.
[19 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah perfectly fine, no worries. So, uh, with regards to that, umm, I'll have, we would note down the high blood pressure umm, if it wasn't that it wasn't as a result of that, but since that's the case, we don't need to take that into account here.

[20 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[20 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful. Sorry, the next couple of questions now this is still in regards to your medical history. These questions just were differently before. First one asks, other than what you have already told me about in the past three years, have you sought medical advice or treatment by medical practitioner specialists or are you awaiting results? Any medical tests or investigations such as but not limited to any surgeries, X-rays, scans, blood tests or biopsy? Yes or no? Sure. Uh, what condition required the medical examination or advice?
[21 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yes, endometriosis and adenomyosis. Adenomyosis.
[21 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Endometriosis and, uh, adenomyosis. OK, no worries.
[21 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : I'll just look it up.
[21 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, anything. I'm, I'm just searching for both of those. We do have a list of conditions, umm, here that I just looked through. Uh, endometriosis falls on that list. I'm just trying to find the other one. Uh.
[21 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep. So it's a ADENONYOSIS, yeah, similar to endometriosis. I had I had surgery for both of those in May last year.
[22 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yes, denomiosis, right, OK. In that case, so the endometriosis we do have a list, so that's fine. But the just to double check the adenomiosis, this is different to the endometriosis. Sure.
[22 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep. It's very similar, but it is different. It's got stuff, it has a different name, but it involves the uterus. So increasing the size of the uterus rather than the just the endometriosis growing in that region. It's it's sort of inside the wall of the uterus, which makes your uterus larger.
[22 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, right. OK, that makes sense in that case, uh, yes. So that doesn't pop up on our list here. So whilst the endometriosis is on the list, that means you don't have to really delve in any further. That's OK.
[23 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[23 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Uh, the idea meiosis, since that's, uh, more particular condition, uh, it's not no list and it means I'll have to do what's called a referral. So I'll ask you a few further questions just so I can manually input the details and we'll send off the underwriter, Uh, because these types of things they just consider on a case by case basis. OK.
[23 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[23 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So firstly, please describe the reason for the consultation, including symptoms and diagnosis. So of course the diagnosis was adenomyosis.
[23 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[23 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : What symptoms did you have associated with it? Yep. Was it H heavy bleeding just generally or specifically menstrual bleeding?

[29 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. All right, so that all those, all the details I need. So from here, of course, I'll let you know what the referral process looks like once we finish the application. There's just only a few questions I have to go. The next one asks, other than what you've already told me about, are you contemplating seeking medical advice to any symptoms you're currently experiencing within the next two weeks?
[29 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK, no.
[29 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : All right. The next couple questions is regarding your family history. It only concerns your immediate family, this being your mother, father, brother or sister.
[29 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[29 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Gina, uh, firstly, to the best of your knowledge of any of your immediate family living or deceased, ever been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, Huntington's disease or familial and the minor polyposis?

[30 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[30 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : All right, all right. So one last question here, just regarding any hazardous pursuits, do you know, other than one off events, do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fare paying passenger on a recognized airline, motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, AB sailing, scuba diving deeper than 40 meters, cable wreck diving or any other hazardous activity?
[30 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No.
[30 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, so I'll submit your answers there. And umm, yeah, Gene, of course, based on the, umm, disclosure, umm, of the DME access within the application, the application does need to be referred to the underwriter for further assessment. Umm, However, I can tell you to this point, nothing else has come up. There has been no change to premium nor any additional exclusions.
[30 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[31 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So it's really just the underwriting needs to assess the, uh, DME access, umm, and all the details we know there and just make that decision. Uh, for reference, while your application is being assessed, you will be covered for accidental death, which pays out if death was due to a direct result of an accident and cover under this loss until the insurer makes a decision on the application or 30 days from today, whichever is earlier.
[31 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[31 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now, uh, with regards to that, what we do, what we still do is we note down your preferred method payment. We select the payment date that suits you best, of course, in the future.
[31 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yep. OK.
[31 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : That way the underwriter has time to make their assessment and then I read your declaration, uh, to then get the referral sent and the Commission of your cover, it will be sent subject to final assessment by the insurer. Uh, however, if the insurer approves cover without any changes, Gina, uh, it means I'm able to record your acceptance of the policy. Now we send out all your policy information to your e-mail and postal address.
[32 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[32 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Umm, Otherwise, the two other possibilities, umm, with the referral is that it either comes back approved but with changes made or it comes back declined.
[32 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[32 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : If either of those two scenarios are to occur, what I do is I'll give you a call back as soon as possible. I'll get into contact with you. That way I can let you know of the changes or that of the decline and then you can, umm, inform me of how you'd like to proceed with those changes in mind. Or if it's decline, obviously we're not able to proceed. Umm, but yeah, otherwise that's how it all looks. So we'll get this sorted from here. And of course, I will open up his Benjamin's profile and I'll arrange time to speak with him.
[32 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[32 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Uh, but yes, Gina, uh, we'll get to the last steps for you. Of course. Uh, firstly, we'll start with the preferred method of payment. Is it through our BSB and account number or via card?
[33 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : I can do either. Is it? Does it make any difference to the premium or not?
[33 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, there's there's no difference, Uh, no surcharges associated with either. So it's really just up to personal preference. Whatever's successful. Yeah, sure. Uh, would it be under your name, Gina Coughlin? Sure. All right. And is that a savings or a cheque account that you hold?
[33 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, BSc in account, Yes, Let's have a look.
[33 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[33 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : I think it's a a yes account, right. So I'll have to be in your account and I'll do it.
[33 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : It's OK, Take your time.
[33 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's cool. Let's just go with savings account.
[33 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. No worries.
[33 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : I'm pretty sure it is.
[33 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, anything. No problems. Uh, all right. And uh yeah. When you're ready, I'll start with the BSB number, please. Sure.
[34 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, sorry, I just wanted to check before we go ahead with this part because this this doesn't lock me in for anything I do when I have to run it past my husband.
[34 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfectly fine.
[34 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Good.
[34 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, what we do, of course, is we just organise the details. We set a payment date.
[34 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[34 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Now, obviously if the underwriter comes back with your application with changes made or if it's declined, then yeah, it wouldn't be locked in. We'd of course get into contact with you so we can confirm those changes before you re.
[34 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[34 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, so we can get your confirmation. If it does come back approved though, I'll be able to keep click it through on my end and get the coverage underway. But you still have between now and the first payment dates to have the discussion with your husband, OK?
[34 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[34 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Umm, yeah, correct.
[34 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : So I can call up and say I don't want to proceed if if the plan is not to.
[34 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : If that's the case, is that completely comfortable for you? Hmm.
[34 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yeah, I just when I put the enquiry through on the weekends, I, I did you guys and I also did Mobiloak. So I haven't quoted to Mobiloak yet and I'd like to get a, another quote as well.
[35 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fun. Yeah, easy. That's no issue. Sorry.
[35 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[35 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : I'll just make sure you're fully informed of the two options of how we can proceed because we asked able to of course send it just out to you in the form of quotation. Now it would mean even if this does get approved and no changes that I need to get into contact with you again to get the confirmation and etcetera. Ah and that's certainly valid. If you'd like to do that. No issue.
[35 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep, OK.
[35 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Umm, however, yes. Otherwise from here we do just organize, umm, the preferred method of payment. We select the payment date that suits you best in the future. And so we'll have the underwriter come back with their decision and if it's a fully approved, I'll be able to click it through on my end. But if there are any changes, umm, or if you do decide to cancel and switch over, that's fine too. Give us a call out before that first payment dates. We'll get it enlarged also for you. OK. Over the phone, yeah.
[36 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK, that's fine. So I'm happy to do that and lock the bank down details and stuff in and then I'll ring up. If I decide then I'm gonna go with the other quote.
[36 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Anyway, Yeah, no worries. Appreciate that, Gina. No worries. Uh, so yes, when you're ready, we'll start with the BSB number, please.
[36 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's 923100.
[36 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. That's with, uh, ING. Alright. And your account number when you're ready. Yep.
[36 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, 312094010.
[36 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. Alright. And Gina, when would you like the first payment to come out for the life insurance?
[36 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : How long does the underwriter usually take to assess?
[36 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, great question. So in my personal experience, it does take generally one to two business days. However, Full disclosure, it can take anywhere up to 30 days.
[36 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. Why don't we go with the 1st of May? So that's the start of the month and then if it's not back by then, obviously it's not gonna come out on the 1st of May.
[37 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Of May, did you say?
[37 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Oh, sorry, I'm looking. I'm still in the wrong. I'm back in my calendar looking at the from the dates from last year from the surgery.

[37 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, either either or. It's fine. Let's have a look here. And for reference, do you, uh, mention the 1st of February? Would you prefer it be a monthly payment or is fortnightly preferable?
[37 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Probably fortnightly then.
[37 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : That's fine, yeah.
[37 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : So maybe we'll start it earlier if we go, let's go Tuesday the 17th, which is next Tuesday.

[38 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[38 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : And yeah, there is a very good chance it will come back within the next one to two business days, but we just state that it can take up to 30 days in case, umm, but yeah, uh, now next Tuesday, that's the 16th of January. Did you mean next Wednesday, the 17th or did you mean the Tuesday?
