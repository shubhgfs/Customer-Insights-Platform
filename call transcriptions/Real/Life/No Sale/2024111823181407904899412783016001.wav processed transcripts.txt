[3 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So just yeah, being a year younger does open up a little bit bigger of a range there for her.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : So you're saying she'd be covered for that? So if something happened to her, I'd get that 750?
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : But what level of cover for each of you would you be wanting to look at if not?

[6 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's correct.
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. All right, yeah, I do want to point out you probably do remember having been through a previously, alright, but life insurance, it is a stepped premium, alright, which means that it will generally increase each year's wage. In addition, the policy has automatic indexation, OK, which means that each year the benefit amount will increase by 5% with an associated increase in the premium.
[6 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Now if you don't want that, you can just choose each year to opt out of the automatic indexation and keep the benefit amount the same. Alright, but what it looks like is that next year, as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, the your monthly payment would be two 4915 cents with the benefit amount going up to 425,000 for sorry $420,000.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : But like I said, if you don't want that, you're happy to just keep it the same next year. Let me send you the policy renewal.
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : You just opt out of that automatic indexation and you can keep the benefit amount the same.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Alright, that's good. Yeah.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : And you know, similarly, as time goes by, you know, mortgages paid off, debts are paid off, kids are out of the house, like whatever, you don't need to have as much there.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : You could start to reduce your policy as well, which will reduce the payments that you're making, but still leaves something behind as well.
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. No, that's fair enough.

[16 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[16 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no.
[16 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So not, yeah, not that specific one, right?
[16 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. Yeah.
[16 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine.
[16 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[16 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So the next one is, to the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family members suffered from cancer, heart condition, stroke or other hereditary disease prior to the age of 60 and so up to hazardous pursuits. So other than a one off event, for example, gift certificates and vouchers, do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fair paying passenger on a recognized airline, Motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, AB sailing, scuba riding deeper than 40 meters, cave or wreck diving or any other hazardous activity?
[17 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : No, yeah.
[17 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so that is all the questions that we do need to ask of you, alright? So outcome of the application alright.
[17 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[17 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So if you have been approved, alright, there has been an adjustment on the price, it has gone up a bit. It is because of your BMI, OK, So it's gone up a bit like you said, you're working on it and you are bringing that number down. OK.
[17 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
[18 minutes][Agent] : So I do want to stress that you know, the loading's been included for now, but obviously you change that number once you know you can, you can give us a call and apply for that loading to be reviewed to get reduced and even removed.
[18 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Alright. Oh yeah, that's fair enough. Yeah, yeah.
[18 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so no, the price has gone up for now, but it doesn't have to stay up, OK, So you know like you say, you keep working on it, you bring that number down, OK, you can give us a call and you can apply for that loading reviewed and get it reduced and even removed depending on the numbers at the time.
[18 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yep. If you drop it down to what, 300? Yeah. So what's that the difference? Sorry then, buddy. How much does that make?
[18 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Alright, what it looks like though, so if we keep you covered at the 400,000, the monthly payment is coming in at 35952 if we start it off, if we drop it down to 300,000, you'd be looking at 26964 a month 300,000 so so it'd be 200 and 6964 a month. If we start off at 300,000 and then like I say later down the track, you know keep working on the weight loss there. You can apply for that loading to get removed to reduce the premium. You can apply to have the cover increased later as well. Subject to relatives. Yep.
[19 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, OK, we'll do that, eh, Yep, Cos that's M more motivation then.

[19 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, pay money.
[19 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, we'll do that.
