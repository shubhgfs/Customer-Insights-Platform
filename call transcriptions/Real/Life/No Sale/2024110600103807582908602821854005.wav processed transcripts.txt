[10 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Uh, Sir, I need to ask firstly, what was the dates of your last episode?

[11 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[11 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. All right. So after six months. Medication was no longer necessary as condition had cleared and then for dates you last received any treatments. Would that be for example like late 2009 or early 2010? Sure. So would it be like early to mid 2010? Sure, no problems. Hi, those are all the questions we'd need to ask.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Probably in 2010 at the end, Yeah, yes, yeah, yeah.

Or are you awaiting results for any medical tests or investigations such as but not limited any surgeries, X-rays, scans, blood tests or biopsy?

[16 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Sure. Yep.
[16 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Umm, OK. So I mean, in reference to the, uh, mental health circumstances, we'll need to refer the application to the underwriter for further assessment.
[16 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep. Yep.
[16 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Outside of that, uh, all that's come up is just that, umm, exclusion I mentioned before about the back order back disorder requiring treatment. OK.

[17 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[17 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : We select the payment date that suits best.
[17 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[17 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Umm can be a date in the future that firstly worse than a pay cycle for you.
[17 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[17 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : But of course we need to make sure the underwriter has time to make their assessment A and as well we are. I'll read you a declaration, umm, and then I'll have the referral sent off thereafter.
[17 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[17 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Now, As for reference, it's mentioned you cover. Of course, it's subject to final assessment by the insurer.
[18 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Mm Hmm.
[17 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So meaning if the insurer approves cover without any changes, uh, through this, I'm able to record your acceptance of the policy now and we send out all your policy information to e-mail and postal address, which in short means, uh, in the underwriter comes back with the decision. If it's approved with no changes, I'm just able to click it through on my end.
[18 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[18 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : You'll be sent the confirmation by, by e-mail as well as the policy documents by e-mail and via post, Uh, and you'll be covered thereafter under the policy itself.

Umm, if it's one of those two, I'll of course get into contact with the ASAP.
[18 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. No worries.
[18 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : That way we can confirm the changes before proceeding once more.

[18 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : I will. Yep.
[18 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : They mentioned you were going to umm, cancel the life insurance, umm, for this one. Did you still want to do that today or did you want to wait until the confirmation of this one comes through 1st?
[19 minutes][Customer] : Oh, no, I'm happy to do it today. Thanks.
[19 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problems at all. Otherwise, I mean, purely speculating, I feel like the worst case scenario with this would just be a mental health exclusion. It wouldn't decline. That wasn't, I don't see any reason why outrights decline the application.
[19 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sure.
[19 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : But yeah, I mean, hopefully it comes back approving, no changes. We'll see how it goes though.
[19 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep, no worries.

So as a security measure, umm, I'm basically not able to access those details and just copy them over.
[19 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Bye.

[21 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, uh, because the premiums all turn out the same fortnightly, monthly or annually, so I can just change the frequency to help line up with your pay cycle if you prefer.
[21 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I would. Thank you.
[21 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : No worries. In that case. Uh, for reference, what the monthly figure looks like is $59.65 per month. OK uh, otherwise, umm, you said it was the 15th or 16th of every month. Would the 16th be a safer number?
