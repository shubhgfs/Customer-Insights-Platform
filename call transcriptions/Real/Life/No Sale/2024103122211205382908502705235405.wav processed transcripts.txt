[2 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : That's right.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So I'll take you through how the cover works and the main features and benefits. If you do have any questions along the way, feel free to stop me and ask away. Umm, our cover is pretty straightforward in the way that we offer it. It is designed to really provide financial protection for your loved ones for a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. So it's fair to give you Peace of Mind that if something happens to you, then your family has that financial security. Now at the easiest, very easy to apply. We just ask you some health and lifestyle questions over the phone to see if you are approved. If you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we'll pay your claim in full. So the money could be used for, say, medical costs to ensure that you receive the best care possible. And we also include a $10,000 advance payment to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. Generally paid out within 24 to 48 hours. Now, any questions for me so far? Too easy. I'll bring up a quote for you here. Now. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Nope.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : And we can have a look at cover for you anywhere from 100,000 going up in $50,000 increments to a maximum of let me see. So it'll be a maximum of half a million.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Is 1/2 moon is Yes.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So what benefit amount would you like for me to quote you up is a half million, Half a million, sure. So that comes to a fortnightly premium of $165.48, which equates to only $11.82 per day for half $1,000,000 cover. How does that sound?
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Is that what Penny's on? Is it?
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : I can't give you any information about that just because I didn't ask for permission to, but I'm more than happy for you to take a second to talk to your wife if you'd like.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : It'll be 300, 3350. I think you're so I think she's, that's what she had.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : You want to look at 300-3350. OK, so 350,000 is a fortnightly premium of $115.84. You're happy with that?
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, that's fine. Thank you.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Now your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year is your age. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will increase by 5% for you, with associated increases in premium designed to try to keep up with the advertising cost of living for you and your family. You do get made on a month prior to these changes each year, and you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year depending on what you prefer at the time. But as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be, it will be once it comes up. And you can also find information about our premium shop shop on our website if you're interested. So it would then be $138.76 per fortnight and your benefit amount will then be $367,500.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yeah, start discount after the year.
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, now I'll take you through a more check. Yeah. You can opt out of the automatic indexation each year depending on what you'd prefer at that time. You'll get made on a month prior to these changes each year.

Andrew Smith receives $350,000 in the event of life insurance if benefit is not paid in the event of suicide in the 1st 13 months of the policy. Your premium for your first year of cover is $115.84 per fortnight. Your premium is a step to premium, which means it will be calculated at each policy anniversary and will generally increase as you age. Your sum insured will also increase automatically by 5% each year and you can opt out of this each year. Included in your premium is an amount payable to GFS of up to 65% to cover costs. Your premium will be debited from your credit card which you are authorized to debit from and have provided to us. The policy documentation, PDF and FSG will be sent to you within 5 working days and if you have provided us with an e-mail address, your policy documentation will also be emailed to you today. You should carefully consider these documents to ensure the product meets your needs. You have a 30 day cooling off. In which you may cancel your policy and any premium you may have paid will be refunded in full unless you have lodged a claim. If you are replacing an existing policy with this cover, we recommend that you do not cancel that policy until you have received and reviewed our policy in full. There are risks associated with replacing policies, as your new policy may not be identical to your existing cover, and there may be other risks you should consider depending on your circumstances. We have the complaints process, but you can access at any time by contacting us. Full details are available online and in the documentation we are sending you. Do you understand and agree with the declaration I've just read to you? And would you like any other information about the insurance now or would you like me to read any part of the PDFs to you? Thanks. And just confirming, uh, is this your contact number? O4 O 613-9420? Not all right. Are you wanting to still keep this number on your file?
