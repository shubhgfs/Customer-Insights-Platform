[49 seconds][Customer] : So it's, it's yeah. It's just security for my family, really.
[50 seconds][Agent] : Oh, beautiful, Of course, yes, it's obviously looking, you know, to alleviate the financial burden that might be left behind when you do pass. Now is it there, you know, just to provide for the family or, you know, cover for any sort of bills or expenses or just a bit of both?

[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, certainly no problems at all. So what I'm here to do for you this morning, most importantly is, is explain to you to cover. That way you have an understanding of what it is going to look like for your loved ones when they do, you know, calls up and make that claim. Now there are some things that you can claim on with the cover as well.
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[1 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So with us here, with our life insurance there, what it is designed to do is provide the financial protection for your loved ones through that lump sum payment if you were to pass away.
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Now, when they do call us up to, you know, make that claim, we're not going to tell them what to do with the money. So if it's a time, there might be a mortgage or a loan or even for your family just to set themselves up there for the future. At the end of the day, it's fair to give you the Peace of Mind that if something was to happen that there is going to be some financial security available for your loved ones.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Mm, Hmm.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Now we have uh, simplified the process in ordering to take out a life insurance with us. There is no going to any sort of doctors, no blood checks, no medicals with the doctor.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Alright.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : What we have done here is we have simplified that process down to just some yes or no health and lifestyle questions over the phone to see if you are approved and if you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK. Oh, OK. Gee, that's yeah. Go on. Yeah.
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Now, uh, now look in addition to what this cover is providing for your family there, I did mention as well there are some benefits that you can claim on.

[2 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm, mm hmm, OK Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : And what that one means is if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay your claim in full to you whilst you are living.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm. Alright.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So that could give you the ability there, you know, to cover off the any sort of bills, get the money, you know, set the family up for the future. It's safe for you to use if you do need to obviously claim on that part of the cover. Now let's jump into some pricing for yourself there. So just to begin with, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : OK, No, no, no smacker.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful all right now based on your age, we can offer you anywhere between $100,000 all the way up to the maximum there of 750,000. So what level of cover were you thinking for yourself there?

[7 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Uh, because obviously with those questions there, they do obviously determine the final outcome and pricing of the cover.

[8 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah, that sounds good.
[8 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. Well, let's do that one now. Just a little bit more about the cover from your end because there are some uh, features and benefits that we are gonna provide to you there. Umm, so that first one is what we call the real reward. So what that one means is following your first policy anniversary dates, we will actually refund you 10% of the premiums that you have paid to us in that time.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : And as well, we are gonna send you out a free Australian legalized. We'll keep there with the cover. So you will get a freewheel kit as well.
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's great.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Now if it, and obviously if you do 2 separate policies, you both are gonna get an individual real reward and you both get a obviously free will kit each as well.
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So that's obviously the differences between the two covers.
[8 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : And is that W do we fill it out if it's free? But then what do we pay for when we do the will?
[8 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and just umm. So obviously we just provide the will. There are instructions on obviously how to make that legal.
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but it's not, it's, it's not something from our end that we do here.
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. OK.

[9 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : That's great. Thank you.
[9 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yep, umm. Now just a bit about your premiums there. Your premium is step, which means it will generally increase each year is your age. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation which means HE your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. You can opt out of this automatic indexation HE but look as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $69.10 per for night. However, your benefit amount has increased to $472,500 off the protection. So I can I can help.
[9 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : So I can, I can opt to leave it where it is and opt out of that and it stays the same.
[9 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So yes, so HEHE, you obviously do have the options that some use, you know you want that indexation or some use you don't want the indexation.
[9 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. OK, OK, that's good.
[9 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : You just have to give us a ring when you get that renewal documents and we can obviously put, you know, label it at the whatever benefit amount is that you do tell us to umm.
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : That makes sense.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Now you can also find information about a premium structure on our website. So let's just take you through these questions here to check for your eligibility for the cover. Now, if you are accepted, what we're gonna do is post and also e-mail out all of the documentation to you there. Now we do have an address because I can see you have looked back into this one in 2022. Are you still residing at Unit 1/7 Riddle Rd.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : No, no, my address has changed. I just just to ask you if I wanted to go down in the premium just so I wanted to make it 300,000.

[10 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK, because we'll have to sit down and do the budget, that's all.
[10 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : And also, yeah. And obviously that works for the same with increasing as well. So it's just subject to eligibility at time. It gives you, you know, some people, you know, as their mortgage drops, they might not need a full amount of cover.
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yes, Yeah. OK.
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So they obviously bring the premium down obviously with that one, or they might increase it. It's completely flexible. Umm.
