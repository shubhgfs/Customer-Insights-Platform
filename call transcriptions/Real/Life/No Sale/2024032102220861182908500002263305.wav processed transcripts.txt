[2 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : But at the end of the day, as mentioned, once we go through these medical questions with you, if you are accepted and once you decide to actually commence the policy, then you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause at all.

[3 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Now have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Well done. Well, uh, we can offer you a minimum of $100,000 to cover up to a maximum of 300,000.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : No yeah. Log.

[3 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I clicked on 300, but 200,000 is enough.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Let's have a look inside of there. I cannot change it anyways, so I can do as many quits as likely find something comfortable for you. OK.

[4 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that, that'll, that'll do, Yeah.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : For sure No worries. Well, let's find out if you are eligible for this umm, Now one final thing I do need to make sure you understand is that with this insurance, your premium is stepped, which means you'll generally increase it as your age. But in addition, the policy does have automatic indexation, which means that each year your uh sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increase in premium. But this is optional. It's up to you if you want to accept it or not. You can just simply, uh, you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year if you wish. Umm, I do need to give you an idea of what it would be next year if you did choose to accept that in that indexation, just so you can see the difference yourself.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : We have a a tool which calculates for us it DOE. It does state here that our premium projections are indicative only Dominic can assume you don't make any changes to your cover. So as an indication, if you make no changes to your policy or premium mix, you'll be $137.19 a fortnight if you chose to accept that indexation, which means your 200,000 next year will grow to $210,000.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : And once again, that's up to you to decide. You can also find information about a premium section on our website if you want to double check that yourself.

[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Just checking in with you to make sure that was all clear. You understand how that works?
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no problem. That's fine.
