[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Yep. No, definitely. OK. And the podiatrist at all or or don't use that service either. Perfect. OK, so, so you're not using your extras all too often there.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : So no, no, don't use that, no.
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, great. All right. Well, sounds like we've got, uh, all that information and we can find the cover based on those needs. Uh, we just enter a few of these details and we can get this up and running. Uh, so you're living in Queensland, is that right?
[9 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[9 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : I just want quote. I just wanna.
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, No, no, definitely, definitely. That's OK. Uh, now, uh, can I confirm that you have full Medicare eligibility? Perfect. OK. Now you may be eligible for the Australian Government rebate.
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
[9 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : It is income tested.
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : You can hear me.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Sorry. Yeah, perfect. So you mentioned you're on the pension, so is that under $93,000 a year?
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : I think I am, yeah.
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, great. I'll put that in there. Alright. And now with HCF, do you pay monthly or fortnightly? How would you like me to present the quote there? Monthly.
[9 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : I pay monthly, they direct debit.
[9 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Perfect. OK. Do you do you use for medial massage at all?
[9 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no.
[9 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. I'll let you know. So the level of cover we're looking at is a silver plus for the hospital. So that's gonna give you cover for those things that we're talking about South joint replacements, rehabilitation in hospital, your heart and vascular system. Uh, and there is other things in there as well, but they'll, the main couple that you were, you were looking towards. Uh, now this is with the real starter extras. OK, So the starter extras gives you annual limits for optical, general and major dental, physiotherapy, chiropractor, uh, osteopathy. And also you get some remedial massage limits in there as well. OK.
[10 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : So if you want to go get a massage, you can use that too. Uh, now were you looking for the $500 excess or the 750 excess?
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Well, I'm on 250 where I am now, but I was, I had vital extras with them.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, right.
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : I was was premium but we put it down to vital so.
[10 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And the, the main reason why I'm looking at the starter extras here for you today is because you you're not using your extras all too often there. So it still gives you those annual limits if you do want to go get some claims at the dentist or, or claim back on the Sunnys every every year or so, you can do that. But it's not going to give you, it's not going to put a, a all those range of services on there that you're not planning on and and they're just going to waste there. OK, Yeah.
[11 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK.
[11 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK. So did you want to look with the $500 excess for the hospital?
[11 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Well, yes, I wouldn't go by one Cos the one that you've just at the moment so.
[11 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yep, yeah, of course. No worries. OK. So I'll let you know. So the monthly premium for this one is just $198.58.
[11 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[11 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So how does that com? Sorry.
[11 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Does that include, is that including hospital?
[11 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So that's the hospital and extras?
[11 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : So does that cover private hospital or just public?
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. No private hospital, of course. Yeah. Did you have any private hospitals in mind? I can look them up, make sure we're contracted with them.
[12 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Oh, well, not really. I mean, it's funny. Every time I've had an operation, I've gone to public.
[12 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Right, Right. OK, well, well, what suburb do you live in? I can't let you know the private hospitals around your area or in your suburb? Yep, Yep.
[12 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, Logan Village, we live, but the private hospital would probably that's QLD would be Greenslopes or I don't know where Saint Andrews is.
[12 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : That's OK.

[14 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : It's 48.
[14 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Oh wow.
[14 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : I think only $50 is it?
[15 minutes][Agent] : OK, so we can save you a fair bit of money there, $5050 a month. That's good to hear.
[15 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I know. It's quite a lot of money.

[19 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : So for me, that's once a year, right? Right. I had a colonoscopy this year.

[20 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : I had a colonoscopy earlier this year. Yeah, but he is having one in January, so he'd have. How would that go with him?
[20 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, right with him. So it's it's once per person per calendar year. So he would he would have to pay that on his pH.

[20 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. It's only as the day. That's it, you know the day clinics they have.

[20 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, So still gotta pay it, We understand that.
[20 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[20 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : But then he'd be covered all year anyway, wouldn't he? So.

[21 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yes. OK.
[21 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So how's all this sounding there for you? Is there any other questions that I could help clear up for you?
[21 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Nope, not really I think. OK, so it's 198.
[21 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 19858 a month for for yourself.
[21 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK. And do you go up in right?

[21 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So our premium increase, Yeah.
[21 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : 1st of April, same as HCS.
[21 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So our premium increase is the due to be set I, I believe the 1st of April, right. OK. Yeah, Yeah. So is this something we'd we'd like to go ahead with today?
[21 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, why not?
[21 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Well to go ahead we'll just go through the cover in a little bit more detail and then we can get this set up there for you. So with the hospital cover, you're covered for all Medicare recognised services except for the following. OK, so assisted reproductive services, cosmetic surgery, dialysis for chronic kidney failure, pregnancy and birth weight loss surgery and services not covered by Medicare.
[22 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[22 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, the minimum benefits payable. So Mbps hospital psychiatric services, this service is partially covered in hospital and there will be significant out of pocket costs if you want to claim on them.
[22 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[22 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Now the standard hospital waiting periods are 12 months of pre-existing conditions, two months of non pre-existing conditions, two months of psychiatric care, rehabilitation or palliative care, even for a pre-existing condition. Now you're living in Queensland. Perfect. So you have an accidental injury benefit, which means if you are injured as a result of an accident and you present to AGP or hospital within 72 hours of the accident, we will cover you for treatment relating to the accident. If you're admitted to hospital as an inpatient within 90 days of the accident, this service has a one day waiting period. Now we went over that excess, so that's payable ones per person per calendar year. Now for your extras, uh, I'll rate out the standard extras waiting periods.
