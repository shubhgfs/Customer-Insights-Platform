[8 seconds][Customer] : Hi, it's Helen.
[11 seconds][Agent] : Hi, Helen, it's Anthony from Real Insurance following up with you again. How are you?
[15 seconds][Customer] : I'm fine, thank you. How are you going, Anthony?
[14 seconds][Agent] : I'm fine, thank you. How are you? Good, good. I've got a good thank you. The reason for our call is that we've seen that you've been on the website looking at some life insurance for yourself. I just want to give you a hand with that today and show you some quotes.
[25 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that would be good. Yeah, thank you.
[27 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, it is a new call though, so typically I'll need you to confirm your first name, last name and date of, uh, birth again, please.
[34 seconds][Customer] : OK, it's Helen, Mark and 26865.
[34 seconds][Agent] : OK, it's Helen, Mark and 26865. Perfect. Then of course, you are a female Australian resident. Yes or no, Correct.
[44 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[45 seconds][Agent] : Yes. I'm sorry, I can do yes or no for that one specifically. OK, thank you. Very good, excellent. Uh, you take it on the boxes there and please on all calls are recorded and any advice we provide is general in nature. It may not be suitable to your situation to begin with the Helen. I mean, what's done it for you? What's made you think now is the right time? So it's looking for life insurance for yourself anyway.
[44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, sorry, Yes, we've recently changed mortgage providers.
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Uh, we recently changed mortgage provider so our policy was canceled.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : So our policy was cancelled when we changed.
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I'm sorry. OK.
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : So no, that's OK.
[1 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, right.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Just need to we just need to get some more life insurance for myself and my partner.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So we just need to get some more life insurance for themselves and that certainly so essentially filling the gap there and, and really that that's what the policy is designed to do anyway. It is there, as you know, to provide a financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment, how much you can afford to do anyway if you were to pass away. And then they, as your beneficiaries can go ahead and use that money for whatever they need to at that point, you know, whether that's to help them pay off a mortgage or a loan or help them maintain their lifestyle, whatever it is they can use it for. Now, you mentioned a part of there, there is actually no price difference between looking at two single covers versus a joint cover anyway. So say for example, you find a policy you're happy with, you get approved, we organize and send it out to you. Helen, if he reads it and he's happy with what he sees. And when he has the time, he just gives us a call in and we take him through the, uh, same process and we'll get his own life insurance. You guys can still nominate each other as your main beneficiaries anyway. Yeah, but for yourself, just start with, we'll just, umm, do a simple smoking status question and then we'll bring up the levels and then you'll guide me as to how much you need. This is what you can afford to do and we'll help you how how? Find a happy balance there. But, umm, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes. Soon then no excellent. And by the way, uh uh, because that makes quite a difference in how much you pay as well. So we're happy to put you down as a non-smoker, but with the levels of cover, OK, you can still choose anywhere from $100,000 to cover up to $500,000 based on your age. Where would you like me to start with this quote for you?
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK, no, I'd probably look at 500,000.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Uh, I'd probably look at UH-500 cents. So from the top, if it is a bit too steep, you let me know.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : We can drop it down, whatever you need to do. But before we look at the cost, I want to explain to you how the policy works. Because one thing we don't want to do here is, you know, over insure everything you don't need. So I'll keep it simple with the standard cover 1st and you let me know how how that sounds and then we'll go back to those numbers. OK alrighty. So very easy to apply for. It's just a set of health and lifestyle questions over the phone today. I have and take 5 minutes and that will determine that result and that's it. If you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause. So immediate Peace of Mind. There's no waiting periods. You know, once it's done you have to think about it again. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months Helen. But umm, that's it. Once you're in the policy, you are covered 24/7 worldwide for the rest of your life as long as you're making the payments will cover you.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK, that sounds good.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Also, though, you get a terminally ill advanced payment in case because if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less delayed by a medical practitioner, we definitely still want to be able to help. And how we do that at that point is we'll pay out your claim in full to you, the 500 grand, while you're still alive. So you can use that money for whatever you need to before you actually pass away, you know, cover medical costs, tie up loose ends, whatever you need to do with that money, you can. It's yours. And then last and not least others funeral expenses. We don't want that to be burdened to anyone. So we also include a $10,000 advance payment to help with the funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time as well.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK, that sounds good.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So that is all included in your policy already. I just wanted to check in so far, Helen, did that all make sense that cover all the bases there?
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's fine. Yeah.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yes, that's fine. Yes, OK, let's start with 500,000 for that level of cover with everything included there. It's mentioned we could do that one for 100 and, uh $37.28 a fortnight, which works out to be roughly $68.64 per week. OK.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Now are the levels below that as well? Even if it's out of curiosity, what do you think at that level? Do we need to look at something a bit lower or is that, uh, no, that would kind of fit in with what uh, uh, finances and, and would that be if I had the Leo on as well?
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : No, that would kind of fit in with what our finances and and would that be if I had Leo on as well, would she be covered at the same rate or would that be double the rate?
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Would she be covered at the same rate or would that be civil bill for, for me? I'll, I'll give you the exact number so far anyway. Umm, give me two seconds. My system's just being a bit slow here. I'm so sorry.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's alright.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Umm, OK, we are good now. OK, so I'll get her details from you starting with her date of birth please uh 17865 yes. And was it Leah? Leah, It's LEONI.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : 17865, it's LEONI.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Oh, sorry, Leoni.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Leoni.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Umm, yeah, my apologies. Umm, so.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, she just prefers Leo.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, got it.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Umm, So LEONI. And what was Leo's? Uh, that was her first name, obviously.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And what was her last name? Andrews.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Andrews.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yep. With an S. Perfect. OK. And she's, of course, a female Australian resident. Yes or no?
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Correct. Yes, yes, Sorry.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Correct. OK, no, I appreciate that. Thank you so much. Umm, And she's your partner? Yes. OK, beautiful. Now, has she had a cigarette in the last 12 months? No.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes, No.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Very good. OK, well, so, uh, oh, so she's the same age as you. Yeah. OK, beautiful.
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, 9 days apart. Yeah.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : There you go. There you go. Beautiful. So realistically, we might be looking at a very similar, uh, similar premium then. So, OK, for her same deal, she can choose from $100,000 up to $500,000 of cover basement rate. You'd like me to look at the same level or, umm, maybe, maybe less.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Maybe, maybe less for her.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, That's OK for her. Yeah. What do you think? Umm, 403 fifty, probably 350. OK. Yeah. OK, let's see that. OK. It would be $96.09 a Fort back and 9:00 cents and nine cents.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, and probably 350, $6, sorry, $96 and and nine cents a fortnight. OK, good. Oh, that's it.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Now whichever level you guys choose by the way, umm, it is flexible down the track. I mean depending on your age and subject to eligibility, you can give us a call and apply to increase or decrease your benefit amount. Anyway, umm, seeing where Leo Leo's at, did you? Would you be curious to see what yours would look like at that level or something? I'm happy to I'm the main way. Ah OK. Yes I would rather keep my higher. It would impact her more if I pass away.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : No I'm I'm happy to hear I'm the main wage earner so I would rather keep mine higher because obviously it would impact her more if I pass away so so I'd rather keep mine higher.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Definitely, definitely. I'd rather keep mine higher. Beautiful. And as, as far as, uh, you know, the process as well, it's, it's quite simple really. I mean, next we go through the health and lifestyle questions to see if we can approve you. If you do get approved, Helen and the underwriters are happy to take you on board. What then that allows us to do is go ahead and organize to send out the policy to you in full. Difference is, is we do provide you with protection today over the phone. So you have that Peace of Mind even while you're looking over it. But ultimately it is up to you whether or not you do the side to actually stay with us because if after reading it you change your mind for, uh, whatever reason, decide against it, that's totally fine as well. And we're simply a phone call away if the decision goes the other way anyway. Yeah.
[8 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's fine.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Do you need the, umm, question? Oh, please, yes.
[8 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : So the only other question I had is to what? What age do you provide cover up to?
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So what, what age do you provide cover up to? Yeah, great question. So with this one, as long as you're making the payments held and we'll cover you, there's no expiry age on the cover. Uh, right.
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Ah, right.
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : That's good, because a lot of them say 65.
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : That's good because a lot of them say at 65 they stop.
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, so so long as we continue to pay the policy, then we're still covered up until we pass away.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : As long as we continue to pay the policy, then we're still covered up until the the day you pass away. Yeah. That's it.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Excellent. That's good.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so as far as the, the, the questions are really straightforward, just yes or no responses will do. It's about about 5-6 minutes anyway. If you have any questions along the way, just interrupt me and ask me. No problem.
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[8 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Umm, before we get into the application, I, I did want to bring one piece up you might already be aware of, but I just want to be Full disclosure, full honesty here with you is that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age on, umm, obviously. But in addition, this, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. And you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year. That's your choice, Helen. But I'll give you an indication using our premium projection tool. So at least you have an idea about it comes about, umm, you know the directions going. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $164.83 a fortnight, but your benefit amount will have increased to $525,000. Now you can also find information about our premium structure on our website, but regardless, we're gonna end up sending you updated policy schedules before your policy anniversary review lead letting you know of any changes that were being in a fully transparent with you as to those movements as well.

[9 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Most, most insurers do the same.
[9 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Umm, let's, let's, uh, enter it there.
[9 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : So we can always adjust it if we if we're struggling as well.
[9 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : And I would just just say if we, uh, if we, if you, if you've got to a point where you wanted to, to lower the level of color, that's possible as well. Depending on your age and subject to eligibility you can give us a quantity lower.
[10 minutes][Customer] : So, yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : That's fine, but as far as the questions that's all that's left to do.

[28 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic. Alrighty, so let's bring that up for you. I'll, I'll take you through umm, the, the life insurance policy may bring you up to speed essentially. So with that one, uh, it's, they're designed to provide a financial protection for your loved ones and then through that lump sum payment, you can go ahead and use that money for whatever they need to when the time comes.
[29 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : None.
[28 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : And, and as far as what we can offer you, I'll bring up the minimum maximum and you tell me which level of cover, uh, would be suitable for you. But we have to ask to begin with, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[29 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : No.
[29 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Very good. OK, well, there for yourself, you can choose anywhere from $100,000 of cover up to maximum of $500,000 based on your age. Umm, So what?
[29 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Could you just excuse me a minute? What sort of cover am I supposed to be asking for 350,000 please?
[29 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure, absolutely no problem. So you'd like me to quote you on the 350,000? No problem. And now with the policy, how it works. Before we look at those numbers, I'll just explain to you. Really easy to apply for, we'll just ask you the questions over the phone. Take 5 minutes and if you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months. In addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we'll pay your claim in full and you can use that money for whatever you need to before you pass away, cover the medical costs, whatever needs to be taken care of, you can use that money full. And also there we also include a $10,000 advance payment to help with the funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time as well. OK. Does that all make sense to you? Yeah, Over $350,000 of life insurance cover, that would work out to be a fortnightly premium of $96.09 per fortnight. Is that manageable for you?
[30 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it is $96.
[30 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : And nine cents a fortnight?
[30 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK. Just hold the line. That's OK with you. That is satisfactory. Thank you.
[30 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Sure, no problem. Perfect. With the policy, I also wanted to mention to you that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as your age. And in addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will increase by 5% associated increases in premium. You can opt out of this automatic indexation each year, that's your choice. But I'll give you an indication that's what it could look like out of track. But as an indication, if you make their changes to the policy, a premium next year, it'll be $115.38 a fortnight, but your benefit amount will have increased to $367,500. OK. And you can also find information about our premium struct from our website. But regardless, we're going to send you out updated policy schedules before your policy. And it is reviewing letting you have any changes that are being fully transparent with you as to those minutes. No problem.
[31 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
