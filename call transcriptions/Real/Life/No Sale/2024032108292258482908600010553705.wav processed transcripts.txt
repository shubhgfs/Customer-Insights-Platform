[8 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[10 seconds][Agent] : Hi, my name is George. I'm calling from Real Insurance. How are you going today?
[14 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I'm good. Thanks. How are you?
[16 seconds][Agent] : Good. Thank you. I was wondering if Andrew was available.
[19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, you're after me, Julie. I'm just doing it in his name because that's what I want the quote on.
[25 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. Yeah, sure. Let me just bring up some pricing here. Can I just get you to reconfirm Andrew's full name and date of birth for me, please?
[33 seconds][Customer] : 17th of the 3rd 76.
[36 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. He's a male Australian resident. Thank you and I will let you know. All calls are recorded. Any advice that provide this to me or nature may not be suitable to your situation.
[38 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[47 seconds][Agent] : And what's got you looking into life insurance for him?
[50 seconds][Customer] : Oh, he's just changed jobs and things, and we were just thinking about all the things that we should do and this came up.
[56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course not. Understandable. And is it more so just to cover like a mortgage or leave some extra money behind, a family, anything in particular?
[1 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, a bit of both, Yeah. Cover the mortgage and the cost. Yeah.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Sort of both, Yeah, definitely. Well, with the life insurance here at will, we don't actually have any restrictions on how that money needs to be used. And he has the option of nominating up to five beneficiaries.
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right. OK.
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Of course you can have just one sole beneficiary, but he has the option of adding more if you would like how to actually apply for the life insurance. Like I can take you through how it all works in pricing, but if he wants to apply for it, I just have to take him through his health and lifestyle question to see if it's something he's eligible for. The health questions will determine if the premium changes at all, but also his eligibility as well. Now once we go through those with him, if he's accepted and he decides to commence the policy, he'll actually be covered immediately for death due to any cause.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right. Yep.
[1 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months and there's two better.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So sorry. It was covered immediately with no wait. Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yes, besides the 13 months suicide exclusion, Yeah, that's right. So once he's approved and he sets up the policy, he's covered for death due to any other cause besides suicide. Now the life insurance actually comes with two built in benefits, So the first would be a $10,000 advance payout for funeral costs.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So it can help out with those immediate expenses while we're processing the rest of the claim. And then there's also a terminally ill advanced payment as well.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yes. OK. Yep.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So if he was diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, which hopefully that would never happen, but would pay the claim out while he's still living to help with then find medical costs now. Any questions before we go through pricing?
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : No, no, that sounds about right.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Has Andrew had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[3 minutes][Customer] : No.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : No Beautiful. Definitely brings the premiums down which is good and cover ranges between 100,000 up to 750,000. What amount do you want to have a look at first?
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : I'd say 500.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, let's have a look.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : It's hard to know, isn't it?
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Just as yeah. And I mean, it is a flexible cover as well. I mean, if you were to start on one level of cover, you can always apply subject to eligibility for a top up cover or increase the coverage or reduce the benefit amount.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : But I mean, if you're looking at it to cover a mortgage and some other expenses, at least a mortgage gives you a sort of an idea of, you know, how much coverage you would need sort of minimum and then add on however much coverage you think you would need on top of that.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Also would like to mention with the flexibility of the cover as the mortgage comes down, you may not need the amount that you originally started off with, which also means you can apply to reduce it just to stay in line with what you are needing to cover down the track.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So we'll use a 500,000 as a starting point anyway. We can look way up or down from there. So the fortnightly premium would be $50.71. So it's every two weeks. How's that sounding?
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that sounds alright.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yep. How did you want to look at any other amounts? We go by levels of 50,000.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : We'll do the no that, that's fine.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. Well with this one L, like I mentioned, just with Andrew, we would have to go through his health questions. Is he available now or?
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : No, not home at the moment.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, That's fine. Yeah. So you've got two options. You can either do a joint policy or two single policies.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Do you do a couples run as well or not right?
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : The main difference is if you were to do a joint policy, it's the same price as having two separate. The main difference though is a joint policy. The premiums would come out as just one premium. We add them both together. So it's not 2 separate premiums being debited. But also with the joint policy, there'll be 1 main life insured and there'll be a second life insured. The main life insured can nominate up to five beneficiaries.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : The second life insured can only have one and it is a default, the main life insured. So if you did want to have more control over your policies in terms of beneficiaries and things like that, you can do 2 separate or you can have a joint policy that you just have to decide who would be the main life insured.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : But there's no real financial benefit in doing that then, is there?
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : No, it's the same price regardless. So if it's two separate policies, it's just two separate premiums being debited. A joint policy would just add both those premiums together.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah, Yeah, OK. Alright.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Do you wanna, I'm happy to give you pricing for yourself. Do you want me to?
[6 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, I'm while you're there.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. What's your date of birth?
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll get you to do that.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And your full name.
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : 13th of the 6th 80 Julie's in Socha.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : And you are a female Australian resident, is that right? I think. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Beautiful. So I'm just bringing up the pricing now it's just loading. So same amount's between 100,000 up to 750,000. Did you want to look at the 500,000 for yourself as well?
[6 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No. Do 300 for that one please.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yes, OK, let's have a look. I've just had a look here due to your age, because you are a couple of years younger you're and like eligibility for the amount of coverage between 100,000 up to 1,000,000 actually, but we'll have a look at the 300,000 which is $18.46 per fortnight.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Right. Thanks again. With all these policies, each year that you age, your plan is gonna go up.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Correct. So the premium is a steps premium on our life insurance. So it means it will generally increase each year as you age. The policy does also include though an automatic indexation. So it means that each year the sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premiums. However, you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year. So again, it's just more flexibility with the cover. There will be a standard increase your regardless as you are aging. So the every 12 months there will be a standard increase to the premium. However, if you would like a 5% increase on how much you've been insured for.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, OK.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So for the first year 300,000, there would be an additional increase as we've provided more coverage the following year. So it is optional.
[8 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah.
[8 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : You can decline it each year and just leave it at the 300,000 or you can swap and change it each year depending.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : OK. And roughly what is the increase each year as per per age?
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, and let's have a look. So the just bringing it up now. OK, so this is without the automatic indexation. So this is just the standard increase each year?
[8 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's OK. I I don't think I'm interested in that so.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's fine. So next year, so I quoted originally for your husband as $50.71 per fortnight. His would be $57.93 per fortnight the following year. Yours for the first year was $18.46 per fortnight. The following year is $21.18 per fortnight.
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : OK, alright.
[9 minutes][Agent] : So that's leaving it on the same amount. Sorry, give me one second. My apologies. The computer was having it as the increase to the benefit amount as well. So I apologize throughout that.
[9 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Your husband's would be $55.18 per fortnight, so just under a $5 increase and yours would be $20.17, about $1.80 difference the following year.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK, alright. That sounds reasonable.
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So I'll save this one. I'll. So would you be interested in the both of you or more so just your husband at this point? Yeah, that's perfectly fine. Well, what I'll do is I'll, I've got an e-mail here, so it is fletchidoublela@gmail.com.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Maybe both, yeah. Fletcher at Gmail.
[9 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. I'm going to send this out to you just so you can have a sit down and discuss it with Andrew. It'll have the figures on there and I'll put a disclosure statement. When would be the best time? I can give you a call back when you are both together.
