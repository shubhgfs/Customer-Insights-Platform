[1 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : AALICEN, Rosario ROZARIO, 19th of the 12th, 1978.
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much. Now, just so you're aware of both of you calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. Umm, and if you miss my name, it's Cameron. I'm obvious obviously from your insurance. Now, just my understanding, understanding. Listen, have you ever held a life insurance with us or anyone else before?
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm. No, no, no, I haven't.
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Or is this something you brand new to? OK. So what we're going to do today is take you through a bit of information about how the cover works. I'll share some pricing with you to make sure that we've got an option, an option that fits your budget. And assuming we find the right fit for you, we'll then be able to confirm your eligibility through a short series of health and lifestyle questions. Assuming we get that approval in place, we'll then be able to start some cover for you and send out documents future review.
[2 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, now I do have a profile on my system that looks like it may have been from an enquiry that was made early in December. I'm wondering if this is you so there's an e-mail here. Would you be able to confirm your e-mail for me? Do you have another e-mail that might have been used?
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : My e-mail e-mail is alishe@y7mail.com that shouldbemywifesitsalishe13@yahoo.com dot AU.
[2 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Ah, that's what I've got here. OK, so it looks like you should pop the inquiry in for you now. Do you want me to update that e-mail to your e-mail address? oksothatwasalishe@gmail.com, 0ysorryy7mail.com. OK. And with respect to a contact number, what's the best contact number for you, Allison?
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, please at white7mail.com 0428870601.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Thank you very much. And of course, you're a male Australian resident, correct?
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, that's right.
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Now with the cover, how much were you ideally wanting to be insured for? Is there a specific purpose, for example, are you worried about covering off something like a mortgage rather other sort of financial commitments?
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Uh, yes, but I'm not sure about the amounts though. I would say 600,000, maybe 5 to 600,000.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, somewhere between 5 and 600 now. Sure.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yes. Mm, Hmm.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : And serene. I, I just wanna forewarn you both that one of the determining factors of the cost is age and another determining factor is gender. Men are generally more expensive to insure than women. So I, I don't want you guys to be shocked that the pricing is probably going to be different. So the, uh, between the two of you, umm, but we'll load it up.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : We'll have a look now. Alizen, your smoking status, please, may I? Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Thank you. And that's going to be another factor as well, just to be clear. Now, of course, you can always get that reviewed down the line. If, for example, you give up smoking and you want to get that review, call our support team and I'll check it for you at any stage. OK.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yes, sure.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Now the other thing I just want to quickly confirm is your annual income. So is your current annual income $50,000 or greater?
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Umm, higher between 70 and 90? Yep.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, Which means that we are able to look at the full range of cover for you. So you've got a range of 100,000 as a minimum to 1.5 thou, 1.5 million as a maximum. It goes up and down in increments of $50,000. So if you'd like me to, I can start at say for example of 50, the $500,000.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : We'll have a look at what that looks like. If you want to go higher or lower, just let me know.
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : MMM.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now, umm, in terms of how the cover works, so obviously showing you've got cover with us, but just for reference point for you, it's a, a straightforward process. We just provide that financial protection of your loved ones through a lump sum payment. If you were to pass away, it could be used for whatever your loved ones wish. We don't dictate in any shape or form how that money's utilized. Umm, you simply nominate up to five beneficiaries and the amount you want to leave to each of them. And that's how we'll distribute the, uh, benefit amount that you've nominated. Now it, it includes in the cover an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to a maximum of $20,000 to help with upfront costs, for example, Funeral arrangements. But it could be any costs that your family may face at that time or your loved ones may face at that time. So whether that seems like legal fees, transportation costs, living costs, it's entirely up to them. The intention of that advance payment is simply to remove any financial pressure from your loved ones while they're waiting for the full claim to be processed. As I've said to you, we keep it nice and simple with respect to the application. It's all done over the phone through some helpful questions. There's no need for you to do any other checks.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Assuming we get that approval in place and you're happy with the terms and conditions conditions, we can get the, the policy started immediately for you. If there is no specific, uh, conditions placed on the policy, you'll then be immediately covered to death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. And of course, if that's not the case, I'll indicate it once we've got the, uh, approval in place. Umm, and the cover also includes a terminally ill advanced payment, again, specific to your terms and conditions. So we'll go through those questions and then verify what that looks like for you.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK, Any questions so far?
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : No. All good.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, great. So loading up the cost, we're looking at for $500,000 uh, cost per fortnight of $99.34. The cost structure is linear. So as you have the amount, you have the cost. As you double the amount, you double the cost. So as a starting point of the 500,000, does that fit into the budget for you guys?
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : That's fine.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : You're both happy with it.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yes.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you so much. So I I'm through this process. I need to make sure I'm getting buy in from you as in because you are gonna be the person being insured.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, of course.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So at any stage if 3 answers on your behalf, I'm not trying to be rude at all to insure and I just need to make sure that it's an agreement from from both sides. OK.
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Thanks so much. Now with the next steps, I'm going to take you through those questions. Now when we go through the medical questions, it has to be a answered directly by the person who's being insured. We've been told strictly that we're not allowed to receive any coaching from the background. I know sometimes your partner knows you're better than yourself, but just if you wouldn't mind refraining from answering any of these questions, Irene, that would be really appreciated. Thank you so much.

[15 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Congratulations and again, you've been fully approved without any amendments to the terms and conditions of the policy.

As I said to you, once that approval's in place and you decide to commit to policy, you'll be covered to death due to any cause accepted suicide in the 1st 13 months. It includes that terminally ill advanced payment, which means that if you're diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we can pay the full claim to you directly in order to try and assist you with any of the costs you may have, hopefully give you the best chance of upcoming the diagnosis. Knock on wood, obviously, hopefully never. With your premium, it's stepped, it's going to generally increase each year at your age. In addition, with the policy, it has what's called automatic indexation, which means each of your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium until you reach the maximum from out until the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday. Now, you're not obliged to keep the indexation in, so you can opt out of this automatic indexation when we send out renewal forms each year if you'd like to. As an indication, just to show you how that works, if you were to make no changes to the policy, your premium in the next year would be $112.92 a fortnight, with the benefit rising to $525,000. If you didn't want to see that rise, you can leave it out. Your benefit will stay at the $500,000 and subsequently your premiums will be a little bit cheaper. But please understand, you should still expect them to generally increase each year as you age, OK?
