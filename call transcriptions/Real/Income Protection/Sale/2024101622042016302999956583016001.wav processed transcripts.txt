[1 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[2 seconds][Agent] : Hi Tricia, it's Matt calling you from Real Insurance. How you going?
[5 seconds][Customer] : Not too bad. Thank you. Yes.
[5 seconds][Agent] : The reason for my call as we can see on our website, they're having a look into some income protection. So here to provide you with the pricing and information on that one there. So I'm just, I'm just to let you know that all of our calls are recorded. Any advice that I do provide is general nature and may not be suitable to your situation. And can I confirm I'm speaking to Tricia? And then how do I pronounce your last name?
[24 seconds][Customer] : Yes, you are McClain.
[28 seconds][Agent] : Thank you.
[33 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's correct.
[29 seconds][Agent] : And your date of birth is the 16th of the 1st 1978 and you are a female Australian president.
[36 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[37 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. So that I can assist you there this morning, what's made you sort of think now is the time to look into that income protection for yourself?
[45 seconds][Customer] : Well, pretty much my parents talking me into doing it.
[49 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah, yeah. Not a problem at all. So what are you mainly looking to cover with that income protection? Is there like a mortgage in place or is it just sort of to cover everyday living costs if you are unable to work?
[48 seconds][Customer] : So I think, yeah, I think it's just sort of a back up plan just in case something was to happen or yeah, yeah, just everyday living, like car payments and rent, things like that.
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Of course. Yeah, not a problem at all. You know, the income person can be used for whatever purpose and obviously you need to do obviously help cover for your bills and living costs if your salary is interrupted, obviously during the time that you are unable to work due to that disabling sickness or an injury.
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So look what that cover is gonna do for the income protection. As I said, there is, it's there to provide if you were unable to work due to what does a disabling sickness or an injury and you suffer a loss of income. Umm, now as long as you work 15 hours per week in paid employment, you can apply for the income protection. Then what it can do is help cover for any of your bills or living cost if your salary is interrupted during the time that you are unable to work. Now what we offer here is an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. Now that benefit amount will be salary dependent, so it's how much you would make as an annual premium. That's what then will determine how much you would be eligible for the income protection. Then what we do is ask you some health and lifestyle questions over the phone to see if we can get you approved and if so, on what terms we can offer it to you now. Once it's in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Please keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS. Now, I'm not sure if you've ever looked into income protection before, but if you haven't have a bit of pace in mind that with the premiums that you pay for income protection, they are generally tax deductible there as well. So it can actually make it a bit more cost effective for you when it does come down to the obviously the time to apply for that, uh, your income protection tax rule. Umm, so that is tax deductible for you there. Umm, so let's take you through the seven duties based assessment questions that all that does is just outline and check what you do based on your job there. So it says before answering any of our questions, it is important that you're aware of your GD to answer all of our questions accurately. And obviously failure to do so, it could impact your cover claims time. Now, do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, I do.
[3 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : And is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature? We spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Well, it's a bit of both.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : I'm AI manage a disability group home but I still I take my clients out into the into the public and stuff as well like for appointments and things.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep, that's fine. So what? So would you say a majority of the time is indoors or is it going to be outdoors? What what do you feel the majority?
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Probably the majority indoors.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. We'll say yes to that one for that one. And are you required to perform any physical duties? So physical duties means the use of, ah, lifting, lowering, pushing, pulling, throwing, carrying or otherwise moving, holding or restraining or operating machinery. OK, and do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation is a pilot of crew, entertainment industry, Air Force, army, armed forces. Or do you carry a firearm or handle explosives? Thank you.

[3 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Oh well, I'm self-employed.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Now with that current employment there, are you currently employed or self-employed Seven point, no problem at all. So what we deem is the pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts less any business expense and excluding super contributions. This is the amount of the business but otherwise cease earning in the event that you were unable to work due to a disability. So it says here, what is your annual pre tax income there? Yep, not a problem at all. Pop in 80,000. Umm now with this one here. So based on your duties and income, you can set a monthly benefit amount anywhere from $1000 per month. Umm, it's just gonna load up to the maximum of $4666.00 paid directly there to you per month. So what benefit amount would you like me to quote you on? The maximum? Yep. OK, it's working for the maximum now. The waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured events. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in a raise. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So which benefit. Would you like? I'm sorry, which waiting period would you like me to select from?
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : I'm looking about 80,000, the four 4060, yeah, I'll go 30 days.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : A 30 or a 90 day, 30 days. Now the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefits for anyone injury or illness. Now you can choose anywhere from six months on the two years or five year benefit. So which benefit. Would you like me to select?
