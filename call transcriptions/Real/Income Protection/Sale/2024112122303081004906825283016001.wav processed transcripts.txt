[1 seconds][Customer] : Hello, Linda.
[2 seconds][Agent] : Hi, Belinda, it's Joel giving you a call back from Real. How you going?
[2 seconds][Customer] : Speaking well, thank you yourself.
[7 seconds][Agent] : That's good. Yeah, very well. Thank you for asking. I was just calling back because the underwriter did come back to me with an outcome. So I just wanted to let you know your options.
[14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[14 seconds][Agent] : I just have to quickly say all that calls are recorded. Any advice provided is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. And just for compliance to please confirm your name and date of birth. Yep. And just your first and last name, please.
[24 seconds][Customer] : 24th of August 1970 Linda Karen Jones.
[32 seconds][Agent] : That's the one. Thanks so much. So just jumping back to what the underwriter said. So they actually made no changes to the referral. So yeah, you have been fully approved. And yet the underwriter didn't change anything.
[42 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[41 seconds][Agent] : So all the terms and conditions stayed exactly the same as what we spoke about yesterday.
[45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[46 seconds][Agent] : So for here right now, that means the ball's in your court.
[48 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[48 seconds][Agent] : Now, you do have a couple of options. So I can definitely e-mail you out what we call an online activation e-mail.
[54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[54 seconds][Agent] : So once you review the information, if you do decide to proceed with it within the next 30 days, you can activate it yourself or whenever you're ready.
[1 minutes][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[1 minutes][Agent] : The other option we offer all our customers, if it is something that you are generally interested in, I can organize to send you out all the policy documentation for you to have a read through and review.
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : The difference being, if we do, that means we would start covering straight away just in case that we wouldn't actually take any payments at this stage.
[1 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[1 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Essentially all we do just to get the ball rolling, just attach your preferred method of payment that you can choose a start date in the future that works for you. However, of course, once you did review the policy, if there's anything you don't like or even if you just decided not to proceed with it, of course that's fine. You're not obligated to keep it. Policy does come with a full 30 day cooling off period from that first payment date as well. I'll be honest, Linda, I'm guided by you in this situation. Would you be interested in me setting up the policy and sending it out for you to read through?
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, look, that's probably the best option. I think I'm a bit of a paper person.
[1 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah, sure.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Plus my partner, he, he's up in Tamworth. I won't be seeing him until next week as well.
[1 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Right. OK, I'm sure.
[1 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : So we can sort of sit down at our leisure and and have a good look.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely. That's fine. I can do that. So we do post you out a hard copy which you should receive in about two to five business days.
[2 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Umm, we do also e-mail you a copy which will come through in about 10 to 15 minutes as well.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Mm Hmm.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So just confirm, since we spoke yesterday, has your contact information changed at all or is that still the same?
[2 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : No.
[2 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Not perfect. And with the health and lifestyle questions that we went through, all the answers still the same.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. All right, so we'll organize at this stage for the $5000 a month with a 30 day waiting period and a two year benefit. Just to reconfirm, that was coming in at $178.15 per fortnight.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : As I mentioned, we don't take any payments today, but just so that we can cover you in the interim, we just attach your preferred method of payment and you can choose a start date in the future, anywhere up to 30 days away. Umm, did you want to set that up using your bank account or a Visual MasterCard?
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, probably a bank account.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, we can note that down for now. Now let's quickly jump onto that screen. Won't be 1 moment, sorry. It's just it's taking a moment to load. There we go. Was yours a savings account or a cheque account? Is that just your name on the account and all we need is just the BSB and the account number please?
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Savings, yes, BSB 815000 and account number 56950.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yep, thanks very much. Now as I mentioned, you can choose whatever day you'd like the payments to start anywhere within the next 30 days, so I'm happy to give you as much time as you need to have a chat to your partner and have a read through. Umm, when would you like me to schedule the start date at this point?
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, let me just hang on.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Sorry.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Take your time. No, you're all right. Yeah, take your time. That's fine.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I'm just checking my calendar is the 10th of December, is that in the 30 days?
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely. Let me grab my calendar. I'll push it back to the 10th, see how that works out. Well, I'll push it back. So that'll give you so.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Hang on, hang on. Sorry. Give me a SEC.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, sure.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, the 17th.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : 17, Yeah, I can do that. That's fine. 17, that works out, that's fine. So that means you'll still be covered straight away from the end of this call that you weren't paying anything until the 17th. So you'll have roughly about 3 weeks worth of cover, which we're not going to back charge you for.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : That'll give you 3 weeks to decide if you are happy with it and you wanted to stay in force. You won't have to do anything. The policy will just stay active in the first payment will come out on the 17. So effectively your policy starts on the 17th of December. There's any issues or if you just decide not to go ahead with it, just give us a call back before the 17th.
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : We'll just apply to cancel it for you and that's as far as it'll go.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, great.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : All righty now all I have to do just to get that finalized for you just need 2 minutes of your time just to read out a final declaration and then just ask for your agreements with at the end.
