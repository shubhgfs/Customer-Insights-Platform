[1 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah.
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So I'll run into what income protection insurance is. I mean, it sounds probably a little bit obvious based on the name of it, but there are some different features and benefits that I'll let you know about. And just to clarify, so you said you've been looking around, you've been having a bit of trouble getting it. Let's just see if that's an issue on our end straight away so I don't waste your time, of course.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : What was the reason for that? You aren't able to get it usually.
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Because I got like those with ulceritis, colitis, like a, it's like a, it's like a minor form of it. It's like only it's like Titus or something.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, so ulceritis. Colitis, did you say it's called?
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Let me have a look.
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : And I think that's why I keep getting knocked back. But I, I need to get some sort of cover like that for my work. So I just if you have any advice on how I can go about it that would be great.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Hmm. So it's it's in regards to Bell, look, there's there's a section the underwriting questions that have Bell in there. I guess we could just list it there might just refer if there is a decline, of course, I'll just let you know. But based on what you're telling me now, I mean, I'm, I don't have an answer to that. I think it might even just be an exclusion potentially, but the best way to find out is just to go through the process and then see how you go.
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah, right.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So I'll guide you through a page and then when we get to that, our question, we'll go from there.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's Missus. I got married a week ago.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and would you prefer the title on the profile being Miss Misses or miss? Oh, nice. How good, how exciting. I got married in October. So we're both freshly married.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Busy time to get married. Yeah. Christmas.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : It is, it is so, umm, I've got Mrs. Paige McGowan SE uh, seventh of the 5th 1996 and then the e-mail paigemcgowan1234@outlook.com. So yeah, you may need to hear getting this just because it's a requirement for work. That's fine. I hear it pretty often. So when it comes to income protection insurance, uh, it's ultimately paying a monthly income benefit directly to you. If you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. Umm, it's then designed to help cover your bills and living costs in a unfortunate situation.
[3 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Salary is interrupted, umm, when it comes to paying the premiums for this, I'll assure the pricing soon, But as long as you can keep up with those premiums, when it comes down to tax return, uh, each year, the premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible, which can make it even more cost effective for you.
[3 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Great. Yep.
[3 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, so when it comes to that time of year, we can provide you with the relevant documentation that you'd need in order to sort out the tax side of things.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Great.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Now, umm, we offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000 of cover. Very easy to apply for. No medical checks or blood tests required.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yes, you did let me know about that disclosure of the ulcerated colitis, something that's pronounced, UMM, that one there. We'll find out in the application, of course, if you're approved, umm, and if you know, if you're happy with it, then it can cover you into your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday.
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Great.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So I know you're only 28, but just letting you know that that's how long you can have this policy in place if you need to, Umm, and keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in PDS and depending on how you answer the health and lifestyle questions, further exclusions can apply. Then I'll of course let you know about those if that, uh, is the case.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Bye. Yep.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Now in regards to the, umm, your occupation, I should say we do a duty based assessment. So that's, that's basically just a few yes or no questions surrounding your occupation to give us an idea. And then umm, we'll continue from there. So first of all, can I please confirm that you are a female Australian resident?
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And in regards to the duty based assessment, before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Failure to do so could impact your coverage claims time.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, so the first question that I see is you want it just says do you work 15 hours or more per week? Yes or no? Thank you.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep, yes.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment yes or no thank you. Do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery, or drive a vehicle?
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yes or no thank you. Sorry next question says are you qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role?
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yes or no Thank you. Do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, army, armed forces or do you handle explosives? Yes or no, thank you. Do you regularly work underground or underwater? Worker heights above 10 metres, work offshore or carry a firearm? Yes or no?
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So that's the duty based assessment complete. So thank you for your patience while I went through that.
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Just going to the next part now. OK, now for your current occupation, are you currently employed or self-employed?
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : self-employed.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So the reason I ask is because we give a definition of what pre tax income is.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts. So that's any business expenses and excluding super contributions. This is the amount that the business would otherwise cease earning in the event you are unable to work due to a disability. So currently what's your annual income before tax? 2:20 Yep.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep, about 220 thousand, yeah.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So 220,000. And for your smokers status, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, no, I've had a baby though.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Vape. OK. And for the monthly benefit amount you can choose between $1000 being the minimum up to a maximum of $12,833 for the maximum. So between and this is based on your duties and income, so between $1000 up to 12,833. What monthly benefit amount would you like me to quote you on?
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : What?
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK, let's have a look.
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : So maybe like 10,000, yeah.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So for the $10,000 monthly benefit amount, we can look at a waiting period of 30 days or 90 days for this insurance. So the waiting period's a non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured.
[8 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Of that as I said you can choose 30 days and 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So which waiting period would you like me to select for you out of 30 days or 90 days?
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Oh, maybe, maybe just do 30 days.
[8 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : 30 days is more expensive, 9 days is the lower cost, but obviously it's because of the waiting period aspect. So 30 days did you say?
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Just do 30 days, yeah.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Now the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So you can choose six months, one year, two years or five years. So which benefit. Would you like me to select?
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Maybe 2.
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Let's have a look. OK, so if we're looking at a $10,000 monthly benefit amount, there's a 30 day waiting period and a two year benefit. Fortnightly. The premium for that would be $141.54 per fortnight if you want to go with that amount.
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : If you want to drop that cost, 90 days waiting period brings it down to $73.07 a fortnight. And then further there a one year benefit. In in conjunction with the 90 days brings it to $51.96 fortnight for the 10,000 of cover. So you can see that you know, adjusting those bits and pieces adjust the premium.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, maybe we'll do. I can. Can I do the sorry, can I just change it to 90 days waiting period for the two years cover or the two? Yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : But as I said, is yeah, that's fine, of course. So we got a 90 day waiting period with a 2 year benefit. And a $10,000 monthly benefit amount. You'd be looking at a fortnightly premium of $73.07 a fortnight.
[9 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[10 minutes][Agent] : Uh, of course, as long as you can maintain those payments, you know, when it comes down to tax return, then of course we umm, provide you with that relevant documentation you need so you can organize the tax side of things as the premiums for income protection insurance are generally tax deductible.
[10 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, now we'll go for the health and lifestyle question. See how you go. Umm, if there's pre-existing conditions, generally they're exclusions for those kind of things. So just keep that in mind.
[10 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but yeah, we'll see how we go and hopefully get the outcome you're looking for. Umm, another thing to note with this insurance is it's not just about providing a monthly income benefit to pay for those bills and living costs, but it's also about getting you back to work so that you're, so that you're able to, umm, they're making a regular income again. So there is a rehabilitation benefit included, which means that it pays a reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit to a maximum of $3000 to help with rehabilitation costs whilst claiming, or we can reimburse up to six times your income benefit towards cost of equipment or modifications required to assist your return to work.
[10 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, yeah.
[11 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So that's also part of it as well.
[11 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Great.
[11 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Now, uh, what's your post code for your home address? OK, 225 O in the suburb Wyoming. Yep.
[11 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : 2250 Wyoming A 100A Glenny St. 110 Glenny St.
[11 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : And the street address and the number 110. Oh yeah, I see it. Glenny Street. Is that your postal address?
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : which is gle Yeah.
[11 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Umm, and you also do get a final expenses benefit with this policy. Not a very exciting topic. It's, it's if you were to unfortunately pass away under this policy, then we can pay $10,000 to your beneficiaries in that unfortunate event so that they can use it for medical, for funeral cost, etcetera. In that unfortunate situation. Now, umm, your premium is stepped, which means that it will generally increase each of your age.
[11 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[12 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : We do like to give a premium projection of that. Umm, you'll see what I mean in a second. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year would be $74.07 per fortnight for the $10,000 monthly benefit amount with a 90 day waiting period and a two year benefit.
[12 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : What?
[12 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So that would be going from $73.07 a fortnight to $74.07 a fortnight.
[12 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Your following year of cover, umm, the year after that in 2026 will be $74.54 per fortnight, OK Umm, please be aware that all of our premium projections are indicative only and assume that you do not make any amendments to your cover. That's just an example for you. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website if you need to. Anyway, I just like to go over to some people on the phone.
[12 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[12 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now we'll go into those health and lifestyle questions for you. I'm just going to read you a short paragraph prior. It simply explains what's expected of myself and ask you these questions, what's expected of yourself and answering them.
[13 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : And, uh, if you get the outcome that you're looking for, then we can organize the policy for you over the phone very easily. And then following your first policy anniversary date, we actually give you a refund of $189.98 if you were to go for this monthly benefit amount, umm waiting period and benefit. For the fortnightly premium of $73.07. OK, now do you have any questions for me before I hop into the health and lifestyle questions? No, it's all clear at the moment.

[26 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, right.
[26 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And it may affect your Max benefit amount as well. Sometimes conditions like that, it's still actually the insurance, but it reduces it to uh. I think the maximum is about $5000.
[26 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's OK. Yeah. Yeah.
[26 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So just keep that in mind as well, but we'll have a look and see uh and mind you that will of course force your price to also uh come down as well because you're looking at a lower benefit amount.
[27 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[27 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Umm and in regards to like I said, maybe so you haven't had a cigarette in the last 12 months, you just to vape umm, so you've, you've vaped in the last 12 months Yep. So vaping with the like nicotine vapes, etcetera, it's still considered in the same category as smoking. Yeah.
[27 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah.
[27 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : The funny thing is, umm, when it comes to smoking status on this, cigars don't, but vaping and cigarettes do, uh, both considered like soaking. So, umm, mind you, that's already been factored because I told you anyway, earliest to keep that in mind.
[27 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[27 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : But if you do go a period of umm, 12 months without a vape or cigarette, etcetera, for a 12 month period, you can call up to the plot of your smoker status review.
[27 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[27 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, now, so your application is approved with the below terms. So I'll read this over with you now. Uh, and then we'll, we'll have a look and reevaluate that cost and see what it is.
[27 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Perfect.
[27 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So, umm, the Max benefit amount and benefit. Has been updated. So the Max benefit amount is $5000 and the Max benefit. Is 2 years. Mind you, we didn't, I don't think we even looked over two years anyway. We had it for two years. So it's just your Max benefit amount is 5000, OK. And as I said, the Max benefit of benefit. Is 2 years. Now this is due based on the disclosure of the ulcerative colitis from the underwriting application, OK. Now again based on the disclosure of ulcerative colitis, the application, the following exclusion applies. So it's the ulcerative colitis exclusion. So no benefit will be payable for any disability, condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to or arising from ulcerative colitis. OK, umm and then of course, let's have a look at the premium adjustments, if that's had an update as well. So there is a premium adjustment due to ulcerative colitis. I think that's the 30 quotes updated premium. OK, So the premium fortnightly is mind you, this is $5000 monthly benefit amount within 90 day waiting period and a two year benefit.
[28 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[29 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, So this fortnightly premium, umm, has been, has come down based on the disclosure of the ulcerative colitis application. We brought it to 40, $5.51 fortnight. Umm, of course, because it's brought down your Max benefit amount. OK, that's, that's also a factor. Umm, bear with me. So yeah, so $5000 monthly benefit amount with a 90 day waiting period and a two year benefit. It's $45.51 a fortnight, umm, and you get a refund of $118.32 paid back to you following your first policy anniversary date.
[29 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[29 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, I already gave you a premium projection early, uh, earlier. But seeing as, I mean, I've got you here and we've already finished the application, I'm also gonna give you another one.

[29 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[29 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $46.13 per fortnight.
