[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : OK, that's right. Yeah.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So the process that we have for the income protection, it's basically health and lifestyle questions that you go through.

[2 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : And then at the end it will tell us if you're approved and if and if so on what terms we can offer cover for you, OK?

[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Keep in mind that there are some exclusions that applies outlined in the PDS as well for you.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK. So what I'll do here, Feidi is let me bring up the pricing and then we'll go through those options available because with their income protection, you can select certain options to suit your needs and to customize it.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So let me just bring up the first part here for you. So just basically that I'll need to ask you some questions regarding your duties at work. And before answering any of our questions, Feidi, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all of our questions accurately and honestly.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's right.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Umm, failure to do so could impact recovery claims time. Now, first of all, do you work 15 hours or more per week? Yes or no?
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Is your role of an administrative, managerial, or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment, yes or no? Uh.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah. I just to clarify this question, I am computer professional, I'm developer.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. So in that case, yes. So this is asking as a whole question anyway. I'm not asking if it's just all of them, but even if it's either of them.
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : So I'm an office and working from home and this stuff's yeah, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment? So I'll just reconfirm that would be yes or no?
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : And are you required to perform any physical duties, yes or no? And do you work in any of the following fields, aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces or do you handle also or do you carry a firearm or handle explosives? Yes or no?
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : No, No.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : If you said yes, I'd be wondering what kind of IT work you did.
[5 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, that's right.
[5 minutes][Agent] : So yeah, yeah. Was that's coming up there Friday. Can I also confirm with yourself there, Sir? Have you had a cigarettes in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : No.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : And with your current employment status Friday can I also confirm are you currently employed or self-employed now? The reason why we ask that Friday is because we need to confirm what your annual pre tax income is to help determine what level of cover you're eligible to apply for now letting you know that being employed pre tax income is the total annual remuneration paid to you or you're employed before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses, excluding super contributions. OK, yes. So what is your annual pre tax income? Yes, not before tax 123,000 per year. Beautiful. Now Friday is just.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Employed true be before tax right Yeah 123K yeah, yeah this is with this is without bonus. The bonus is around three, 3500 on top of it.
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK. So let me have a look here for you. So is that bonus that's a regular Commission or regular bonus that you receive each year? OK. So you can actually add that on file based on that description that I actually mentioned to you, because as long as it's a regular Commission or bonus, then it's something that you can actually add on to that salary if you like. So it's 123,000 + 3 1/2 thousand, is that correct?
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's correct.
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. Yes, so let's do that. That way it will give us some more accurate pricing of and, and in terms of the monthly benefit amount. So Friday I can let you know that based on your duties and income, you can select a monthly benefit amount from $1000 up to a maximum of $7378.
[6 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : That's on a monthly basis.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So what amount would you like me to quote you on at this stage? Friday?
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK. Can you see the maximum first?
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so 7378 dollars. OK, beautiful. Umm, and letting you know the is that because you want to just play around with the different options available?
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, that's all good. Umm, And there's two other options there for you that you can select which we can play around for you as well. But just as a starting point, there's also a waiting period now to let you know that the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is paid after the insured event. Now with the C Friday, you can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind income benefits paid monthly in arrears. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be six days after your first eligible to claim. Second, I confirm which waiting period would you like me to select for you? The 30 days or the 90 days, please?
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : So for confirmation the 30 days over 90 days, this is like if any event happen this is the waiting period before I start getting the payment right?
[8 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : That is exactly right, yes.
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So you see you start to get paid from the 31st day or the 91st day, but because it's paid in arrears, the first time is 30 days after that, but you still get paid for it. But that 30 and 90 days is the non payment period moving forward.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Let's stay in line today.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK. And there's also a benefit. Friday. So the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefits for anyone injury or illness.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : So in this case, you can select either six months, a one year, A2 year or A5 year option. So which benefit. Would you like to select for you?
[8 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Six months.
[8 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. OK, So what I'll do there finally is let me calculate all that for you Sophie as an indicative cost. Now as part of the insurance I can let you know as well that included in your policy is a rehabilitation benefit along with a final expenses benefit which pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away.
[9 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK? Now your you may will be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each age.
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : And what I'll do Friday is I'll let you know what the the premiums are not only for now, but the following year as well. OK.
[9 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : That's perfect.
[9 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : And if you need to make, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Now finally, given that you also have an existing policy in place for our life insurance, I know that it's a different type of insurance, right?
[9 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : But mostly out of courtesy to yourself that if you are, if you are replacing an existing policy, we recommend that you do not cancel until your application has been approved and you have reviewed this policy in full as it may not be identical to existing cover.
[9 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : And being wonderful Friday that you should also consider the benefits that may not apply or waiting periods may start again as well. OK. But look, I've got the indicative customs here now Friday. But do you have any questions for me in the meantime?
[9 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[9 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : That's beautiful.
[9 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I don't know. Yeah.
[9 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So pretty straightforward, beautiful. Now Fidie, I'll let you know that the next step is usually to take you through those sort of lifestyle questions. But given that you wanted to look at different pricing and maybe different options for the waiting period and benefit.
[10 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[10 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : We can play around with that now. Then once we work out what you want to select, then we can run you through that that process.
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[10 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : But as a starting point if you will check out the maximum level of cover, so $7378 per month worth of as a monthly benefit amount with a night to day waiting period with a benefit period of six months.
[10 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[10 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So each fortnight indicatively that works out at $18.00, so one $818.56 per fortnight.
[10 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[10 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : And it just states you as well Friday that as an indication if you make no changes to the policy, your premium mix year will be $19.00. So one nine $19.30 per fortnight.
[10 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : You said, you said it perfect. Yeah. OK.
[10 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that's the following year. So based on that their fighting, would you like me to look at, you know, a lower benefit amount or different waiting periods or benefit periods or or do you feel that would be suitable for what you need at this stage? OK. Let me just change that for you 30 days down to 90. So that would make that for you at $36.88 per Fortnite?
[11 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Uh, if we put the waiting period down to 30 days instead of 90, OK, it's double up, I think around double up the price.
[11 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : More or less, yes.
[11 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK. Uh, OK, so if we carry 90, it will be around $18.00 point something cents.
[11 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, $18.56.
[11 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Uh, OK, the OK, OK, so if we keep it in the original, which is the the maximum and the waiting period points today and the purpose for six months and what are the next steps like if I'm interested to continue on, what is the next step of the process?
[11 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So that's for that night today waiting period with the other options mainly the same, yes. So we'll need to check your approval of their file to see if you are eligible for the income protection. So it's those, not the livestock questions that I mentioned to you earlier that we need to take you through, may be quite similar to what you went through for the life insurance, but with income protection, there's a few other questions that's specific to this particular product, OK, which I'll take you through now. And then at the end, if it comes back with a green light, we can explain to yourself, you know, how we can get yourself covered so we can get you out all the documents to review in your own time as an actual policy as well.

[24 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And that is the end of the application decided. So what I'll do is I'll have that submitted for you. That'll come back just within a few months to let us know if you've been approved and to see if there's been any changes to anything as well.
[25 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[25 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, just give us 1 moment. OK, So two things I do need to let you know here Friday. So first, all three things. So first of all, the great news is that your application has been approved and your application is approved with the below term. So first of all, there was no added exclusions as well, which is another good thing. The only change that there was Friday, it's showing that that there was actually a premium adjustment. So I do need to advise that we bring MISM to $25.78 per fortnight. And the reason why that's showing that is what they refer to as your BMI, which is due to your BMI levels that you disclosed during the application, generally speaking, your heart to heart ratio, so to speak. OK.
[25 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK, How much again?
[25 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yes, So yes, so before it was at $18.56 per fortnight and now it's at $24.78 per fortnight.
[25 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : That's how much, OK.
[26 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK. So the options we have here now Friday is you can always leave it at that maximum level of cover. But given that you're, you've chosen that 90 day waiting period with a benefit period of six months, we can't make that any more or less accordingly. But what we can do that must be benefit amount if you're trying to bring it back down to that sort of 18 to $20.00 per month per fortnight night. We can actually look at a lower benefit amount for you if you'd like us to.
[26 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : How much lower to the to $18.00? So it's in the same price Origi original premium?
[26 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, let me have a look here for you. It will just take me about 30 seconds just to play around with the prices fighting.
[26 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[26 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So let me just bring it up for you just one moment, OK? I'm just going to look at 6000 first just to see what that comes to. OK.
[27 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Sorry.
[27 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : With all the, I'm just going to look at the $6000 monthly benefit amount for you just to see what that would come to because I've just got to re resubmit it and then it'll bring up the updated pricing based on that amount there and I can let you know as well there finally. But if there is any changes to your BMI moving forward, so you can always have that reassessed moving forward anyway. OK, Now if you were to bring it down to $6000, umm, it doesn't bring it down to the $18.56, but it's $20.96 per fortnight for you based on that $6000 monthly benefit amount.
[27 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[27 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : And like I said, if you're happy to leave it at the 25 odd dollars, umm for that maximum amount, you can do that as well. Just you can let us know. Yes.
[27 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Just as a quick question, this is as an application or this is a quotation for the price you're giving it to me, just to clarify.
[27 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So this is so this is actually given that you've been approved already.
[28 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[28 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So this is actually based on the outcome of the application, which means now that you've been approved and it's got that change, I can then play around with those options and this will be the actual pricing for you.
[28 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. OK. Uh, can, can we hold it off for now? I need to, uh, obviously I need to see if there's any other, uh, provider can give it to me listed because it's jumped from 18 to 24. It's too much. It's, it's, it's jumping a big number now. And this is the fourth month, right? So we took him around $50.00 per month, right?
[28 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Hmm, more or less that's correct.
[28 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[28 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So that's the exact fortnight you're right there Friday and whilst you're looking around there, I can let you know umm, because concerning appreciate Friday, you know, if you're trying to work within a certain budget there at this stage, OK, Look, whilst you're looking around, given that you've gone through that process and that you are approved with us Friday, I can let you know that though we're happy for you to look around and get other prices to see if there's anything more suitable.
[29 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[29 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : You know, given that you've got your life insurance with us as well, what we can do for you there. Finally, we have the alternate process in place here where we can actually get yourself covered based on the option that you would like. Whether it's 6000 or that maximum amount, it is up to you.
[29 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[29 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, Well get yourself covered for your Peace of Mind. What we'll then do is get all the documents out for you to review.
[29 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[29 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK. And then if you feel there finally, I can let you know that if you start off from the highest level of cover and later on in in time, you can actually give us a call and apply to reduce that level of cover if you need to because it's it's less risk, so to speak. So you can actually apply to reduce the level of cover if you need to, but you can't start off on 6000, apply to increase it in that case, if that makes sense. OK. And then by doing that they're fighting if as long as you're comfortable with that process, what we can do is get you that all the documents to review as well, OK. And then if it's not suitable, there's no lock in contracts with that income protection here anyway, Alright. So it gives you the chance to read through everything just if you need to make those changes, we'll let you know what you're eligible for and then we can we can help you through that process moving forward. But to be able to do that, yeah, we just want to confirm if you do want to leave it at that maximum level of cover or if you did want to reduce it down to maybe 6000 or thereabouts.
[30 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Hmm, OK. Hmm. But if I started now, I'll start paying the premium, right.
[30 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Not necessarily, no, because you can actually choose a payment date that's suitable for you up to 30 days away anyway. Of course, yeah, because there's no luck in contracts.
[30 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : So if we go ahead now and if I find something more because I can call and cancel everything, OK. And if I like if if it's done before I do the premium, it doesn't require for me to pay the premium, right?
[30 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : And you, that's correct. Yes, if you do, if you apply to cancel before that premium is taken out, then of course, yeah, because nothing's been taken out.
[31 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : So we have a calling, we we have a calling of. Right?
[31 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : You do 30 days as well.
[31 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK. If this is the case, OK, we can keep everything that, that, that as the previous assessment not changing in the cover or anything. We can keep it and we have the calling of pre.
[31 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Of course, so that's an option that's there for yourself as well. So if you do want to utilize that Friday, you just give us a call, apply to cancel that and any premiums that you've paid in that time gets refunded back to you in full anyway, as long as the claim hasn't been made.
[31 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : MMM, yeah, that's fine. Yeah. So yeah, if we can have this one in place and yeah, we have the putting off. But I need to have the premium to be start to after the 30 days. Is it possible?
[31 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yep, yes.
[31 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[31 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So I'll let you know what day we can choose for you in reference to that, which is the furthest date possible for you.
