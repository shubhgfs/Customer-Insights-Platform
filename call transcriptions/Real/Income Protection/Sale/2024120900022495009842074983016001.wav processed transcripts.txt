So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured of it. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in a free. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So which waiting period would you like me to select? Either 30 or 90 days?
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, 5:30.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, thank you. So I'll do 30 days and the benefit. This is the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefits for anyone injury or illness. Now you have an option as six months, one year, two years or five years. So that's four options there. Which benefit. Would you like me to select? OK, thank you. So we'll go one year.
