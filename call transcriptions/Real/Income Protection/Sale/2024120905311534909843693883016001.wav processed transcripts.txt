It just states here, umm, I need to ask you some questions regarding your duties at work. So it's easier. Before answering any of our questions, it is important that you're aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.

[5 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So, yeah, that's OK. So I'll leave that as a yes for you then. OK.

[7 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : You're self-employed. Mm Hmm.
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for that. And uh, to help determine, uh, how much cover we can offer you, I'll provide you now with the definition of pre tax income. So being self-employed, pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts, less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. This is the amount of the business would otherwise cease earning in the event you're unable to work due to a disability. So can I ask you, what is your annual pre tax income? How much do you make per year before tax?
[8 minutes][Customer] : I just started this one, so I don't know yet, but my previous or when I was working, it's 205. I just put the 190 just to be sure.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : And OK, so you happen to leave it as 205,000 per year, 109, OK, so $190,000 as your annual income before tax. So that's based off ho how how long have you been doing your current occupation for as a Boilermaker? You said 20 years right? And you've just started as a under an ABN.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, yes, yes.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So how long have you been doing under ABN for?
[8 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : It started today, Monday.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, OK. Umm, give me one. Let me just double check this one for you. Would you mind if I pop you in a quick hold?
[8 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No worries.
[8 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll just double check one second. Alright, thank you so much for holding the list, Sir. Yeah, so we can based it on the last 12 months of what you've been earning as a boiler makeup. So what would uh, what were you earning in the last 12 months, Sir?
[9 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, sorry. Come again.
[9 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : What were you, what is your annual income before tax based of your last 12 months of your annual pre tax income? So what is your earning in the last 12 months? Yeah, yeah. Annual income before tax. Yeah.
[9 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : My annual Yeah, before tax. Yeah, it's 205 last year.
[10 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : 205,000. Yeah. Yeah. Perfect. Thank you. That's fine then. So based off your duties less that and your income, you can select the monthly benefit amount from $1000 up to a maximum of $11,958. OK, so the amount that you choose here is the amount that we would pay you per month if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. So to help support, you know your family, cover the mortgage, cover all your necessary things per month. How much do you need on your income protection 10,000? Yeah, you can do that, not a problem. Now the next one is the waiting period and the benefit. On your policy. Now you have to choose this one as well. So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. So if you got 90 days, your first payment would be 120 days after your first eligible to claim. 90 days is a cheaper option, but which, which waiting period would you like to select? 30 days or 90 days? Good. Now the next one Sir, is the benefit. That you can choose. The benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. You can choose six months, one year, two years or five years, six months being the cheapest one. Which one would you like to select there? Sure.
[10 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : I can get 10 grand a month, 30 if it's six months. How? How much per month on that one?
[11 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So I'll have to select that first and then go to the questions and then at at the end of the next questions, I can tell you the final terms and price, OK. And then you can come back and change the monthly, the benefit amount or so the the one year. So I'll leave it at that. If you wanna change that, you can still change it after the application is done, OK? Now any, any of the 10,000 you've chosen 30 days in one year, the one you've chosen, you can still adjust that. I'll just leave it at that for now. OK, now go to the questions. Uh, just gonna read out a quick statement and update your address.
