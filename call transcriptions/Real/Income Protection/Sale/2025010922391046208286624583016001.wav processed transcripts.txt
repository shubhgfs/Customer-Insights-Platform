[22 seconds][Customer] : It's hooked up with my superannuation and all that and I was just saying if I could separate it or what was easier or what was cheaper or if anything at all. So that being 60, it's a bit difficult now, so.
[31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, I can show you how it works. You can apply with this one up until the age of 60.
[39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[38 seconds][Agent] : So when you're 61, you wouldn't be able to apply at that time, but once it is in place, you can keep it until the policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. OK.

[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : It's fine. Yes.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that in that case with this policy here, look, if you are replacing an existing policy, first of all, we do recommend you don't cancel it until your application has been approved and you have reviewed this policy in full as it may not be identical to your existing cover.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : No, no. Yep.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : And you should also consider that the benefits that apply for that one may not apply for this and the waiting period may start again depending on what it is.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So anyway, we'll have a look and see what you can choose from with this one. So your current occupation, are you currently employed or self-employed?
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Employed.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And can I please confirm you're a male Australian resident?
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Correct.
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Now before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Failure to do so could impact your coverage claims time. So the first question, so do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yes, correct. Yes.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yes or no, Thank you. Is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature? Will you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment?
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yes.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yes or no, Thank you. Are you required to perform any physical duties, Yes or no? Do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces, or do you carry a firearm or handle explosives? Yes or no, thank you. That's the duty based assistant complete. So thank you for your patience while going through that. So I'm just going to hop into the next part now. OK. And for your smoking status, sorry, just a reminder, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Now with your annual income before tax, what would that be at the moment? Thank you. And just to confirm, this is for employed not self-employed, is that correct?
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : 160,000 Yes, it is.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Correct. Correct. Yep.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So for the pre tax income, the definition we have would be it's the total annual remuneration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses excluding super contributions.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yes. Yep.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, so 160.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Alright, so that means that based on your duties and your income, benefit $160,000 for the annual income. The monthly benefit amount you can choose would be between 1000 up to $9333 based on your income and dues. What benefit amount would you like me to quote you on? Yep. OK, uh, the next thing we look at is the waiting period. So you can choose 30 days or 90 days, but just keep in mind the income benefits paid monthly and a RE. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. And the waiting period basically is a non payment period. This this is what you must wait before the income benefits payable. So, uh, you can choose 30 or 90. Which would you like me to choose?
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep, 5000 OK 30.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And then the benefit periods, the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. You can choose six months, one year or two years. Which would you like me to choose? OK, let's have a look. So if you look here at a $5000 monthly benefit amount with a 30 day waiting period and a one year benefit. Do you currently pay fortnightly, monthly or annually?
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : One year it's paid annually out of my superannuation.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Somehow they do it. Magical trick.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : I'll SH Yeah, no worries. I'll show you what it is annually, just keeping in mind this one's outside the Super. So the premiums for income protection insurance are generally tax deductible.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK. So the 5000 monthly benefit amount, this is 30 day waiting period and one year benefit.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK, that sounds good.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Annually would be 3451 dollars, OK, and three cents. I should have umm, so that's, if you're looking at the 5000 months of dental. Now that's a 30 day waiting period, a one year benefit.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Yes. OK, that's a big difference in that.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Umm, if you want to reduce that further, just hypothetically a 90 day waiting period, we'll drop that price down to $1916.31 annually, OK. The waiting period does have an impact.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Umm, yeah, If you wanted to even like up the monthly benefit amount, let's say to, uh, I don't know, 8000, let's just say for this example, and you had a waiting period of 90 days and a benefit period of six months, it would be $2427.53.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : And that's with an extra 3000 monthly benefit amount. So I mean, that's just again, an example to show the differences. But if you want to keep it, you know, below 2000 a year and you want that waiting period to be at least a year, then keeping it at 5000 with the 90 day waiting period.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, two, but yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : And the one year benefit. As I mentioned, is under 2000 a year at one, $1916.31 annually. But if that waiting period, of course is something you're prioritizing, then that's fine. It just means that the premium is 3451 and three cents annually.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's a big difference. Some of the words look at. Yeah, definitely.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Alright, we'll go do the three month waiting list. Whatever.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Which one would you like to check your eligibility for the 90 day waiting period?
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : 90 day. Yeah, yeah. Yep.
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, no worries.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : 90 days and yes.
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So we'll go over the helpful master questions now, uh, and then if you're approved, so hopefully, uh, you get the outcome you're looking for.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Yep.
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : As I mentioned, this is an indicative quote, so it is subject to change, but then those questions, once you go through that, then you can at least know what the final result is.
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Uh, now we do also include a rehabilitation benefit with this policy, umm, also along with the final expenses benefit. So the rehabilitation benefit is designed to help get you back to work so you can be making that regular income again, of course. Umm, And this pays a reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit to a maximum of $3000 to help with rehabilitation costs whilst claiming. Or we can reimburse up to six times your income benefit towards cost of equipment or modifications required to assist your return to work.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Umm we also have a final expenses benefit which pays $10,000 in the eventual to pass away on the policy.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh. Yep, Yep, Yep. There you go.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So basically like a funeral cover, OK, Now when it comes down to the 5000 months benefit amount within 90 day waiting period, the one year benefit.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : As I said, that's $1916.31 annually for the indicative quote, which means we give you a refund of $191.63 paid back to you following your first policy anniversary date as we refund 10% of the premiums at that time.
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm. Yep. Ah, yes.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yep. So you know. Hmm. Mm.
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : And then, yeah, you, you're probably aware now that with the income protection insurance, the premiums for this are generally tax deductible, which can make it even more custom effective for you.
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : I obviously can't speak on behalf of your super, but I can't speak on the half of ours. OK. And what's your post code for your home address?
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's fair enough.

[22 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, so today's the 10th of Jan Uh, what date would be suitable for you now?

[22 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that sounds fine.

So again, uh, this monthly benefit amount of 5000 is designed to provide, uh, the financial protection surrounding bills, living costs, etcetera. If you're unable to work due to a disabling signature injury and you suffer a loss of income, It also includes that rehabilitation benefit I defined for you earlier and also that final expenses benefit to help cover, uh, the $10,000 of course gets paid to help cover those funeral costs in the event you pass away under the policy. Umm, which of course touch wood doesn't happen, but yeah, just want to let you know what's included. Umm, now you'll receive your hardwood policy documentation that'll be sent to your postal address, 112 Poundies Rd. Tywin, Lower Victoria 3956. Uh, that'll be set within 5 working days for you. Now what we do is we pop down a method that you would like the payment to come out. If you don't decide to cancel it between now and when the first payment comes out, umm, then we redo a declaration. OK. The declaration takes probably about two minutes to read. Umm, if you're happy with that, then we accept it and then your policy will begin immediately over the phone. And, uh, you'll have received a welcome e-mail shortly after the call.

Now with card, we don't, uh, ask for the number on the back, so just keep that to yourself. And we also don't collect the details until we pause our call recording.

[26 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, so it reads. Thank you. Neil Cooper, it is important you understand the following information. I will ask for your agreement to these terms at the end and your policy will not be enforced unless you agree to these terms in full. Real income protection is issued by Hanover Library of Australasia Ltd and we will refer to as Hanover. Hanover has an arrangement with Greenstone Financial Services, whom I'll refer to as GFS Trading as Real Insurance, to issue and arrange this insurance on it's behalf. Hanover relies upon the information you have provided when assessing your application. That includes the information we initially collected from you to provide a quote. Hanover has set a target market determination for this product, which describes the type of consumers this product is designed for. Our distribution practices are consistent with this determination and you can obtain a copy on our website. I need to remind you of the duty to take reasonable care that you agreed to. Can you please confirm you have answered all that questions in accordance with your duty, Yes or no?
[27 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[27 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. We make some time to time provide offers to you by the communication methods you have provided to us in relation to other products and services. By agreeing to this declaration, you consent to allow us to contact you for this purpose until you opt out. You can opt out of this at any time by contacting us. The accepted cover provides the following insurance cover for Neil Cooper, a monthly insured amount of $5000 with a waiting period of 90 days and a benefit period of 12 months. The monthly income benefit payable in the event of a claim may be less than the monthly insured amount as your income benefit is limited to 70% of the average monthly income over any 12 consecutive months during the two years before you suffered your disabling sickness or injury. Your income benefit can also be reduced if you receive other disability payments from other sources. There is a final expenses benefit of $10,000 paid to your beneficiary is if you pass away while your policy is in place. Your cover expires on February 9th, 2030, 12:00 AM. Your premium for your first year of cover is $1916.31 per year. Your premium is a step premium, which means it will be calculated at each policy anniversary and will generally increase each year. Included in your premium is an amount payable by hand over to GFS of between 37% and 51% to cover costs. Your premium will be debited from your credit card, which you are authorized to debit from and have provided to us. The policy documentation, PDS and FSG will be mailed to you and if you have provided us with an e-mail address, the policy documentation will also be emailed to you today. You should carefully consider these documents to ensure the product meets your needs. You have a 30 day cooling off. When you may cancel your policy and any premium you may have paid will be refunded in full unless you have lodged a claim.
[29 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : None.
[29 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : There are risks associated with replacing policies as your new policy may not be identical to your existing cover. We recommend that you do not cancel any existing policy until you have received and reviewed our policy in full. We have a complaints process which you can access at any time by contacting us. Full details are available online and in the documentation we are sending you. Do you understand and agree with the declaration? Yes or no?
