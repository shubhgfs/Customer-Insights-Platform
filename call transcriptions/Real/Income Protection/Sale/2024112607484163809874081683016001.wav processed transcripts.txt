[30 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Do they have to require dialysis with I think every, every case is different there with with kidney diseases, yes, yeah.
[31 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : But but she had not died live since my tablet just umm, but she just had to wash herself. Yeah. I think it was sad and normal kidney function, not the other one because she was come mum was she was, she was like she was watching her way. She was eating healthy. Yeah. So basically, yeah.
[31 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, well was it what I can do 'cause I've got abnormal kidney function as well 'cause then OK, well.
[31 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : I'm her old age. When she passed away she was 90, so yeah.
[31 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, John, I'll write up the definition of abnormal kidney function, which is pretty much what you're referred as, like kidney disease. So abnormal kidney function or could also be referred to as impaired kidney function is when your kidneys not working as well as they should. If impaired kidney function is not treated or gets worse, it may lead to long term kidney disease or kidney failure. Does that apply to your mum's condition?
[31 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, exactly. Right.
[32 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : That sounds more. That sounds more. But yeah, yeah.
[32 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. It's always.
[32 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, doll.
[32 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : No, that's all right. No worries at all. It's almost John's confident. And I appreciate you coming in there, Angie, into the conversation as well. It's just with the health and lifestyle questions, it's very important that John answers them confidently. We just, we're not it. It applies to every customer, unfortunately.
[32 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : No, I understandable.
[32 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : We just can't have other people.
[32 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Understandable.
[32 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, answering, OK, but no worries at all. Now the next question that we ask you there, John, is to the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family suffered from cancer, heart condition, stroke or other hereditary disease prior to 60? Prior so meaning prior meaning before the age of 60, was that a no?
[32 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep, no.
[32 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Just to confirm That's good. I've got one more question. This one's a very easy one for you to answer. It's hazardous to fuse. So other than one off events you engage in or intense engage in any of the following. So aviation other than as a fair paying passenger on a recognized airline, motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, AB sailing, scuba diving deeper than 40 meters, cable wreck diving or any other hazardous activity.
[33 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no way I can do that.
[33 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Not for you.
[33 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : It's it's it's not him. Yeah, it's things get to do.
[33 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : No, no, fair enough. Not a problem that that's why I said it's a very, fairly easy one to answer. So look, I just want to firstly congratulate you John. You're doing very well and nice and healthy. Your application is approved with low term due to the how we answer the question of BMI. There was a loading as well. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to go through some pricing in regards to what we've gone through over the phone today. I just want to see whether the premium is affordable or if we need to make any amendments to your income protection. So if we look at a monthly benefit of $2000, a waiting period 30 days and a benefit period of five years, your fortnightly repayments, it's $261.31, thirty four cents a fortnight. Is that affordable for the both of you, $261.34 a fortnight? Or do you want me to look at making some, umm, alternatives and looking at some other options there?
[34 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : He might all be more optional.
[34 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, definitely, of course. And if you both have a budget each fortnight that you're looking to spend, I can have a look just to see what I can do. Do you, do you both have a budget in mind that you're able to afford each fortnight? That that'll just make me make it easier in terms of playing around with the figures as well, So I can make that expectation for the both of you. Or what are you, what are you both able to afford each fortnight?
[34 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Please just see what you what you can do. Yeah. And then we'll work it out.
[34 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : What I can do, what I'm going to do, I'm going to drop the benefit period from five years just to one year, just to see how that goes as well, because you'll find that it it does make quite a big difference. It's a jump. It goes to $142.18 a fortnight.
[35 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK.
[35 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : That's for one year.
[35 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[35 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Do you want me to keep making arrangements and see what I can get cheaper?
[35 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : So what's your name for that here? What does that work? It has that work.
[35 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So what that means is if let's say John was off work, that's how long we're we're going to cover him for his salary. If he if he's off work, we're going to cover him for one whole year. Yeah. So that's what it means.
[35 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[35 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So it's the maximum amount of time that we would pay the income benefit for anyone, injury or illness is what what that benefit. Means.
[35 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : And what happened?
[35 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[35 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Touchword, touchword, everything say if you can't work anymore, right. So how does that work then?
[35 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that so that what would have to to he just has to sit more like for example, this one here it's it's going to cover him for one year. So then he just has I'll see if there's anything in our product disposure statement.
[36 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[36 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : If someone is permanently unable to work, give me one moment because that's, I know that's the maximum amount of time that we umm, umm, because just remember this policy, it's going to cover him up until the the policy anniversary following his 66th birthday as well. So yeah, so, umm, permanently unable to work. Let's have a look. That's true.
[36 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : 6050 Can you tell your phone number please?
[36 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : That's what the income protection, not Life, OK, permanently enable work because they just have to seek unable because it's hard. You don't know obviously what the condition is that's going to cause him to be off work as well.
[37 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[37 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, here may be different to your chosen so unable to. So of course, hopefully he'd be able to apply Al also, you know, you just have to check the terms and conditions just to see if he's able to apply for a disability support pension as well because he if he's off work due to a disability because the the income protection if we're choosing one year, that's the amount of time that will we will cover him to that condition. I'm just going to see if there's anything ongoing as well. I'm going benefit payments. Every month that you continue to be unable to work, you and your medical practitioner will need to complete and send us claims form and any other requested documents we we need so that we can assess that you are still entitled to receive the income benefit payments. But that doesn't answer my question or what happens after one year ago. You're responsible for me. No yeah. Because this one, because it's not like a umm, like a total and permanent disabilities, because this is because we encourage people to go back to work. That's what what we encourage for people, of course, but I'm just saying if there's anything in the PDF but umm yeah.
[38 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : It doesn't look like it's it's, that's pretty much what will happen is if it's.
[38 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm talking about, I'm talking about for example, right. For example, you say touchword, Alright, touchword, they can't work anymore because of the an illness, right? Touchword, that's what I'm saying.
[38 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand that because that's that's where it ties with the benefit.
[39 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : No.
[39 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So if he's wanting to be covered for longer than would look at because we won't be able to cover him for the whole time if he's permanently unable to work, right, Because you've got got that expiry, but that's where that ties in with the benefit. So if you're wanting to make sure that you know, if he's permanently unable to work, for example, then you would choose a longer benefit. Rather than one year. But then obviously the, the premiums will, will go up. So if you want to look at that, then what I can do is I can even increase the waiting period from 30 days to 90 days because that will also decrease the payment. So do you want to, let's say we can look at a longer waiting period of 90 days and maybe a benefit period of five years. So meaning that if, if he's, let's say off work, then that means like if he's permanently unable to work, that means we're gonna cover him for five years. Yeah.
[39 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : I didn't say to get if the waiting room period is free for 90 days, then you just you'll get Backpage.
[40 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So that what what happens is it's not so much he gets back paid because what the waiting period is I'll explain what a waiting period is as well as well. So the waiting period is the non payment period that he must wait before the income benefit is payable after being short of then.
[40 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[40 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So that's why we give you the choice where you can choose a 30 day or 90 day waiting period. Please keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in a risk. This means if he chooses a 30 day waiting period, the first payment would be six days after if he was first eligible to claim. So if you choose a 90 day waiting period, his first payment would be 120 days.
[40 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no.
[40 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So it's not so much that he gets back paid, that's when he starts getting paid by the insurance from us.
[40 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK. Can you work out then the free mums and then the free mums, Right. And then, John, are you happy with the free mums waiting period and the five year thing?
[41 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[41 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, try that. Yeah.
[41 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So the premiums on that cover there, it's $178.73 a fortnight. So that's with the waiting period of 90 days and a benefit period of five years. Yeah. How's that for for the both of you? Is that affordable or do you want me to? Because of course I want to find something that's going to meet your needs too. But H, how's that is that? Do you feel that would be affordable for the both of you or do you want me to look at two years and see how we go?
[41 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : It's a pay, it's a payment. How do the payments work? Like for nightly?
[41 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, You can do a fortnightly, monthly or annually.
[41 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Can you do?
[41 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : And just remember as well that you know what John pays to us, we can generally claim it back on his tax as well.
[41 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Can you, can you, can you do? Can you chapter? Can we pay? Can we pay weekly?
[42 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : We can do it monthly. That's the other alternative. From fortnightly. We don't have the options to do weekly, so it's pretty much fortnightly, monthly or annually.
[42 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Well, if we do a weekly, it's for more, It's better, affordable. It's like we like every week. We know that.
[42 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : I wish I could accommodate for that. We we don't have the even the option to do weekly at all. This would have to No, we don't. It's just if someone makes MI misses a payment, it's just too hard for our payments team to catch up on people that do it weekly. So that's why the options are fortnightly or monthly. So that's where we can accommodate.
[42 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I do.
[42 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Umm, there for you.
[42 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Maybe fortnightly then. Yeah, fortnightly.
[42 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, and John is $178.73 a fortnight. Is that doable for you?
[42 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine.
[42 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Is that OK, John?
[42 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I pay a little bill.

Full details are available online and in the documentation we are sending you two final questions there for you John, and we're all done. So the first question that we ask you is, do you understand and agree with the declaration of just you, yes or no? Very good. The last question asked, would you like any other information about the insurance now or would you like me to read any part of the product disclosure statement to you today over the phone?
[56 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yes, no.
[57 minutes][Agent] : All right, no worries at all.
[57 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Hi, I've got a section. Do you know all the do you know the documents? It says it's been emailed to us. Can you can you send them by post please?
[57 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yes, Yes, Angie, of course, yes, yeah, that's what we do as well. So not only do we e-mail umm that we e-mail a confirmation, but we we work O old school as well whe where we post out all the policy documents. Now, John, if you also want to take advantage of that final expenses benefit of $10,000 to help cover funeral costs, there's going to be a beneficiaries form that we Li we get you to fill out, you sign it and then send that back through to us as well if you're wanting to take advantage of it too.
[57 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : So what is, how does that work?
[57 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So it's a final expenses benefit. So if let's say John, hopefully this doesn't happen, but if John were to pass away during the period of insurance, they there's $10,000 that the family can claim on so that that there could be assisted with funeral costs.
[57 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I need it's no extras. OK, OK.
[58 minutes][Agent] : So if he wants, no, no, it's automatically included in the premiums that he pays or that you both pay because you're paying from a joint account.
[58 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, cancel.
[58 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : But yeah, it's automatically included, which there's no extra cost on it. Umm, there. So I'll just reconfirm, make sure I've got the details correct. So we've got Mr. John Sands, date of birth the 7th of April 1965 in your mail as well as an Australian residence. Yeah, Angie, I'll confirm your details because what I've done is I've put down as a third party and pay. So basically what that means is you you've got full access as the policy where you can inquire, make changes, cancel the policy if required. So I've got you down as Angie St. date of birth the 10th of January 1967. Thank you. And then H home and postal address we've got is 1A Egret Court Werribee Victoria 3030. John, I'll reconfirm your mobile is 0412541104. Alright, perfect. So I think that's pretty much all covered there, there.
[58 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[59 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Can I just ask you a question as well, John, because I know that Angie deals with the finances. Do you still handle your own finances? Do you still make your own financial decisions? Like are you able to do that? Yeah, I know we do. You. Are you still able to physically make your own financial decision?
[59 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[59 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : I understand that she she does that she but do do you have a disability that's stopping you from making your own financial decisions or it's just simply that she just looks after it? Yes.
[59 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : All I do is work and I give you the money.
[59 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yes, I thought so. No, no, I know because. Yeah. No, the reason I ask, it's not, not like that at all.
[59 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : I told them yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, it's just that.
[59 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Because, you know, some people, they can't make their own financial decisions because they're physically just not, you know, or cognitively not able to do that as well. Like they've got a disability or, you know, some people, you know, put down power of attorneys to because they can't even do their own finances as well. So that's why I asked that so, but no.
[1 hours 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, but I'm sure I'm how old to you? I'm Pert, how old to you?
[1 hours 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I just said OK, no, that's good. No, I just wanted to make sure. But that that's fine. Angie, I've got you down. Like if you, you know, if you want to call on his behalf, you know, make any changes or enquire about the policy, you've got that full right to do so there. So just we're going to send out a copy to angie.johnnysand@mail.com and then we're going to post out all the policy documents via post.
[1 hours 43 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[1 hours 44 seconds][Agent] : No, that's fine. Anything else that you'd like to add while I've got you both on the line there? But I think I've pretty much covered absolutely everything there.
[1 hours 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. No, that's all.
[1 hours 57 seconds][Agent] : No worries. Alright, beautiful. Well, that's all been done. So look, thank you so much for your time there, for the both of you. And I hope you have a wonderful, lovely evening.
