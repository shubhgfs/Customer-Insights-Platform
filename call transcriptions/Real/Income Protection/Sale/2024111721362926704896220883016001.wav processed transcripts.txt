[15 seconds][Customer] : I think I have.
[17 seconds][Agent] : Excuse me.
[16 seconds][Customer] : A long time ago, but I stopped.
[19 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. So what I can do is grab a couple of quick details from you and then we can go through how it all works and look at some pricing together. What was your surname please, Stacey?

[31 seconds][Customer] : I'll spell it BUDZ IARSKI, second of the 6th, 84.
[41 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. And lastly, just confirming that you are a female and an Australian resident. All right, thank you very much. And umm, Stacy, in regards to, uh, income protection, obviously designed to cover your income, what do you do for work at the moment? OK, no worries. And is this full time, part time casual?
[47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm in massage therapist full time.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK yeah. Cool. How long you been doing that?
[1 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : I work for myself about a year.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. Prior to working for yourself, were you employed as a massage therapist still or? OK Yeah, cool. And what has made you decide now is the right time to look at income protection? Sure, understandable.
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, I just, I feel a bit vulnerable if if something ever went wrong or if I was in an accident, maybe I'd have no income.
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I mean, especially when you work for yourself, you don't get sick leave and stuff like that.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, exactly.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so yeah, I can understand. Alright, well, umm, just to give you a quick rundown about how our cover works, umm, it is designed to pay a monthly income benefit directly to you if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. It is designed to cover your essential bills and living costs while your salary is interrupted. And you just need to be able to confirm that you work 15 hours per week in paid employment. And we can definitely go through an application and ask you some questions about your treaties at work alongside your health and lifestyle to check your eligibility. And then from there, umm, once the cover's in place and we can advise you, sorry, before the cover's in place, we can advise you if you're approved and if so, on what terms.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and then once it covers in place, it's designed to cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Just keeping in mind that there are some exclusions that applies outlined in the PDS and the amount we can offer, it can range up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 to a maximum of $15,000. So we'll go through this all together and see how we can help you out there. And we'll go through the duties based questions 1st. And all these questions are just pretty straightforward yeses and noes, but if there's anything you're not sure on, just let me know. I'll be with you every step of the way. OK, awesome. So before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Value to do so could impact your cover claims time. So first question, Stacy, do you work 15 hours or more per week? Perfect. Is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment?
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I do clinical.
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. So.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : I do home massage services for the elderly.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So it's all indoor stuff? Yeah. Cool. Now are you required to perform any physical duties?
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yes, like massage.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So it says here physical duty means the use of in of force in lifting, lowering, pushing, pulling, throwing, carrying or otherwise moving, holding or restraining or operating machinery.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Oh, well, yes, I carry in a massage table.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, sure.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : That's it.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : And do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle? Yep. Cool.
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Can I drive a car to the places?
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : And that's to get to and from clients, right? Yeah. Cool.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's right.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Are you qualified, skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role?
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew, Entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces? Or do you handle explosives? OK, be a very exciting massage therapist for sure.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Uh, do you regularly work underground or underwater? Work at heights above 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul? Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. And as you already informed me that you are self-employed, Uh, our definition here of pre tax income for someone self-employed is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts, less any business expenses, excluding, uh, sorry and excluding super contributions. This is the amount that the business would otherwise cease earning in the event you are unable to work due to a disability. So what is your annual pre tax income please Stacy. OK awesome. So based on your income and your duties we can offer a monthly income benefit to you ranging from $1000 up to a maximum of $5833. Keeping in mind like I said it is designed to cover your essentials. So at this present time in your life Stacy, are you renting or do you have a mortgage?
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : 100K and I'm 19.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. And do you have any dependents?
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Nice.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Do you have any other insurances like health insurance, car insurance? Umm, personal identity?
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : I have health insurance this.
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep. OK umm, do you have any personal loans, credit cards, things that need to be paid if you were unable to work?
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Ahm I have a personal name.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, cool.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : I think there's 10,000 still or less remaining on this.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : And then obviously, you know, we've got your essentials like groceries, utilities and stuff like that. Do you have any other major bills or commitments that would need to be taken care of immediately if you were off work? OK, cool. Well with all that in mind, how much do you think on a monthly basis would you need to cover your essentials? We can go from 1000, we can go 1102 hundred 300 all the way up to 5833 dollars.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No, no idea. This is oh, I have a subscription card as well as these two weeks at 435. Oh, but I I don't know, let's just go for the higher the 5000.
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, 5000.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure thing. Yeah, yeah, for sure. We can definitely adjust that. At the end of the day, it all comes down to what is suitable for you and what's affordable for your situation. All right, so we'll start it at $5000 to see it the go. Rolling on the quote itself. Now there's different waiting periods and benefit periods that we can use for you to cater to what's suitable for your situation.
[7 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : I can always have that adjusted current if I come the time that up, yeah.
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Now the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Those are the two options we have, but just keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly and arrears, which means that if you do choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. The 90 days is the longer the two options and generally the cheaper of the two options as well, but doesn't mean you have to wait longer to get a payment. Which waiting period would you like me to look out for you first?
[8 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Nine days.
[8 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. Now the benefit. Is the maximum length of time that we will payout a claim for each individual injury or illness that you claim on. So we have four options. You've got, uh, six months, one year, two years or five years. Now, the shorter the benefit. The cheaper the options, but obviously the less length of time we can payout a claim. If you do need to claim on it, which one would you like me to show you first?
[9 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : One year.
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, cool. Now with these.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Are you supposed to know? Bye. Please.
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that's it. You, you don't know. Umm, the idea is we look at the parameters of the cover, go through the health question and see if we can approve you and assess so on what terms.
[9 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Then we'll look at what the price is based on that and then we can adjust it as need be.
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, All right, so with that all, umm, uh, there, umm, we'll load up these health questions to check the terms of cover. Umm, I just need to read a quick statement out to you called a pre underwriting disclosure. It's just a helpful, uh, reminder of your duty to take reasonable care when answering the questions. Uh, and again, like with the Judy's base questions, uh, simple yeses and no's and if there's anything you're unsure of, then uh, yeah, just let me know. I'll be with you every step of the way.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[10 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So it says yeah, uh, again. Please be aware that all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes. We collect your personal information to provide insurance quotes, issue cover and other related services. We will share this with your insurer and they share it with other Australian service providers for the purpose of administering your policy or handling claims.

So it's about $17.43 a week. Umm, and then the premiums for this one as well, Spacey, they're actually tax deductible, so it can make it a bit more cost effective for you come tax time. Do you do your own taxes or do you have someone do that for you?

[22 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : No, that's all. That's all. Good. That's good.

You can give us a call. If you wanna make more drastic changes, you can do so. It's subject to eligibility, Umm, and you can also find information about our premium structure on our website.

Included in your premium is that amount payable by Hanover to GFS of between 37% and 51% to cover costs. Your premium will be debited from your nominated bank account in the name of Stacy Pojski, which you authorized the debit from and have provided to us. The policy documentation, PDS and FST will be mailed to you and if you've provided us with an e-mail address, your policy documentation will also be emailed to you today. You should carefully consider these documents to ensure the product it's your needs. You have a 30 day cooling off. When you may cancel your policy and any premium you may have paid will be refunded in full unless you've launched a claim. There are risks associated with replacing policies as your new policy may not be identical to existing cover. We recommend that you do not cancel any existing policy until you have received and reviewed our policy in full. Finally, we have a complaints process which you can access at any time by contacting us. Full details are available online and in the documentation we are sending you. So may I please confirm do you understand and agree with the declaration, yes or no?
