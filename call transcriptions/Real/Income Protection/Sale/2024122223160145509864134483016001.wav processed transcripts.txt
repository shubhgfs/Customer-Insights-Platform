[5 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, beautiful. So we'll look at that 7291 now. You do also have the option to select different waiting periods and benefit periods depending on your circumstances. So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days, but keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So would you like to look at the 30 or the 90 days?

[6 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Can we also get into that sort of comparison later on or not really?
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Of course we can. Yeah, we can look at both, but you wanna keep it at the 90 days just.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, start over 90 AM.
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Perfect. Now you there's also the benefit. So that's the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefits for anyone injury or illness. But if you can choose either six months, one year, two years or five years.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : For five years please.

[18 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Just letting this one up now. Bear with me and congratulations there. Margaret. Your application is approved with the below term. So there has been a a premium adjustment due to BMI. So in relationship, the height and weight you gave us. Now the good news is that you've been fully approved for the cover, which is fantastic. So we'll take you through some options for pricing and some different quotes. Let me know how they sound and we can go from there.
[18 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[18 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Once obviously we find a level that's suitable, we'll discuss your options and what to do from there. Now with this cover FO for a monthly benefit amount of $7291.00 with a 90 day waiting period and a five year benefit.
[19 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[19 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : You'd be looking at a fortnightly premium of $88.72, correct?
[19 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Not bad.
[19 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. Now did that one sound affordable? Did you want to have a look at any other amounts or adjusting any aspect?
[19 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So that's short nightly payments.
[19 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, correct. Yep.
[19 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : You said 88, so monthly would be 100. Yeah.
[19 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : And also, so it's a bit more than double because it's not exactly what you put in every month, but yearly works out the exact same either way, but it works out to be $192.23 for the month.
[19 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Month. OK, alright.
[19 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Now, did you want to have a look at adjusting some aspects on that quote?
[19 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : What was the first one that I asked? The 30 days that would have been more expensive. Hey.
[19 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Right, correct. So if if you were wanting to look at options that like for example, reducing the premium, I'll, I'll take, I'll give you a couple of ways you can do that because there's a number of different aspects that impact pricing. So let me just pull up a second option for you and let me know how that one sounds. Sorry, it's just loading. OK. So for example, if we had a look at the $7000 benefit amount with a 90 day waiting period still, but a two year benefit. That would actually reduce that monthly premium to $116.91 a month.
[20 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK, alright, and that's two years.
[20 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So that's 116 and $0.91 A2 year benefit. $7000 monthly benefit amount and a 90 day waiting period.
[20 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, alright.
[21 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Is that one maybe sent?
[21 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Are you are you able to e-mail me those quotes? How many D?
[21 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course we can.
[21 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : How many days can I call you back and just be able to go ahead do those parts?
[21 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So with the health and lifestyle questions, they're valid for 30 days now with this one here, I'm more than happy to send you through those quotes with some information. We'll discuss through your options at the end. There's a couple more things I do want to let you know with this cover, but I can honestly, like I said, that information for you, that's no issue, but I just want to take you through.
[21 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : MMM MMM MMM.
[21 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So with this cover, included in the policy is a rehabilitation benefit along with the final expenses benefit which pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away to assist with things like the funeral expenses. Also with this policy you your premium is obviously stepped which means it will generally increase each year as you age. As an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $125.03 per month. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. Have a reward. So following your first policy anniversary day, we'll actually refund you 10% of the premiums you paid in that time. So on this policy here, you'd be looking at getting $140.29 back from us after the first year.
[22 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : OK, after the first year?
[22 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, correct.
[22 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Only after the first year. What about the succeeding years? No.
[22 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Now, No, no, sorry. It's, it's, it's us giving like obviously money back. It's have a reward, but it's only for the first year.
[22 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK, alright.
[22 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Now, one of the great things about us here at Real Insurance is that we can actually organise to get you covered over the phone today now that you've been approved. What that would actually mean though, and Margaret, is that we get your proper policy documentation sent out. That way you can sit down, take the time to have a good read through to make sure obviously happy with everything to do with the cover. You get the piece of mind you're covered while you're doing that, but you don't actually have to pay anything until the day you choose. If you end up looking through it all and you change your mind for any reason, that's perfectly fine. There's no cancellation fees, you're not locked into this and you do have a 30 day cooling off.
[23 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : That's great.
[23 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So if you cancel within that is you get a full refund of any premiums you may have paid. Unless of course the claim has been made, but obviously that's not the case for a very, very long time, if at all. Now, I'll just confirm a couple more of your details. So in our system, we've got an e-mail address here. How do you pronounce your surname again? Sorry.
[23 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's Sakai.
