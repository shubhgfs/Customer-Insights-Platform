So basically, firstly, our cover is designed to provide a monthly income benefit that's paid directly to you, Steven, if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. It's designed basically to help cover your bills and living costs if your salary is interrupted.

Now, once it covers in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Keep in mind that there are some exclusions that applies outlined in the PDF as well. And also keep in mind that the premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible, which can make it even more cost effective for you as well. So when the time comes to prepare tax returns even. And then the financial statement will automatically be posted out to you in July of the new financial year to provide you a tax representative as well. So you can use that.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. So no.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, any questions while I've explained this so far, firstly, OK, let's go to the first lot of questions. And firstly, it's easy. Before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your covered claims time. Just a yes or no here. First question, do you work 15 hours or more per week? Yeah.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I spend most of my time indoors. I I do. I work on a truck two days a week. So the majority is indoors. Yeah.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Next one, is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment indoors? Thank you. So I'll leave that as yes. Next one, are you perform? Sorry, are you required to perform any physical duties?
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Well, yeah, on a Monday and Tuesday, yeah. So yeah.
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah and it says do you perform heavy physical duties, is heavy machinery or drive a vehicle?
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Uh, drive a vehicle?
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yes, I live as a yes. And it says are you qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role?
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : And do you work in any of the following fields, aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces? Or do you handle explosives? And do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights above 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul? Thank you. And have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : And are you currently employed or self-employed, Sir?
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : I am self-employed.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Thank you.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : I suppose that's what it is. Yeah.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, thank you. And to now help determine how much cover we can offer you, Steven provide you with the DEF definition of pre tax income. So being self-employed, pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before taxed directly due to your own personal efforts less than in business expenses and excluding super contributions. This is the amount that the business would otherwise see sending in the event you are unable to work due to a disability. So can I ask you what is your annual pre tax income? How much do you make per year before taxed?
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Uh, per year before tax I make one. Just let me get hang on a SEC.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, take it off 90,000. Thank you. So let's place it off that. So based on your duties and your income there, you can now select a monthly benefit demand from $1000 up to the maximum of $5250. So this is the amount that you choose now is what we would pay you per month in the event you're unable to work due to disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. So when you look at your specific monthly bills, how much do you feel would be an adequate amount that you'd like to select for your income protection?
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : I get it's about 90,000, umm, just the 1000. That's what it would be fine.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure, let's do that. Now.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : It's cheaper obviously for the 1000.
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : The next step is to choose the waiting period and correct. Yeah, that'll be the cheapest option. Yeah.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Other than these, yes, yeah.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, the next one is the waiting period and the benefit. OK, Now the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So keep in mind the 90 day option, obviously it is the cheapest option because you'd have to wait 100, 20 days to receive your first payment. So which one do you want to choose?
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Will go 90 days mate.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : 30 days or 90 days for that 190 days now. Thank you. So the next one is the benefit. OK. The benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. You can choose six months, one year, two years or five years, six months being the cheapest there. Which one would you like to select?
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Six months please mate.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Six months? OK, I'll show you now an indicative quote for you to show you the price on this one. So looking at the monthly benefit amount of $1000, waiting period of 90 days, benefit period of six months per fortnight, it's about $10.90 per fortnight. OK, Uh, it comes with the cash back as well. So you get back $28.33 after the first policy anniversary day, which is our real reward. And included in your policy is a rehabilitation benefit along with the final expenses benefit as well, which pays $10,000 to your beneficiaries in the event that you pass away while you're insured with us as well, God forbid.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK?
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Now your premium is kept with this policy, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. As an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $12.30 a fortnight. OK.

[24 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So I think monthly works out to be 33.79 exactly.
[24 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. No, that's brilliant.
[24 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : All right.
[24 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : And did you say you'd get somebody to ring me tomorrow and we can sort a certificate of currency out?
[24 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Correct, Yeah, once the first payment goes through, it should obviously come out today sometime, but once it goes through, it should take a particular this day and then I'll set a call back for them to call you back tomorrow to help you with that. Or you can call directly back in if you want to get it done. If you're, you know, waiting on the call, you can just call straight back in and apply to receive this currency over the phone as well. So we'll e-mail it to you. But I was going to ask you this last question and then I'll provide you with your policy number as well and my contact number, Steven, and I'll set that call back for you as well myself. Umm, so the last question is, would you like any other information about the insurance now or would you like me to read any part of the PDS to you? Yes or no? OK, beautiful. Give me one tick. Uh, I've set it for you now. Fortnightly, OK, so $15.60 fortnightly.
[25 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep, no, Yep.
[25 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : And that will come out today on the 8th of January 2025.
[25 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : You'll send all this out on e-mail anyway, won't you?
[25 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : And your policy number and contact number are one second, you'll get that in the e-mail, definitely in the e-mail copy and the hard copy. But I'll just give it to you now so you can note it down in the safe spot.
[25 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep, 72200.
[25 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Policy number is 72200, 11251. So that's the policy number, OK. And the contact number is 1300 385 792.
[25 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yep, 1351 OK 1300 385792.
[26 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK. And that's all done for Steve.
