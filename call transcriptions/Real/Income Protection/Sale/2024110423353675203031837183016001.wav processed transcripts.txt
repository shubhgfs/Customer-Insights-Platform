[2 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, absolutely.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Well, what income protection? Therefore, it's designed to provide a monthly income benefit paid directly to you. If you're unable to work, that's due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. That's designed to help cover your bills and living costs if your salary is interrupted and you're not able to work for that time. Yeah.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : What we offer is an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income and that's from $1000 up to a maximum $15,000 per month.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : It's also very easy to apply for. So what what I'm going to do today is simply ask you some health and lifestyle questions to see if you are approved and then if so, what terms. We can also cover a month in place. It will cover you until the policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Now just keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the product disclosure statement. Now what you'll also find with us to what what you pay to us, you can generally claim it on your tax, which can make it even more cost effective for you as well.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Any questions at all regards to the cover so far there Morgan, before I move on?
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, like what? Whatever the monthly premiums.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. I'm going to go through that for you very shortly. So I've just got a few steps that I've got to go through. So I'm just going to have to ask you some questions regards to duties that you do at work. And then I'm also going to choose like how much cover you feel that you'd need as well. And then that will just generate some indicative pricing to start off with. Oh, so just before answering any of that questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your coverage claims time. So firstly, do you work 15 hours or more per week? Of course, certainly. And is your role of administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment?
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I've been missing my phone, not any doors, but in the case.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, so not indoors, it's outdoors, is it?
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Right, right. Yeah, it was 7.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I'll select a note for that one. And do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle? Yeah. OK. Beautiful. And are you qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role?
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Uh, heavy machines in charge of the vehicle, yeah Uh, qualified.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, very good. And do you work in any of the following fields? So aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces? Or do you handle explosives?
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Uh, none of the other?
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Oh, thank you. And do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights above 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul?
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : No.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. OK. Now next question is in relation to smoking. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Thanks for answering honestly. Something like that once it's been past 12 months since you've had a cigarette there. Morgan, you can give us a call back and apply to have that question reviewed too, now, are you? Yeah. So that's not a loading's not there forever. So you can, if you ever have the intent to quit smoking in the future, give us a call and let us know.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, awesome.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : And also with your employment status, are you currently employed or self-employed?
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Improved.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for that. Now just to determine how much cover we can offer you, I'll provide you with the definition of pre tax income. So pre tax income is the total annual remuneration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses, excluding super contributions. So what is your annual income before tax there please?
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : That's UP. No, hold on.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : 152,000 per year.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, 150 2.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, thank you. Now the next thing I'll get you to select for me is the monthly benefit amount. So based on your annual income and your duties that you do at work, you can apply for income protection from a minimum $1000 per month all the way up to $8866 per month. So let's say for example, if you work were off work, how much do you feel that you'd need, oh, to cover your expenses each month, your living costs, your bills each month? 1200 a week. OK, yeah. So I'll times that by four. Sorry. That's 4800 a month. Yeah, that's certainly.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Probably maybe say 1200 a week, say yeah you couldn't much say 55000 a year, 5000 a month I guess.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. I'll look at $5000 per month for you. The next thing I'm going to get you to choose to me is a waiting period and I'll explain what this is for you as well. So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. So you can choose 30 days or 90 days. Now please keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in a raise. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. So do you want to look at a 30 day waiting period or a 90 day waiting period there for yourself?
[7 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, uh, three days.
[8 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Of course, 30 days, of course, no problem. Now the last thing I'll get you to choose a benefit. I'll explain what this is for you as well. The benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So let's say if you were off work, how long would you like us to cover your salary for? So the choices are you have is 6 months, one year, two years or five years. What benefit.
[8 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Maybe 12 months.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Would you like to, umm, to look at, Yep, 12 months. Beautiful. So I'll run through some indicative pricing to start off with. And then what, what I'll do is I'll take you through the health and lifestyle questions over the phone and see whether we can get you approved too. But if you're starting at $5000 for the monthly benefit, the waiting period at 30 days and the benefit.
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm. OK.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : At one year, your fortnightly repayments is $156.05 a fortnight, so you're looking at roughly it's just a bit.
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Oh.
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : It's $78 per week for your income protection cover. How does that appear for you? How's that sound?
[9 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Let me just have a look.
[9 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Sounds all right. Good. OK. Well, that's awesome. Do you want me to play with around with the figures yet?
[9 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Oh, it's me.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Just happy just to leave it, what with what we've gone through so far.
[9 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : It's me. It's me. It is better. Mm, hmm.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Certainly, of course. Well, what I'll do next now is I'm going to take you through your health and myself questions because this is going to tell us the final price in any terms of conditions of coverage determined on that outcome as well.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Now, when you're approved, uh, Morgan, just a couple of things I'll mention to you. I've mentioned that what you pay to us, you can generally claim it on your tax.
