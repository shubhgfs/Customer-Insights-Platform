[4 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So before entering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duties to answer. There we are. Just let me go through that again with you. Yep. So before answering our questions, it's important that you are aware of your duty to answer all of our questions accurately. And also honestly, if I let's do so could impact your cover at claims times. So Joel, do you work 10 hours or more per week, yes or no?
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment, would that be a yes or a no?
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : No, No.

OK Heights above 10 meters, walk offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul. Thank you. All right. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Cigarettes. OK. And are you currently employed or self-employed?
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no self-employed.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah. So we do ask annual income before tax. So under self-employed pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax. So directly due to your own personal efforts less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. So this is the amount that the business would otherwise state earning in the event you were unable to work due to a disability. So what is your annual pre tax income?
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Pre tax just in the bank without anything getting taken out of it.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So before tax.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Is that is that what you mean?
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Before tax. Yeah.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 132,000 if it works out you roughly.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Yeah. So 132 K. So based on your duties and also income, you can select their monthly benefit amount from 1000 and it ranges up to 7700. So the 7/7 per month that works out to be 70% of your month pre tax income. So I guess when deciding on umm, a monthly benefit amount to insure yourself for you can think about what are some of your ongoing expenses and you know, basically how much money you would need to help you, umm, you know, keep like help you help you still, you know, take care of all your bills and everything if your salary would interrupt. So umm, what are some of your ongoing expenses at the moment? Yes.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I got the mortgage for the house. I've got a car loan. Yeah. Not, not, not a whole lot.
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's right.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : I mean, it's it's me and my wife.
[8 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Why? Yep.
[8 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : We split our pays and yeah.
[8 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK yeah. And of course, like, you know, food for yourself, right? Like, yeah. Right. So yeah.
[8 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. So yeah, definitely that as well.
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Well, like, like you're living expenses there, so yeah, definitely need food every day, Right. So yeah. So, uh, how much cover would you like me to quote you on between 1000 to 7700?
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : If I, if I did the 7700, is there a way of telling me how much that will cost for the payments of it?
[8 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, we can start off on that amount 1st and we can always go back and adjust it the results.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'll quote you on the maximum benefit first, which is 7/7 per month. Now there's a waiting period and there's also a benefit. On the policy. So the waiting period, that's the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable, umm, after, uh, the insured event. So once again, uh, the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind that the income benefit, it is paid monthly in arrears. So this means if you choose that 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So which waiting period would you like me to select first for you?
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : I'll go to the $30.00 please.
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah, I'll, I'll show you 90 days as well if you need to afterwards. And the best.
[9 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Is the maximum amount of time that will do pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So that's basically how many months we can pay you about the seven in the claim of yours for that one injury or illness. So you can select six months, you can do one year, two years or five years. So which benefit. Which I'm going to show you first.
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Show me the lower one first, please. Yes, please. Yep.
[10 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Six months, OK, alright. So so far we're looking at $7700 per month with the waiting period of 30 days. I'll bring you on a six month benefit. Your indicative quote, Jo Joel, so far is $57.32 per fortnight every two weeks.
[10 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : OK, Umm, yeah, I think I'm, I'm pretty happy with that, yeah.
[10 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. And let's say if you like, once you come in to cover if your circumstances change again, you do have flexibility with the policy. So you you can apply to reassess it. So let's say if you, you know, a few months or a year or whatever time frame you feel that you want to maybe extend the benefit. You can apply to do so, which is subject to your age eligibility. Otherwise, you can also reduce your monthly benefit amount or we can even extend the waiting period to to 90 page as well if you need to apply to reassess. OK, yeah and yeah, and very easy process to apply. So with our health and lifestyle questions, they're mostly yes or no answers. Umm, you don't have to go through anything else. So once the assessment's completed, I'll provide you with your results if you are accepted, Joel, And if you're happy with that outcome, umm, I can offer you the full cover today. And that's when all your paperwork gets sent out.
[11 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[11 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So you receive a copy through the post at home and you also receive that e-mail copy as well for your records. Yeah.
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : And what's. Yeah. And what's also included is a rehabilitation benefit as long so along with a final expenses benefit, which pays out $10,000 in the event that you pass away. So Touchwood, if you pass away whilst your income protection is in place, you know for example your wife can can request for $10,000 to be paid out to help assist with the funds to use towards your funeral whilst the rest of the claims being processed. So that's also included in the policy. Yep.
