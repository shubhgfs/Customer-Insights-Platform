[50 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. Thank you, Khalil. Alright, not a problem.
[59 seconds][Customer] : That's right.
[53 seconds][Agent] : And so yes to as a reminder, we spoke about, uh, so the income protection cover we're looking at uh, the monthly and short amount of $10,500 thirty days, the waiting period and one year as the benefit. OK, umm, and that was a total monthly premium of $244.23 per month. Umm, first of all, Khalil, can I just quickly confirm that they've been no change to any answers in the, as far as your working duties and as well, umm, the health and lifestyle questions, is that right? No change.
[1 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Hmm. Mm.
[1 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, excellent. And so, yes, the monthly cost is $244.23 per month.
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm. Yep. No. Can you please make it for two, two years?
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : That's what to use the benefit. Sure.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Bear with me one moment then I'm just gonna get a, uh, get the quotation sorted out for you and umm, uh, could I? Just to check as well again. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months mate? Yes or no?
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Not. Not yet. Mm Hmm.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Right, alright. I'm just gonna double check the terms of which we're able to offer you the cover as well. Make sure I've got all that correct information from me.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Alright, brilliant. Now the monthly figure, So working off $10,500 monthly benefits, 30 days waiting period and two years benefit. Uh, that would be a monthly premium of $315.60 per month, OK.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : What what about if I find all ad firm like one time? How much can we be altogether?
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Like a, a, a annual figure.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, great question. It will turn out the same, uh, when you do a monthly figure or umm, a fortnightly monthly or annually for reference of the policy year on an annual basis, it would be $3787.25 on the year. If that's the way you'd prefer to do it on an annual basis, is that gonna be easiest?
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : OK. Is that is that I can save anything from there because most some of the insurance they give a much, much discount like 13 to $300.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : MMM, Yeah, great question. So yeah, to repeat what I mentioned just briefly before, uh, fortnightly monthly or annually, it will learn all turn out the same over the policy year. So there's no, umm, actually you wouldn't miss out if you choose monthly over annually.
[3 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : So, uh, what about if I pay all, if I pay all of all of the months for one time, like at the firm like today or whatever? Mm hmm.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So if you did an annual figure, there'd be no difference in cost between annual and then paying 12 months of on a monthly basis. OK. It all turns out the same over the policy year. We calculate our premiums on a daily rate, OK.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : How much of the pay?
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, on an annual basis it'd be $3787.25. Or if you prefer to break it down to monthly, it's $315.60 per month. That's ten and a half, $1000 monthly benefit, 30 days waiting period, two years benefit. OK. Do you generally prefer a monthly or annual payment?
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Uh, just monthly.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Monthly three years?
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : If it's no different, I'm going to go monthly.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK, here he is. And would you rather we worked off the one year benefit. Like before or there's a two year gonna be more ideal for you?
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Uh, Yep, actually the the T is going to be those bit higher. So is he any other discount or anything? Just bring it down a little bit. I have to get the three years one, but 315 dollars are a lot of money monthly as well.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's perfect. Fine. The the ways we can reduce the cost.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : You know, this, this, this insurance is only for just in case for I work 15 years the same job.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Hmm, that's perhaps, maybe look at a different monthly benefit amount, uh, because we ultimately what income protection insurance is designed for a little, umm, is your benefits, your essentials. So just to keep you afloat, umm, while you recover, umm, from whatever it may be, umm, with your essentials. I mean, uh, what are your like utilities and groceries like? What are those regular expenses usually come up to be per month? Yeah, like if you spend on utilities, groceries and the mortgages.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : I haven't done anything wrong anything at that post 15 years, but I'm just getting this insurance for just in case the grocery stuff, but I have I have no, no, actually I have to mortgage that's gonna that's cost me that yeah, about $8000 a month.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, fair enough.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : That's a lot of money.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So eight, $8000 a month, would that suffice as a monthly benefit?
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's, that's from the mortgage I have.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Sure, fair enough. In that case, I mean, even if we say looked maybe eight and a half, $1000 just had a little bit leftover as well in case there any other expenditures that come by, umm, a if you had a eight, yeah, sorry. OK, 10,000, sure.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : So, umm, no, actually you, you need that a month to cover monthly uh, with the 10,000 because less than 10,000, I don't think that's gonna cover my expenses because I, I well, I have, I know my expenses monthly is a lot. So my income is higher as well, but my expenses a lot as well.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fair enough.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : So that would be 10,000. Uh, that's should be OK to cover.
[7 minutes][Agent] : Well, like with that then sure. And that will still make a difference, the monthly cost. Because instead if we lower the monthly benefit amount of $10,000 a month and maintain the same 30 day waiting period and two years benefit. That'd be $300.58 per month. OK, so 300.58 per month.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : So we cannot do go invested in 1010 thousand, but, umm, $358 a month. Mm Hmm.
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : No, no, no, $300.00, so 303 double zero and $0.58 per month.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK, All right.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So .58 that much better for you mate?
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that should do it.
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, excellent.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : I just thought I had the two years paid, uh, cover.
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, two years benefit. 30 days waiting period and that's $10,000 the monthly benefit amount and that total to be $300.58 per month.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, no worries.
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. So cool. I'll just let you know quickly, uh, how the premium, the cost, the insurance works over time. Just make sure I've, I've run that by you umm and uh, let me just double check any other things here yeah. I don't believe there's anything else I need to let you know about every.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[8 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : I believe we have covered everything else before, uh, and so as a reminder, just that the premium is stepped, which reason will generally increase each year as your age, umm, and as indication, if you made no change the policy, just keeping all the same parameters next year as what you currently have, the premium next year would be $307.77 per month. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Is that is that going 10% up yearly?
[8 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : No, so it's just, uh, it's not a percentage based increase. It's, uh, the increase is based on risk as you get older and, uh, as per statistics, yeah uh, it's not necessarily correct because it's still high risk as you get all tonight. I understand where you're coming from, but no, that's not how it functions.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : What what if I not no claim in the year that should be going down, not going up with one year is not with one year is not going to be coming different with older or younger.
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : MMM. Well, hey, to which what? Uh, otherwise the last steps of getting cover underwear. A simple clue.
