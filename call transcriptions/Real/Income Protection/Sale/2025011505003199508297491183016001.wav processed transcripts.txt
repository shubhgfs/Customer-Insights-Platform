[30 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you. Let's have a look and see what's going on here. OK, so it looks like you initially went through this. It's a bit quite expired. We'll see. We'll see if it's still expired or not. Bear with me, I'm sick.
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Why it's expired? It's just it's like I'm not being like I'm 30 days.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah no, no, of course. I think it was the first time and then you called in that expired and then from there, uh, we redid it, so it should be OK. Let me see why it hasn't, uh, why it's not working for you. Just checking down. I'm just reading the notes. So there's lots of notes in here in regards to this one, just because you've called in a few times. So one SEC OK.
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sure.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I don't know if maybe because we, because usually when we do this we send the one price that you would like for pre activation from memory last time you wanted to. So maybe because we sent 2 it it cancelled out something. I'm not too sure. Umm, which one did you want to activate? The one new one? OK, we'll just do it over the phone then. Umm before I go into that, have any of your health or lifestyle details changed? Yes or no?
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : The one year 1, the last it is now if you'll take, you will ask the same questions again.
[2 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : No, no, we'll just help you organise it over the phone.
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, because if if it is because I have to go, I have to leave. So it will be take time.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, of course, that's. I'm just asking if you had helped them ask details. Details have changed. So you know how we went through the questions. Have any of your answers to those questions changed? Perfect.

[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. OK. And for the address, you have Unit 2/10, Frederick St. Fawkner, Vic 3060. Is that correct?
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's have a look and see. So we've got the $2800 monthly benefit amount and you want to along with the one year benefit. And the 30 day waiting period, is that right?

[3 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : No.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Alright, 2800 a month, the benefit of that was a 30 day waiting period of Monday benefit. OK, so with this one here, just a quick recap with the Pol. This is not going to those all those questions again, don't worry. This is to give you a quick recap with this policy. It's covering you if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : We offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. And based on your income and duties, you're allowed to select select from 1000 up to $2800, the monthly benefit amount and the benefit. Options of six months, one year, 2 years of five years. So we're looking at the $2800 monthly benefit amount with the 30 day waiting period and a one year benefit. For $18.45 per fortnight. And this can cover you into your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : What?
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Just keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS and of course you do also get a rehabilitation benefit with this policy. So the rehabilitation benefit means that we can pay a reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit to a maximum of $3000 to help with rehabilitation cost loss claiming. Or we can reimburse up to six times your income, benefit towards cost of equipment or modifications required to assist your return to work. You will also get a final expenses benefit as well which pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away under this policy to assess with funeral costs.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, A quick reminder, your premium is stepped, which means that it will generally increase each year as you age. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $18.31 per fortnight for the $2800 monthly benefit amount with a 30 day waiting period and a one year benefit. OK. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website. And please be aware that all of our premium projections are indicative only and assume that you do not make any amendments to your cover. That's just an example for you there. I know you've probably already heard this last time anyway, but I just want to give you a quick recap now. Is that all it was all the information clear and understood now?
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up? Perfect. And then lastly, have you been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the last 12 months or have you experienced any ongoing symptoms or complications associated with your COVID-19 infection in the last 30 days? Yes or no?
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : No no, no.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Alright, so last part now is to organize the policy. Do you want this to come out from a BSB, an account number or a card? So the the direct Deb, when would you like the direct debit to be for the first payment?
[6 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Like the direct debit I I will pay for the like on the card.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. Oh, it looks like one SEC. Yeah, we can do a card. It looks like when the quote expired, it wasn't because of the questions expiring, it's because your BIR, you had a birthday today, so your price is based on a 27 year old now. So that means that the quote is $18.43 a fortnight based on your age. OK. So I think it actually ends up being slightly cheaper. Actually it's two. It looks like it's two cents lower.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes][Agent] : So $18.43 a fortnight for the $2800 monthly benefit amount with the 30 day waiting period and a one year benefit.
