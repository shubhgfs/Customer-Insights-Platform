So being self-employed, pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts, less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. This is the amount of the business would otherwise see sending in the event you're unable to work due to a disability. So can I ask you what is your annual pre tax income? How much do you make per year before tax?

[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So based off your duties and your income, you can select a monthly benefit amount from $1000 up to the maximum of $7000. So this is the amount that we would pay you per month if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury. Obviously, the lower you go, the cheaper is. The higher you go, the higher the premiums are.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Damn minimum night. But he hasn't.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : How much uh, what benefit amount would you like me to quote you on there 1000? Thank you. Now then you also have the option to select different waiting periods and benefit periods. The waiting period is a non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment will be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. Which waiting for you would you likely to select for your 30 days or 90 days? Keep in mind 90 days is a cheaper option.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : 90 days, please.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : 30 days is more expensive options, nine days next one. The benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness.
