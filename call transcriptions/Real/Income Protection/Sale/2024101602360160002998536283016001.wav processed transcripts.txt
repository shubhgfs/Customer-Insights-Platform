So the waiting period is a non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. Now you can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in a raise. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So which waiting period would you like me to select?
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : So 30 days, it takes up to 60 days, isn't it?

[10 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Five years. Mm Hmm.
[10 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. OK, so $7000 monthly benefit, about 30 day waiting period and five year benefit. So you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $180.70. Now, included in your policy is a rehabilitation benefit along with a final expenses benefit, which pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away to assist with funeral costs or other final expenses. Yeah, your premium is stepped, which means it would generally increase each year as you age.
