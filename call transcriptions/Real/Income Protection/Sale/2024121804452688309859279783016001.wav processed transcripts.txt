[1 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Has your situation changed in the last day?

[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Six years becau yeah, because I do not have a permanent visa.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, That's OK. That's OK.
[2 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : So that's why I don't define myself as a as a permanent resident because I don't have the visa. Thank you. OK.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : It's also if you fall into the definition of residence, so Australian resident, who me meets a person who resides in Australia at the time of application. And one of these three things, one holds an Australian or New Zealand citizenship to hold an Australian permanency visa or has been in Australia continuously for six months or more on a temporary work visa and resides in Australia. OK.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : That's me.

[2 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : That's correct. Yes.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Alright, Thanks Eva. Thanks for clarifying. That's just one of those things that we need to do.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : No worries.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, now, so, so by the way, I, I, you probably spoke about with my colleague yesterday, WH what's what's the reason for looking into income protection?
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Of course my, I am, I'm, I'm a contractor. So I, I I do work through ABN, but I do have kind of a boss and the boss requires me to get that.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, right, OK, well you are a contractor that's fine.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So, yeah, yes.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So you're self-employed, so just tell a little bit about it. So this provides a monthly income benefit paid directly to you if you are unable to work due to disabled sickness, injury and you suffer a loss of income. It's designed to help cover your bills and living costs if your salary is interrupted. You can apply if you work at least 15 hours per week. In paid employment. We offer an income benefit up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000 either if you're suddenly out of work. How long do you think you can cover your expenses? OK, no, that's not too bad. So have a think about that.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : I would say probably like a month or two, maybe two, yeah.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Because we're going to look into a waiting period. And are there any expenses that you would prioritize covering if you were unable to work?
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, Red's quite a big one.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Rent, rent a phone, Yeah. Yeah.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : And but you know, bills, groceries too. Yeah, that will need to be paid for.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : No, I would say yeah, no, definitely rent some phone, yeah.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : That's all right. Well, we, we asked you some health and lifestyle questions over the phone, like you probably did some of that yesterday to see if you're approved and this time what terms we can offer cover. Once in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS. Also keep in mind that premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible, which can make it even more cost effective for you.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : This one?
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Do you have any questions for me so far, or does that sound strange? Forward.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : No, that's that's pretty straightforward. Yes.

[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's correct. Yes. One year and four months for one year and a half, probably.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Oh, right. That's not too bad. Yeah, you've been in it for a bit. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yeah. Alright, thank you. And you are a contractor now. I just need to ask you about your employment status. Are you currently employed or self-employed?
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, self-employed.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. I'm gonna read to you our definition of pre tax income. Pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts, less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. This is the amount that the business would otherwise cease earning in the event you are unable to work due to a disability. What is your annual pre tax income?
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Can I ask you a question, would that be, would that be my best estimate for the year that is the financial year that we're going through now or what it was last year?
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yep, up to you.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Because they're going to be two very different answers.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it's up to you. 57000 Yeah, sure.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : I know for sure the one from last year, which is 67, sorry, 67, Yeah, but I know, blah, blah, blah. Sorry, but we delayed it yesterday with your colleague for my cover. I think I told her what I'm expecting next, this year. So I think it's better because it could, it's gonna be more. So I think it's better if I tell you this year. Is that OK? Sorry.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK, what would that be then?
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Uh, that's at 7:00 PM.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : What figure would you like me to record 70? Yeah, that's fine.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : See at the end of the day Eva, when you make the claim, we do take into consideration your financials. So we do look at your pre disability income. So just keep that in mind now. Now this is the duty space assessment that you want to look into again. I'm just going to reach you those questions again.
