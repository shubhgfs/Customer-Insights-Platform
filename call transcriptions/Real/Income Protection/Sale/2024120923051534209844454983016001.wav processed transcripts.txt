[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : But Marjorie, what we do for you from here is going through some questions about what you do for work as well as your health and lifestyle. So we can load up some accurate pricing in terms and conditions for you. Before we go through that though, is there any questions for me? So far all sounding pretty straightforward.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no questions for for that so far.
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : All right, perfect. Well, of course, before answering any of your questions, it's important you're aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. It's fairly to do so it could impact your coverage claims time, but it just firstly asks Marjorie, do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, per week. Yes, yes.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yes, it's your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature. We spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment.

[4 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Other than going shopping, probably not.

[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No, No, no, no, no.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : And do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation. Is a pilot or crew entertainment industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces? Or do you carry a firearm or handle explosives? And have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?

[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : And are you currently employed or self-employed?
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : I'm full time employed.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Perfect So pre tax income is the total annual meeneration paid you buyer employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses, excluding super contributions. So Marjorie, with that in mind, what is your annual pre tax income?
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Annual free tax income 92, 1000. Yes.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : 92,000 Perfect. So based on your duties and income, you can select a monthly income benefit amount from 1000 up to 5366 per month.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Mm Hmm, mm hmm. Let me take a book five times and you will be good.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So to be able to cover off sort of your essential monthly expenses, things like your mortgage, Marjorie, what amount would you like to be covered for 5000? Perfect. And then the other two things you get to choose on the policy, your waiting period and benefit. So firstly, the waiting period is the non payment period. You must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or morning days. Just keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. So, Marjorie, which waiting period would you like me to select, the 30 or the 90 days?
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : So waiting period 90 days.
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : All right, perfect. And then lastly, the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time it will pay the income benefit for only one injury or illness. And for that you're allowed to choose six months, one year, two years or five years. So Marjorie, which benefit. Would you like to select?
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : So explain that to me.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So this is the maximum amount of time that you can claim for anyone injury or illness.
[6 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK, so then it's paid. So if it it's, I choose, for example, a year. So during a year I get paid. Is that is that what you mean? Mm, hmm. Hmm. Mm.
[6 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So if you choose one year, if you suffer a disabling sickness or injury, you'd be able to claim for a maximum amount of time of one year for that disabling sickness or injury. If you're back at work after, say, six months, the claim would still finish at that stage, but you'd be able to claim for a maximum of one year before the claim would stop.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK, I got you. Umm, I don't know. What what? What was the what was the, Ah, the choices again. Six months, one year.
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : I say there was six months, one year, so six months, one year, two years or five years.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Oh, let's put it one year.
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And now that we've con, now we've got all of that selected for you, the next step is to go through the health and lifestyle portion of the questions to make sure you are eligible and determine your final pricing in terms and conditions. But before we do that, I just once again wanted to check with you, Marjorie, is there any questions for me so far or still sounding nice and straightforward?

[16 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So, so just, uh, so just over the $33 a week mark.
[16 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[16 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Now of course your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. That is an indication if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year would be $73.28 per fortnight. Of course you can also find information about our premium structure on our website.
[17 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[17 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Just keep in mind as all that the premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible as well, which can make it even more cost effective for you.

[17 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[17 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : But Marjorie, for the 5000 a month of income protection to help make sure we can cover your mortgage if you're unable to work at $67.29 per fortnight, would that be affordable and suitable for you?
[17 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm, mm, hmm. It's. It will be, Yes.
[17 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Perfect 3.
[17 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.

[17 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[17 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : The great thing is that even though you're covered from the end of the phone call today, we don't require upfront payment.
[18 minutes][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[18 minutes][Agent] : We actually ask you, Marjorie, when would you prefer to have the first fortnightly payment come out?
[18 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Oh. Umm. Before I do that. Wait. Give me one SEC for money. Morning. Oh, is that the shirt? The shirt I've ordered? Yeah. OK. Thank you. Yeah, before, before I go ahead with that because I'm also looking at life insurance.
[18 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : None.
[18 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : I don't know if it's something that you bundle or is that something that included in life insurance as income protection or something that it's separate.
[18 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, well the life insurance sending or the life insurance and income protection are two different policies, but we are able to have a look at both of them for you.
[19 minutes][Customer] : Mm, hmm, Mm hmm. Mm, hmm.
[19 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So we can definitely load up something for life insurance before we set the income protection up as well.
[19 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[19 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Now for life insurance, just as a bit of an intro, so that's there to provide some financial protection for your loved ones, which is going to be done through a lump sum payment if you did unfortunately pass away.
[19 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. Mm Hmm.
[19 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So I assume that lump sum would be to make sure that your loved ones cannot pay off that mortgage that you've told me about, OK? And we're able to look for you from 100,000 up to 500,000.
[19 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[19 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So Marjorie, what amount would you like to be covered for for life insurance?
[19 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[19 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. And while we load that up in terms of what you're covered for for this one.
[19 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : 500 mm hmm.
[19 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So if you're accepted, once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause.
[19 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[19 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : The only thing not covered, it's suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[19 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[19 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So that's the only waiting period on this one.
[19 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[19 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : And then in addition, there's a terminally ill advanced payment included which actually don't ever have to claim on but. Terminally ill advanced payment. So what this means is if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner in that very unfortunate case, we pay the life insurance out to you in full. So you get a while you're still alive to help with things like medical costs. And that way you can plan for the future accordingly with your loved ones, pay off the mortgage while you're still alive, that kind of thing.
[20 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Term sorry terminally ill advance spam it OK Mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm.
[20 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : But Marjorie, I do have the pricing loaded up to you for the life insurance at 500,000. Before we go through that, I wanted to check again. Is there any questions about this one? So far? It's also sounding nice and straightforward. It is included. So it's part of the life insurance, correct?
[20 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : It's it's an you know, so I just want to confirm that what you say the advance payment is not included or is included it is included, OK.
[21 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Umm, But today for the 500,000 of life insurance, the maximum level we can look at, you'd be looking at the indicative payment of $119.99 per fortnight, so just under $60.00 per week.
[21 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[21 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : And of course and of course your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. But of course, you cannot doubt of this automatic indexation each year. But with this one, just as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, a premium next year would be $153.51 per fortnight. Your benefit amount would have increased to $525,000. And of course, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. But it's Marjorie for the 500,000, that maximum level for the life insurance at $119.99 per fortnight. Would that also be AF?
[22 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : 1-1 hundred 100 Do you give me the figure again?
[22 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : $119.99 per fortnight.
[22 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : 109 90 the fortnight OK.
[22 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Would that also be affordable and suitable for you as well?
[22 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : So if I take both, that would be nearly $400.00 a month per fortnight.
[22 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So it would be $187.28 per fortnight have both policies. Now, of course, that was the maximum level of the life insurance. If we look at something that's at least there to sort of help with the mortgage for your loved ones, say something like $250,000, that'd be coming in at $60.00 per fortnight. So the total between both policies would then be $127.29 per fortnight. Marjorie, did you feel that that would be a little bit better suited for you? Would you still be happy with that? 500,000 SI $60.00 per fortnight for the life insurance.
[23 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : So if if 250 it's come to 60 you said 60 dollars fortnight so write it down 60. 254 a month. 250 yeah, I think. I think 2:50 will be possibly better.
[24 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. Well then Marjorie, the next step from here is going to be to go through the health and lifestyle questions for the life insurance as well to make sure that you're approved for that as well. But some great news is that since we've gone through the questions already for income protection, most of them are actually going to copy over. So it'll only be an extra 3 or 4 questions.
[24 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[24 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So what I'll do is just read a quick disclosure, umm, similar to the one before. And then we'll just be a couple of questions to make sure we can approve you for the life insurance as well.

If you do not take reasonable care, you may breach your duty and if this happens, your insurer may be entitled cancel your policy, decline a claim or make adjustments to the terms and conditions of your policy. So Marjorie, once again, do you understand and agree to your duty?
[25 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[25 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. So the life insurance, it just asks, have you been hospitalized with COVID-19 in the last six months or have you been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last seven days?
[25 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[25 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Does your work require you to go on the ground? Work at heights above 20 meters, dive to that's below 40 meters, Use explosives or travel tours. Experiencing war, civil unrest or work offshore?
[26 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[26 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Do you have existing life insurance policies with other life insurance companies with the combined total sum of short of more than $5 million?
[26 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[26 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And all the rest of the questions have actually you've already answered within the Income Protection 1.
[26 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[26 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So Marge, are you satisfied with the answers you've provided?
[26 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[26 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So no surprises. You are also approved for the life insurance as well. Once again, the 250,000 have covered $60.00 per fortnight.
[26 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[26 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So since you said that that level would be suitable at the moment with the income protection as well at 5000, what we'll be able to do is help provide you with some immediate cover for the life insurance and the income protection.
[26 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[26 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And as mentioned before, the great thing is we don't require upfront payment.
[26 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[26 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So, Marjorie, did you have a day that you would prefer for the first one to come out?
[26 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : It does it have to be within a week or a a month or oh the the two the Altena for January.
[27 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : It it can be any time between today and the 10th of January, so a month at any time except for obviously weekends and public holidays if we're doing fortnightly.
[27 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK, 10th of June. Between today and 10th of June, it's Friday. OK, we'll do the 10th of June. Umm, Oh no. The thing is I would like to check with other company if that's OK before I go ahead.
[27 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : The 10th of January is perfect, so OK, well we certainly can just get something sent out. So you can speak to other companies first if you prefer, but alternatively if they saw sounding affordable and suitable, what we're also able to do is still help provide you with some immediate cover. We can still have the first payment come out on the 10th of January as you've requested. And just in case, we do provide you with a 30 day cooling off. So if you decide the policy is not suitable for you and cancel within the 30 days, then you'll receive a full refund of your premium unless a claim has been made. So you'd have the advantage of having some cover already set up and in place. And you're still more than welcome to have a look at some other companies in the meantime as well if you'd like to.
