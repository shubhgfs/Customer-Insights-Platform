[1 seconds][Agent] : Hi again, Kate, thanks for your patience there. We've got a Cam from our IP team there that can help you out with going through, Yeah, getting some coverage set up for your software as well. All the best. I Kate.
[12 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[12 seconds][Agent] : Thanks. Sorry, Simon, I've confirmed with all details there as well. Thanks mate. Thanks, I appreciate it. Hi, Kate, How are you today?
[19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, good. Thanks, Mr.
[21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, very good. Thank you very much. Kate, Dave has indicated to me that you were looking at our income protection cover, that you've already taken some life insurance cover with him as well, is that correct?
[34 seconds][Customer] : That's great.
[35 seconds][Agent] : Not a problem. I know that David's confirmed your details 'cause you've just set that up, but just so I'm in the right profile, would you mind just confirming your full name and date of birth?
[44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's Train. Elizabeth Bush, the 9th of the 4th, 1970.
[48 seconds][Agent] : Very good. And again, I'm sure that David's already confirmed this, but just confirming your gender and residency is it does impact the I income protection application. You're a female Australian resident, is that correct?
[1 minutes][Customer] : Thanks.
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Very good. Now a again also just letting you know that calls are recorded. Any advice provided is general in nature may not be suitable to your situation. So, Kate, with respect to our income protection insurance, it's pretty simple. We'll just go through some basic information about your duties that you're gonna face in your workplace to understand what terms we can provide you. I'll then take you through a little bit of information about how the cover works, pull up some costs to confirm, but then ultimately we'll need to confirm your eligibility by taking you through some health and lifestyle questions. Now David's just gone through that application for the life cover. A lot of those questions double up, so you won't need to re answer them. I'll just confirm with you that your answers have remained the same. But we'll we'll have to quickly go through that just to make sure that you are eligible. And if you are eligible, we can then arrange put that in place if you're happy with the terms and conditions. OK. Now, with respect to what your needs are with income protection insurance, just for my own context of where you currently are and, and what you're looking to do, umm, have you ever held cover, uh, in terms of income protection before?
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Sure, Yep, yes, so there is I do currently have a a a policy and that's what we're reviewing. So it's it's not might in with our self managed super and we've just done a review of that and I'm not very happy with the they're right. They are in working in the card.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, sure. So you're, you've got to make a protection and cover in place, but the the cost is a little bit exorbitant and you're hoping to find something that's more suitable.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Sure. And do you understand Kate, that with the policy that we can provide to you, it's not set up through a self managed superon. It's a direct insurance.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : One of the advantages of that is that the income protection premiums you pay are generally tax deductible. So it can actually make it quite cost effective for you. Well worth speaking to your tax advisor about how you can do that. Or if you do your own taxes on the government's My Gov website, you can put in your details and get an assessment of what you should be able to recently say through that tax transaction.
[3 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no problem.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, so, and obviously with the, the idea of income protection is it's there to provide a monthly income benefit paid directly to you if you aren't able to work due to the same sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. And just to be clear as well, OK, we offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income anywhere as a minimum from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000 based on your earnings and, uh, health and lifestyles. Now, a, as I said, we'll take you through some help and lifestyle questions to confirm your eligibility if you are approved, and then we'll confirm with us exactly what terms we can provide. Once the cover's in place, it will cover you until the policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Just keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS. OK, now Kate, if you don't mind me, just quickly reading a, a statement to you and I'll ask a few duty space assessment questions. So it just says before answering any of our questions, it is important that you're aware of your duty to answer all of that questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your current plan's time. The first question just asks about your hours per week, so that do you work 15 hours or more per week, yes or no? Thank you. And is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment? And what do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking? OK, OK, sure. And what sort of industry are you in?
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, it is project manager, defence industry.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. And is that something you've gotten into as a civilian or have you worked, like, have you surfed in the military? Yeah, very good. And do you enjoy?
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : No, as as it's me I did.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Oh, very good. Are you where? Whereabouts do you guys base? Where do you work? Oh, OK.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Right on me with my normal, normal location.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK. Yeah, not, not too far away from us. We're based in the northwest of Sydney. Do you know Bella Vista or Norwest? Yeah, that's where we're located.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Like I grew up in, I think so not far from out on here at all. Umm, Now I it just asks are you required to perform any physical duties?
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces? Or do you carry a firearm or handle explosives? OK, it's loading up and it's gonna ask me to confirm your smoking status. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Very good. Now I'm going to go through a a few options with you. OK to figure out the best circumstances. Just to start with I need to GI confirm your employment status. Are you self-employed or employed?
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Employed.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : And I'm, I'm now going to give you a definition of the pre tax income. It's the total annual remuneration paid to you by an employee before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses, excluding super contributions. With that definition in mind, are you able to give me an annual income before tax?
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : It's yeah, 110.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Your annual income a 110,000.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : All right.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : So you said before super. Like not not including super, Yeah.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So it's the total, a annual remuneration paid due by an employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses, but excluding super contributions.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes][Agent] : Perfect. Thanks. That's on the spot. Thank you very much. Which means that the range of cover that we're looking at at this stage, Kate, is $1000 as a minimum up to $6416.00 as a maximum for a monthly benefit amount. Now at this stage, I find it really helpful for people to have a little bit of a think about or a breakdown of what your critical costs would be if something happened to you and, and you weren't able to work due to the same sickness or injury and you then suffer the loss of income. So what are the main ticket items Kate? What would you need to be covering off? Have you got, for example, mortgage loan repayments, rental costs, food costs, etcetera?
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : That would be yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And ballpark figure out per month what would that look like?
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Look, mortgage would be the predominant 1 per month.
[7 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Sure, Sure.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : So obviously both of us contribute to that, but I guess to, to make sure that it was covered and that way you probably wouldn't have to worry about anything else because the other person would still be, you know, been doing something.
[8 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : We'd be covering off the other expenses. Yep, Yep. Touch wood.
[8 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : So you're looking, you're looking at oh, say round about 2600 a month.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, so if we insured you for a monthly cost of $2600, that would at least cover off the mortgage, allowing your partner to cover off the other living expenses until you're back on your feet.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. That, that would be.
[8 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Have I got the right of it as a buffer? Yeah. Well, you've got, you've got, as I said, you've got that range from 1000 up to 6416 dollars. Obviously I'm just trying to E establish what that baseline would be. So we're not over insuring you for no reason. But it's up to you Kate, you you can go anywhere you want between those ranges.
[8 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : So I'm just thinking whether we should have a little bit more leeway there in terms of yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes][Agent] : Fair enough. Sure.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : So I, I think if we went for 3 1/2, but I think, I think that would be, you know, he would take the, the stress away. Mm, hmm.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yep, understood.
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Let's work on the 3 1/2 and, and if we need to no, uh, navigate further once we've confirmed your eligibility, we can at least play around with those figures. OK, so then the next thing that I want you to nominate as a starting point is the waiting period. And that's the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the Intuit event. You can choose either 30 days or 90 days. Please just keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears, meaning that if you choose for example, a 30 day waiting period, you would expect your first payment to be 60 days after your first eligible claim. Now in terms of cost difference, the 90 day waiting period is approximately 40% cheaper than the 30 day waiting period. Meaning that if you think you can go a reasonable period of time on say for example, sick leave or accrued saving, a good way of making a cost save in terms of the expense of the income protection insurance. But obviously again, it's entirely up to you. OK, which one would you like to sleep? OK, perfect. Yep.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : N90 day I think should be sufficient so that sorry, just to to clarify that's an in initial waiting period you're talking about or at any time that you need to call on this right, right, OK.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : A A at any time you're making, you're submitting a claim for an injury with illness, you'd have to for each injury or illness, you need to wait that first waiting period.
[10 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK. So, so sorry. It's not going to stop you receiving. It should say those payments would be delayed.
[10 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's not not quite right in I mean what I what I mean by by that it's only in so far as if you were to fully recover before that waiting period had been served out, then you wouldn't be entitled to receive payments. If by the end of that waiting period you were still unable to work because of a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income, then that benefit.
[11 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : OK, gotcha. Alright. So there's the options are 90 days or 30 days, OK.
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Would commence and those payments would commence, but being paid in arrears, OK, Correct, Correct, correct.
[11 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : And the 90 days is approximately 40% cheaper overall on the premiums, OK, Alright.
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[11 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : So let's go with the 90 days and we I could change that or increase like change it to 30 if if I wanted to or needed to.
[11 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Before we commence the the policy, at the moment we're just selecting figures to get an idea of the cost. We can play around with these figures before putting anything in place.
[11 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[11 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Once this is in place, you can always reduce your risk to the insurer. But if you're looking to increase your risk to the insurer, you would have to resubmit your eligibility at the time. So assuming that you are eligible, then you could look to increase your coverage, but it would be subject to your eligibility of time.
[12 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : OK. So that's on that basis. I will go with the 30 days and see what it is and then can you drop it down?
[12 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Sure, easy work W backwards if we need to, sure thing.
[12 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : No problems. Kate, thanks for explaining. Now the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. You've got a choice between six months, one year, two years or five years. What would you like to select as a starting point?
[12 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK. So this is for the length of time that the benefit is payable. Have I got that right?
[12 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yes, there's a maximum. So obviously if you were to for example, make a claim and then you're recovered and returned to work before that benefit. Had been reached, then tha those payments would obviously cease if you've returned back to work.
[13 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[13 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : But if if you're still injured, that's the maximum benefit.
[13 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK. OK. And so our options were six months.
[13 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Or if you're still sick, excuse me, six months, one year, two years or five years. And just to clarify my statement, still injured or I or sick and still suffering a loss of income.
[13 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[13 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : You've got it. Yeah.
[13 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : And again, I'm assuming the premiums are impacted by the future. Yep.
[13 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : The higher the Amo, how the higher the benefit. The higher the cost. The lower the benefit. The lower the cost.
[13 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : And I'm assuming similar to the previous one, changing it may be subject to having to restart again.
[13 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : If you again, if you go up, so for example, if you started at the six months umm benefit. Paid and you wanted to increase it, then you would need to reconfirm your eligibility. If you started the five years and wanted to decrease, you can freely do that in any stage because it it's representing a lower risk to the insurer.
[13 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Basically, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Understood. I look, I think I.
[14 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Yep. Though I feel like you're locking these in. By the way, we can definitely play with all these figures once we've got an idea of the cost. What I wanted firstly do is just G go through those questions so that we can know all the extenuating circumstances as especially with income protection, they can often be either exclusions or particular conditions placed on the policy based on your health circumstances. So I'm gonna run through those questions as quickly as I can, and once we've got those in place, we'll go through those costs. OK, so I'm going to quickly reread the disclosure statement. You've probably heard the same thing they read to you a moment ago, but it's just technically a different policy.
[14 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Let's start at the two year Yep, Yep, Yep, sure.
[14 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So I'll reread it for you. OK? It says please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes. We collect your personal information to provide interim quotes, issue cover and other related services. We'll share this with your insurer and may share it with other Australian service providers for the purpose of administering the policy of handling claims. Our privacy policy tells you more, including how to access and collect your information and lodge complaints about breaches of privacy. By proceeding, you understand that you're applying to purchase an Income Protection policy and as such, you have a duty to take reasonable care to not make any misrepresentations. This means that you need to ensure that you understand each question I ask you and you provide honest, accurate and complete answers. You need to answer each question in full, even if you have provided some information to us in any lead discussions you have had. If you do not take reasonable care, you may breach breach your duty, and if this happens, your insurer may be entitled to cancel your policy, decline the claim, or make adjustments for the terms and conditions of your policy. I think I might have said life insurance policies at the start just in case. I did just clarifying that you're you're proceeding, you understand, you're applying to purchase an income protection policy. So if I said it the wrong way around, I apologize, Kate, I might have done that by a fraud in slip, but just confirming that you understand and agreed to your duty.
[16 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[16 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much. Now, umm, with, uh, the questions, just like before, they're all yes or Nos. It's going to pre fill any of the answers you've already given today. So just give me a moment while that loads up. And while I'm waiting for that to load, I'm just gonna confirm that everything that you answered with David, uh, is all true and correct. Is there anything that you were unsure about or I need to revisit with the questions you've already answered with David?
[16 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : No.
[16 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what I'm gonna just quickly do is with the questions you already answered, I'm just gonna re quickly rephrase the question and confirm that you're you're happy with your answer. And then with the ones that are fresh, I'll read them and ask you to respond. OK, so the first question is with respect to COVID, I know you've already answered the code's question, but for the income protection insurance, it's slightly different.
[17 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : No.

[18 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[18 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : With the AIDS declaration, you've to the best of your knowledge, are you infected with or are you in a high risk category of contracting HIV which causes AIDS? You've answered no, correct.

[18 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Correct that that is correct.
[18 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : And it says do you intend to replace your existing cover with this application, assuming that of course, that the terms and conditions are favourable?
[18 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, correct.
[18 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And in the medical section, just reminding you the overarching question it is, have you ever had symptoms or been diagnosed with or treated for or intend to seek medical advice any of the following you've answered? No for all the initial questions. So I'll just quickly run through them and just get you to quickly say correct or not correct.

[20 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : And blood disorder or disease, again, you've entered no, is that correct?
[20 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[20 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : And then the last one was asthma or the respiratory disorder, excluding childhood asthma, you've answered no, Is that correct?
[20 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[20 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Great. I've got a couple more to an add to that section. California, OK. And this one asks back or neck pain or disorder, yes or no? This is your medical history for all the time. So I'll remind you of the overarching question, which is have you ever had symptoms of, been diagnosed with or treated for or intend to seek medical advice for any of the following? So back or neck pain or disorder, yes or no? Sure. And then it asks, are you on restricted work du duties or have limited mobility? And have you had symptoms requiring treatments in the last two years?
[20 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK, sorry, I just wanna clarify currently ever right, Yes, I would have to say yes, yes, no, no.
[21 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : And did you have surgery to treat this condition?
[21 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yes, 2015. For my back.
[21 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, so you had some sort of surgery through the back of the neck to help with the pain or disorder? Sure.
[21 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : For my back, yeah.
[21 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, So when you answer yes to that question, it says that there's gonna be an exclusion Pennsylvania placed on the policy based on back disorder with surgery. So it says no benefit will be payable for any disability, condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to or arising from the spine, including it's invertible discs, nerve roots, supporting musculature or ligament. So that's based on your disclosure. OK. Now obviously it doesn't prevent you from taking the cover. It's just saying there's an exclusion based on those circ circumstances. All right. Hey, the next question is arthritis, chronic pain, gout, repetitive strain injury, chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia, joint or muscle pain, ligament injuries including a replacement or reconstructive surgery, osteoporosis or osteopenia and any of the effective hearing or sight other than which is corrected by glasses or contact lenses.
[22 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no.
[22 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, very good. The next section was still medical history, just more recently and you've under the question other than what you've already told me about in the past three years, have you thought medical advice or treatment by a medical practitioner specialist or are you awaiting results for any medical tests or investigations such as they're not limited to any surgeries, X-ray scans, both types of biopsy. You've answered no, is that still correct? And other than what you've already told me about, are you contemplating sick medical advice? And since you're currently experiencing within the next two weeks, again, you've answered no, is that still correct? And then Kate had asked, other than what you've already told me about, have you ever during your work car working career required more than two consecutive weeks off due to illness or injury?
[23 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yes, which would be when I had my deck operation.
[23 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Oh, it's it's specifically says other than what you already told me about.
[23 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK, right.
[23 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So we don't need to redisclose that any any other reason why you'd answer yes to that one?
[23 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK then, bye bye.
[23 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Yeah, Thanks, Kate. And now the family history questions, you've answered no for both. So just reminding you to the best of your knowledge of any of your immediate family living or deceased and being diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, Huntington's disease or familial out of the Martin's polarposis, you've answered no, that's still correct. And to the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family suffered from cancer, heart condition, stroke or other hereditary disease prior to age 60 and you've answered no, Is that correct? Last question, Kate, I appreciate your patience. It says other than one off events, gift certificates or vouchers, do you engage in or can you engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fair paying passenger on a recognized airline, motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering at sailing, scuba diving deep in the 40 meters, cable rate diving or any other hazardous activity? You've answered no for that. Is that still correct?
[23 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Correct, correct, correct.
[24 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Great. I'm answering that. Sorry, closing out that application. Give me one second and we can have a look at those on all details for you. So based on your disclosure in the application, it's provided you with the exclusion that I've already explained to you about your back disorder with surgery and then it's also added a cost due to your height to weight ratio. OK. So you'd be mine. Now what that means from a practical standpoint is if we're looking at a monthly benefit amount of three and a half, $1000 with a waiting period of 30 days and a benefit period of two years, you'd be expected to pay on a fortnightly basis $138.80. Now we've got scope to play with these amounts to try and find something that's more affordable if you need to do that. But there's a starting point. Where does that leave you in comparison to what you've got in in place at the moment? $138.80 per fortnight. Sure, sure.
[25 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Let me sorry, 138, let me just do that like that so I can yeah, yeah, it looks that that's better.
[25 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK. Absolutely.
[25 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : But I do have to also have a look at what the terms are on that because I'm I'm not currently familiar with like in terms of the benefit. Or the waiting.
[25 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : I I completely agree, I think it's imperative that you have a look at it and make sure it is suitable to your circumstances. One of our advice, key pieces of advice to anyone looking to replace an existing policy with ours, Kate, is you don't cancel it until you've been fully approved for us. You'd have the opportunity to review it in full, compared it side by side to make sure it is suitable to your needs.
[25 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[26 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : And of course, considering the benefits may not require or any waiting periods that may start again. So what I'd ideally like to do is make sure that this is a suitable policy for you. Uh, ignoring your existing policy for one second, make sure that this, the terms and conditions of this policy is actually suitable here needs. I'm assuming that we find something that you you're happy with, umm, and fits your budget. I'll arrange to send documents out for you to review side by side against your existing policy. We can start the cover immediately and forward date a first payment for you. So you've got that time to review it side by side and make sure it's suitable while still knowing that you've got a continuity of coverage so that when you look to cancel out your existing policy, if you wanted to do that, you'll have our cover already in place.
[26 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[26 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now, of course you're not obliged to do that. OK, I'm happy to send out a, a quote for you irrespective. So you've got those two choices, but that's our usual process is to assist you by getting that coverage in place, sending out the documents for your review and giving you that time to look at them side by side. The other thing that I want you to be aware of with this cover is it is a step premium. So please understand you should expect it to increase each year as your age. As an indication for you, Kate, if you were to make no changes to the policy, your premium in the next year would go to $149.71 a fortnight.
[27 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[27 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : And you can always find further information about our premium structure on our website. But there's two things that are also included in our policy that you may not be aware of. And the first is a rehabilitation benefit OK that pays a reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit to a maximum of $3000 to help you with any rehabilitation costs whilst claiming. Or we can reimburse up to six times your income benefit towards cost of equipment or modifications required to assist you to return to work. In the event that that happens, try and get you back as soon as possibly can. The other thing that we include in our cover is a final expenses benefit, which pays out $10,000 to chosen loved ones in the event that you pass away while you're holding the policy. Knock on wood, of course, I hope you have a long, happy, healthy life, but Peace of Mind that there's a little bit of extra protection there as well. OK, now the only other thing I wanted to clarify is with the the cost. I know that you're saying it's a little bit better than or like in terms of costs at least a little bit better than what you're currently paying. But is that still affordable? Because I mean, obviously it's been exploring this in the 1st place because of the cost. Did you want me to look at a a different benefit. Or a different waiting period or lower the monthly benefit amount to try and find something that fits the budget better?
[28 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Could we take a look at the if the benefit. Was six months.
[28 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. So if we were to switch it to a six month benefit. Instead of the two year benefit. It'd change the cost per fortnight. Wait a second. Looks like it's not off your application. I'm just gonna load your application back onto it to give you the right cost. One second. Sorry, Kate, it's just taking a moment.
[29 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[29 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : It would be $86.03 a fortnight in that case.
[29 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[29 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : What do you what do you thoughts? Would that make more sense? Or are you thinking the two years is worth the difference in cost?
[29 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I'm, I'm thinking the the six months.
[29 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Yeah.
[29 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[29 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : And and from a budget perspective, you're comfortable with $86.03 a fortnight.
[29 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. I think that's that's more than reasonable on on that basis.
[29 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. So as I said, if you feel comfortable with that and you're happy for me to arrange to get that started for you, I would then need you to select the first payment date in the future. Now, if you want me to line it up to the same date as you've set that, uh, life insurance policy, I can do that for you. Umm, did, yeah. Have you got a particular preferred first, uh, uh, date as the fir, uh, the first payment date?
[30 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, 18th would be appropriate.
[30 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So just a month from today.
[30 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : 18th of December, sorry.
[30 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Sure. OK, so we're nominating the 18th of December as the first payment date and with the provisor that if you need to make any changes before that date rolls around, well, you don't want to proceed. Of course, Call us back straight away and let us know.
[30 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 18th of December, Yep.
[30 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : If we reached the 18th of December and we haven't heard back from you, we're gonna assume that you're happy with the terms and conditions and we'll take that first deduction from your chosen account and the policy will take force in earnest from that date. Despite the fact that that's the first date. The policy takes force in earnest from the end of this phone call. Once you accept, accept the declaration statement, we'll still have you immediately protected. OK. And then we'll shoot the documents out to you in the post.
[31 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : And and then no. And does it work the same in Li as life insurance in terms of the 18th of December? And then there's still a 30 day cooling off.
[31 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : That's. That's correct. Yeah.
[31 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Beyond that, Yep.
[31 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK. So if you're happy with the that arrangement, Kate, can I ask you to confirm the type of payment method you'd prefer? Do you want to set this up as a direct debit or is a Visa or MasterCard? And I don't have your banking details, They're already securely encrypted. I'll need you to give them to me again, please. Is it a savings or a cheque account? And the BSP and account number please? Yep. OK, so 720, sorry. Yeah, 9/9 3.
