[1 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes, We've started our own business. So a lot of the, yeah, companies that we'll be doing work for require a copy of personal income insurance.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : I want to take a look at this coverage today 690 like I still be able to access some certain sites so they as it's a requirement of this insurance. No, that's all. I mean the great thing about organizing this coverage here at real insurances, see what you can obviously tell you this coverage so that you need to run your budget and it's all done over the phone. So there's no need to have to book any doctor's appointments, have any medicals and budgets and things like that.
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : But umm, it said we just asked umm, you somehow from lifestyle questions over the phone to even see if you are approved and if so, on what terms that we can also cover. But umm, what's the place? We'll cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Umm just keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS, but the way our cover works is that we we offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. And umm this is designed to be paid out as a monthly income benefit paid directly to you Stephen if you are unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. OK.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yeah, yeah. OK.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : But do you guys have any questions so far?
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : The only question I've got is, is this insurance, personal injury insurance? Is it the same thing?
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So this is what we refer to it as being as income protection policy. So it gets paid out as a monthly benefit, a fee is unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury, and he suffers a loss of income.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm only asking because they in the e-mail, they've asked for personal injury insurance.
[3 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's right.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : So that's what I'm wondering is, is that the same thing as income insurance?
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : I'm just have the chip of payment. We we this is what we refer to this as this policy may, but I do speak to many customers in a position that's where you know, it's a requirement to have this type of insurance to be able to access certain sites. For customers that do take out insurance, we do provide them with, you know certificate of currency as proof as well. So if they need to show that to the employer, anyone in particular as proof?
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : OK, cool.
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, so did you guys have any other questions so far?
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : No, not yet.

[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. South employed.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So if your your main occupation, we work the most hours in is that being self-employed or employed. So just to help determine how much cover that we can offer you or provide you with the definition of pre tax income. So being self-employed to pre tax income is your sheet of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal If it's list any business expenses and excludes super contributions.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[6 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I, I don't know. I've just started for myself. When I worked for my old company, it was 130. I think it was the year.

[6 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, we just started on two weeks or two months ago.
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Did you guys just start your business 02 months? OK, now that's all right. I'll just double check that for you. Umm, because, uh, with your casual role, is that something? Are you doing the same occupation? You're just doing it?
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Umm, OK, no, that's all right.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : That we, we, we, yeah. We need I think 10 grand a month for that.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So because looking at the, the, the monthly benefit amount, was that something you have, If you guys given that any for like how much cover you would require 10 grand a month.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, so just if we note that down, let's say $10,000 a month, I'll just need to confirm here. Uh, can you please confirm that the total annual income for tax is at least $171,400? Yep. And we see the cover to You also have the options to choose different waiting periods and benefit periods. The first first one is the waiting period. Now this is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. And with this you can choose 30 days or 90 days. But just keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. Which means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll take we'll take a 30 day one.
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : But yeah, cool. And then you've got the benefit. Which is the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Oh, can you write down the difference of that?
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : And with this, you can choose six months, one year, two years or five years, yes. So obviously the, the, the longer the benefit. The more premiums you're paying and vice versa. Umm, the listed, the benefit proof, the list of the premiums, because it just means that if you were to make a claim, umm, this benefit.
[8 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Yeah, Yeah. I think we're to go the six months one.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Will just determine how long or the maximum amount of time that we'll pay this monthly benefit, umm, directly to you uh, for each, umm, when you want to injure your illness yeah cool.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So if you're looking as an indicative point to start off, you're looking at say the monthly benefit amount of the $10,000 based off the waiting period of 30 days and a benefit period of six months fortnightly that is $88.17. OK, but what what are your initial?
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. My wife gave thumbs up. So yeah, she's, she's she's sign up. Yeah. I'm happy with that.
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, cool. Well, Next up here is I'll just update all your contact details. Well, both for these health questions, so we can check your eligibility. We'll just keep in mind that the premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible, which can make it even more cost effective for you.
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : But the one thing that we do have as part of our policy is a real award. So following your first policy anniversary date, we will be refunding you back 10% of the premiums that you've paid to us in that time, which would be $229.25. So it does work out to be over a month's worth of premiums there. But did you guys any of you have any questions at this stage?
[9 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no, no, no, I don't think so.
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : We don't actually do public liability, unfortunately. Is that something you guys are needed to? Was it a requirement?
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : I think the only other do you do public liability we have to go umm, but I still have all. I might as well keep all the insurances with one. But that's right. I'll just keep it with who we put up with.
[9 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Cool. No, that's all right. And look, just with this policy as well, Stephen included, at no extra cost, there is a rehabilitation benefit along with a final expenses benefit, which pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away just to assist with funeral costs or other final expenses. So those features included in the cover at no extra cost there and your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. But I'll show you how that all what that looks like as well. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $92.73 a fortnight.
[10 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : But you can also find information about our premium structure on our website if you wish to as well.
