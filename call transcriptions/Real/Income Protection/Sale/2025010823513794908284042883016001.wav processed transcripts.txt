[0 seconds][Agent] : Thanks so much for holding Damien. So I've got Bridget on the line now from our customer support department so she can help you nominate your mum as a beneficiary for the final expenses benefit on the policy.
[10 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Right.
[10 seconds][Agent] : And Bridget just moved. Damien has already confirmed his full name, date of birth, address, phone, e-mail and policy part. A big thanks for that, Luke. Hi, Damien, Nice Bridget from the customer support team. How are you today?
[10 seconds][Customer] : That I'm good. Thanks.
[25 seconds][Agent] : I'm good. Thank you so much for asking. So I believe we're just adding your mum down as the beneficiary for this one.
[24 seconds][Customer] : How you doing? Yep.
[33 seconds][Agent] : Ye.
[32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that'd be good.
[34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Perfect. So just quickly, before we update your beneficiary, I do just need to make you aware that when you nominate a beneficiary, you as the policy owner are providing an instruction on who to pay the policy benefit to in the event of your death. And this nomination will be processed in accordance with the conditions set out in your PDS. So can you please confirm you understand this and the information you'll provide is true and correct. Perfect. And what was your first name?
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Lorraine. LA double Raine. Yeah.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So it was LA Double Raine, did you say? Perfect. So I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss here. And what was her surname?
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Robinson.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Same 1 Wilson and her date of birth. And that was your mother. And does she have a different address to yourself?
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : The seventh of the 12th, 1955, No same address.
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. I can copy that one from your profile. And do you have a phone number for her you would like us to have?
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, give me two seconds. It is 0413 393253.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, I'll just save her details and just looking to give her 100% of the benefit when you pass.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Just be a moment while I save that for you. OK, that one's all been done for you. So we have your mum Lorraine down as the beneficiary now. So what will happen? As you've just started the policy, the welcome pack I believe still includes automatically a beneficiary form, but we'll then send you a separate letter out just showing you've already added the beneficiary over the phone today. So when you receive that one, just double check I've taken her details down correctly for you. And it's just important to know if she has any updates or details in the future that you give us a call to update our records just so there's no unnecessary delay during the claims process, which you'll have to supply a proof of identity.
[3 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. No worries.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : But that's all done. Let's set this one up. And we've just added your mom as the beneficiary. Was there anything else I could help you with today?
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No, that's fine. Thanks.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : No problem. I hope you have a lovely day.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Beautiful. You too.
[3 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much. Bye.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : See ya.
