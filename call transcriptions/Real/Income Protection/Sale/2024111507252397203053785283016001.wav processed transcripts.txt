[7 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : What's? So the income each it is including all the expenses, the company expenses or?
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Let me reread that part again. So, so it's his share of annual income earning the business before tax. Now this would be directly due to his own personal efforts less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. So this would be the amount that the business would unwise cease earning in the event to unable to work due to disability.
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK. So that's excluding expenses. Yeah, yeah, Yeah, Yeah, yeah. OK. I'll just ask him. Sorry. Give me a moment.
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so ex Yeah, minus the business expenses and excluding super contributions, Yeah, sure. No worries.
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : It's around roughly around 80,000.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure, $80,000. So based on his duties and his income, he can select the monthly benefit amount from $1000 up to a maximum monthly benefit amount of $4666.00. So just have a think about how much he he needs to cover those expenses while it's off work. But in that range, what amount would you like me to quote on $4000? Yeah, sure. And also, once I get that price, that SMB, we can always play on the figures and things like that. And yeah, find out which one you feel is more suitable moving forward. Yeah.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : 4 weekly, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem. Yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Now the waiting period, Sandy, this is the non payment period that he must wait before the income benefit is payable after insurance. Now he can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly. You know it is meaning if he chooses a 30 day waiting period, his first payment will be 60 days after your first eligible claim. Now which waiting period would you like me to select?
[10 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Let me ask again, sorry. Just give me a moment.
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK.
[10 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : I'll go for two months.

[10 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK, right. So 30 days and the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. These options are six months, one year, two years or five year benefit. Which benefit. Would you like me to select?
[11 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : So 6 months, one year and five years.
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, six months, one year, 2 years, five years. Which one? Which one would you like me to select?
[11 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Is that what? Sorry. I'll ask him again, What benefit do you should it go? Yeah. So let, we will go for now, for one year.

[11 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Not really. Not at the moment.
[11 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. All good. So I'll just get that price for you and just keep in mind that, you know, if he's also approved for this cover, there are other components included like a final expenses benefit that pays $10,000 in the effect that he passes away that could help out with things like final expenses. And there's also a rehabilitation benefit included in there as well. So based on what you've just told me, the monthly premium, $102.38 a month, does that sound affordable for your husband?
[12 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think it should be alright.
[12 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, got you.
[12 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll ask him otherwise. Yeah, because we also have, he also got a life insurance with you like with the real insurance.
[12 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Oh, all right. OK. Yeah. So he might have already heard about the. So this would be something to compliment his wife, something on top.
[12 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[12 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, no worries now then that's good. He, he might already know about the real reward. So following his first policy anniversary date, we will refund 10% of the premiums that we paid, that he's paid in that time. So from that premium of $102.38 a month, What this means is that his refund under the reward would therefore be $122.86. So that's what I said. Thanks.
[13 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So after the 1st anniversary, is it?
[13 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, first year anniversary.
