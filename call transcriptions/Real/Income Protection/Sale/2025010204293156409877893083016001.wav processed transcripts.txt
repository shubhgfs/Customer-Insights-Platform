Alright, thank you. That comes the end of those questions. I'll just check on the outcome for you. Just while I do that, just to recap, so income protection is a monthly income benefit paid directly to you unable to work. You do save me sickness or injury and you suffer loss of income and premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible, which can make it even more cost effective for you.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : No, wonderful.
[9 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So some great news. Congratulations Alexandra, you have been approved for the income protection cover. Well done.
[9 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's so nice.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : That's good to see. And your application is approved with the low term, so the maximum benefit amount and the benefit. Is $5000 monthly benefit amount and a two year benefit. This is due to stomach ulcer. There's also been a premium adjustment due to stomach ulcer. So we're taking all that on board. There's a couple of exclusions here. Now due to the way that you've answered the self-employed business continuity question. This exclusion applies for you self-employed business continuity. The income protection benefit will be reduced by any income you receive or are entitled to receive from any business you have an interest in subsequent to the statement date. This adjustment will only apply where the total amount of the benefit payable plus the ongoing income exceeds 70% of your pre distillate income.
[10 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[10 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : And just at the way you answered the stomach ulcer question. This exclusion applies to you stomach ulcer. No benefit will be payable for any disability, condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to or arising from stomach. Awesome. So. But again, you've been approved so well done once again. So based on a $5000 monthly benefit amount and a 30 day waiting period and a six month benefit. The final premium $102.80 a fortnight. Alexandra, how's that all sounding so far?
[10 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm. That sounds, that sounds doable. Sounds good.
[10 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, all good. And I'll just bring up the premium projection as well. So it all our premium objections are indicative only and assume that you do not make any amendments with the account as an indication, Alec. And if you make no change to the policy, your premium next year will be $113.60 a fortnight.
[10 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[10 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So just give you a bit of an idea of what it might look like in the coming year. And a real reward is also attached to income protection policies. So following your first policy anniversary date, we will refund 10% of the premiums you paid that time.
[11 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[11 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So $267.28 will be your refund under.
