[41 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK. So this is less any business expenses and excluding super contributions?
[41 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Uh, is the Taco printer so doesn't know it's a superannuation Depends. You know, like you do the my son said to sell it. Actually, there's uh, yes, go ahead. I can only roughly estimate that because I only just started working.
[42 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's, that's perfectly fine. Uh, I will note this is the amount that the business. So you, as a sole trader, would otherwise cease earning in the events you were unable to work due to a disability.
[42 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : I would say 50 1000 per E gross income. So you California you don't have a scale like a a certain certain groups of income for example, between that amount to that amount is one group and then rather than exact project amount.
[43 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sorry, uh, I don't need necessarily to use the exact amounts, Umm, because you mentioned your annual income before tax was around $50,000. Is that correct? Same or more? Yeah.
[43 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : That is very rough, yes. I don't know how long the work will last, there be much work etcetera, but that would be kind of roughly rough projection, yes. Yes. So I would know a lot more accurately next year based on this year, yeah.
[44 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Perfectly fine because if we work off the annual income before tax being $50,000, uh it means we can offer a monthly benefit amounts anywhere between $1000 up to $2916.00 a month at the maximum. Umm, would a certain amounts be preferable for you?
[45 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Message me. Uh, monthly roughly 2 1/2 thousand. So 2500, that would probably be the rough estimate per month, no?
[45 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Sure, no problems in that case, the two and a half, $1000 a month. I'll just double check here. Umm, that your total, uh, going You can confirm your total annual income before tax is at least $42,900. Would it be the same or more than that?
[46 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : The message not really could not minimum to the best it did we to the best it did they hear that they should talk really talk with the same to the best they hear.
[46 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : But that works. That's what I actually said. That works.
[46 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Oh, well, let's start with that. If you just put that 42,000 just because I really don't know exact exactly now, but if you put that, that should be fine.
[46 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK. Because yes, I just need to confirm that the total annual income before tax is at least $42,900. So this is either the same or more. Would that be correct? Yes or no?
[46 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : The minimum to the best they the most the minimum, yes.
[47 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : The OK, excellent. Now there are two other factors that go into income protection insurance. Both of these are in relation to when you make a claim on the insurance.
[47 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : 'Cause there's no factor in the mall that go to no police, OK?
[47 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : First of all, there is the waiting. This is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured events.
[48 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[48 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm. Now the options are 30 days or 90 days, Uh, and keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. Uh, so it's back paid. So meaning if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim.
[48 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : 'Cause we met the perio D uh, so I'm quite track it. There must be zapate tetriti citadana pepperio, uh Naplatra. Yeah Eli David de Citadana, uh Yenna FRA bruga, uh Festa Plaza Unazad to sell the message message on the Sorry, I don't know So understand those 60 days. I understand the words, but just how to So if you umm, you can choose the, the non payment period, that's fine.
[49 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Hmm, 30 or 90 days?
[49 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : 30 or 60 days and you're paying your premiums or 3090 days, sorry.
[49 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Uh, yeah.
[49 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : And then you're paying your premiums. Sorry, the first premium. Umm, sorry, the the first premium you need to pay. So you basically start your, uh, policy, start your insurance today. You will only pay after 30 days.
[49 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So no, it's that's not, that's not what how it works. It's in relation to when you make a claim on the insurance, there is a non payment period that you'd wait before the income benefits. So the what he's insured for is payable after the insured event being the sickness or injury keeping him off work. Hmm. And so, mm.
[49 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Alright, yeah, so if he chooses 30 days non payment, it will be paid umm, only after 30 days, not straight away.
[50 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : It's actually it's a slightly different to that. It means the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears, so it is back paid to him. So it means if he chooses a 30 day waiting period, the first payment would be 60 days after he was first eligible to claim because he would wait 30 days and then if the claim is still valid every 30 days after that, he is then back paid the claim. OK.
[50 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[51 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yes.
[51 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : The police, I'm sorry, for 90 days. He will then wait 180 days. Is that right?
[51 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Not 180 days, he would wait 120 days because he'll wait the 90 days and then every 30 days after that. If the claim is still valid, he will be back paid the claim every 30 days after.
[52 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Alright, yeah, OK. Yeah, I called with the.
[52 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Excellent question. Since there are multiple factors, I can't give you an exact number. However, I can state that 30 days is more expensive since it's a shorter period, whereas 90 days is much cheaper because it's longer.
[52 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : So what is the difference in the insurance in the in the cost obviously of the premium it would be different. Money.
[53 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[53 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Remed up ma nachi crachi. But yeah, you sit down and I don't know the scoop. Scoop your police. All right, I'll take 90 days.
[53 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So look at 90 days and now the waiting period, uh, sorry, not the waiting period, the benefits period. The benefit. Is the maximum amounts of time that we will pay the income benefit to anyone injury or illness. So it's the maximum amounts of time that we will pay a claim per claim.
[54 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : So it's not the maximum duration, it's the maximum amounts of time that a person can claim.
[54 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : No. So it's the maximum amount of time that we will pay the claim to them per claim that they make.
[54 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Uh, is that all the in their lives for the the year maximum maximum?
[54 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yes, the options are six months, one year, two years or five years. Six months being the shortest is the cheapest. No.
[54 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, so basically that means, uh, every if, if he chooses that six months, that means you can make a payment every six months if he claims or if he chooses money, you can only claim every year.
[55 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So what that means, what the benefit. Means is he has a six month benefit. When he makes a claim on the policy. The maximum amount of time that he will pay that claim to him will either be until he returns to work and his income again, or until the six month benefit. Finishes whichever comes first between the two. It'll be yeah, whichever comes first between when he goes back to work or if six months is his benefit period until that six months finishes from the claim. OK.
[55 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : OK, so you can, you can continue paying we uh, monthly for six months if he chooses 6 months or for one year if he chooses one year, or for two years and five years, Yeah, or until he goes back to work, whichever comes, you know?
[56 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : MM hmm. Oh, it's not about. Mm. Hmm. Yeah, I'll give him. No, I'll give him.
[56 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't know the policy Apostle and I according to the graphic in apostle you might talk to the prima told me 3 - 50. The other is a break. Pardon.
