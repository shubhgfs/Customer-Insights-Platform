[3 seconds][Agent] : Good afternoon mate. It's Ken from Rail Insurance. We've received your expression of interest online with regards to income protection insurance. Thanks for making the enquiry. I'm following up on that. I'll explain on my purchase. By the way, some pricing, any questions let me know. Just want to confirm I'm through with Meat or Orzer. Uh huh. Thank you. Thank you. And can I just get to confirm your date of birth? Thank you. And calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general nature not visible to your situation. Also confirming that you're a female and an Australian resident.
[1 seconds][Customer] : Hello, yes, 7/1/88, yes.
[39 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. What's bothered you to look into income protection?
[44 seconds][Customer] : Well, I do already have but I am just looking to explore more options.
[51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no. All good. Appreciate that. Just have a look and see what's kind of out there. Was there anything that kind of sparked that interest, I mean, because you already have income protection.
[51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, I'm just browsing through.
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, all good. That's all right. And I'll explain a little bit more about the income protection, but if you are replacing an existing policy, we recommend, you know, cancel it. And if the application's been approved and you have reviewed this policy before, it may not be identical to your existing company. You should also consider the benefits that may not apply or waiting periods that may start again. So because you already have the account protection need, this provides a monthly income benefit paid directly to you. If you're unable to work due to the saving sickness injury and you suffer a loss of income, it's designed to help cut your bills and moving costs if your salary is interrupted. You can buy if you work at least 15 hours per week in paid employment. Now, what do you do for a living then? All right, lovely.
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : I'm a finance manager about 10 years now.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : How long you been in that profession for All right, all good, so go on. Well, so you've been out and lost your working life. So we'll get to know your role as a finance manager a little bit later when we do the duty space assessment to get that price for you. We offer an income benefit up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. It's easy to apply. We ask you some health and livestock questions over the phone to see if you're approved and if so, on what terms. We can offer cover and once in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary follows during your 65th birthday. Keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS and you you would already know that premiums for E term protection are generally tax deductible which can make it even more cost effective for you. Now do you have any questions for me so far?
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No, not at this stage.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's all right. We'll hang on to having a look at some pricing in time protection. Was it to cover anything specifically? I mean, are you, is it, are you paying off a mortgage at the moment or is it more so just to help with that and eight expenses?
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm paying off a mortgage.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, no, that's fine. So, yeah, so it's more you can pretty much once you receive this part, it's up to you what you do with that money, whether it's after mortgage or just everyday expenses, completely up to you. OK. So about the duty space assessment, before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Father, to do so could impact your cover at client's time. Do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yes, Yes.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Is your role with administrative, managerial, professional nature? We spend the majority of your time indoors in our office or clinical environment.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, I didn't get your question. Could you repeat that?
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no worries. Of course, it is your role of an administrative, managerial, professional nature. We spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's indoors.

[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : No, no.

What's your annual pre tax income?
[4 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Employed 143. Yep.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : MM Hmm 143 thousand. And based on your duties and your income, you can select a monthly benefit amount from $1000 up to the maximum monthly benefit amount of $8341.00. That's the range that you can select from.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : The maximum?
[5 minutes][Agent] : But what amount would you like me to quote on the maximum?
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : 8341 and a couple of things. The waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable. After the short event you can choose 30 days or 90 days. Keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. Meaning if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Which waiting period would you like me to select? 30 days? Thank you. And the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. Your options need a six months, one year, 2 year or five year benefit. Which benefit.

So the next step would be to take you through these health and lifestyle questions as the price and any terms of cover is determined on the outcome of these questions, which I'll take you through now.
