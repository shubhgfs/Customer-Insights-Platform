But so I can best assist, what has prompted you to start having a look into income protection?
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep, just trying personal Peace of Mind mate. Just working for myself now after last 18 months so I thought I should probably cover myself a bit.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Alright and well, congratulations working for yourself. What are you doing?
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : I've got a landscaping business. I'm mainly pension contractor, but yeah, I have a landscaping business.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And being self-employed, that'd mean that you don't have any sort of workers comp because something happened, is that right?
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's correct.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Right. That's exactly what the income protections designed for us to make sure that there is a monthly income benefit which is paid directly to you. If you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury, suffer a loss of income, of course. Would you say it is more so there to help with your essentials, things like bills, living costs and whatnot while your salary is interrupted? So for example, Damian, do you have a mortgage? Are you renting at the moment? Renting, you and me both. And umm, obviously you'd have your business expenses to worry about.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Renting, right? Yep.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Umm, do you have any dependents, any children living at home with you? Perfect. And then then obviously you have your normal monthlies as well, your groceries. Everyone's got a wheat and you don't want your electric and your water going off anything like that.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Was there anything else each month? Damian? You're worried about having covered though if you're not working.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : What's that? Sorry, mate.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Oh, is there anything else each month you're worried about being able to pay for if you're not working?
[3 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No, just the the standard stuff mate.
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Alright, too easy. Well, in order to sort of cover those essentials, you do let you choose your amount that's anywhere from 1000 up to 15,000 per month, just subject to it being up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income. Then once it's in place, it'll cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. And just keep in mind as well, but there are some exclusions that applies outlined in the PDS. But Daniel, what we do from here is just go through some questions of what you do for work as well as your health and lifestyle. So we can load up an accurate price in terms and conditions for this policy.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yeah. All pretty straightforward, mate.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : But before we go through that, is there any questions for me so far or sounding pretty straightforward, perfect. And of course, before answering any of your questions, it's important you're aware of your duty. Dan, all our questions accurately. Honestly, failure to do so, it could impact your cover claims time, but it just firstly asks, do you work 15 hours or more per week? You're all of an administrative, managerial or professional nature.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, mainly outdoors, mate, Yeah.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : We spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment, then to perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or driver vehicle and the qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : What's that?
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Are you qualified, skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role? Do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation. Is a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry? Air Force, army, armed forces? Or do you handle explosives? And do you regularly work underground or underwater? Work at heights above 10 metres, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul? Be a very interesting landscaping business though. But Damien, have you had any cigarettes in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, Yes, No, no, no, mate.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And are you currently employed or self-employed? So you said you're self-employed.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Nothing good.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So pre tax income, it's your share of annual income earned in the business before taxed directly due to your own personal efforts, plus any business expenses and excluding super contributions. So this is the amount that the business will otherwise cease earning even you're unable to work due to a disability. So Damien, with that in mind, what is your annual pre tax income?
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : I'd probably be around 75 to 80,000, yeah, yeah, be around that. I'm just sort of waking it out this year because last year I was there a bit less, but I went through all my invoice to Jeff and skipping at about 60,000 or just under 60,000 at the moment for the year.
[6 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So be minimum 75,000, OK.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : And then obviously minus materials and that so, so it'd be around the 75 to 80,000.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Oh, so yeah. So you would be sitting at about 80,000 + 75,000 based on what you're earning at the moment, right? So based on your duties and income, you can select the monthly benefit amount from 1000 up to 4375 per month. So then you do be able to cover those essentials, your rent, your business expenses and just sort of the monthly bills. What would you like to be covered for?
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, probably. What about 3 1/2? Three and a half thousand?
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Too easy, I'll set it on the 3500 And then the other two things you get to choose on your policy game. You know your waiting period and benefit. So firstly, the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. So that you're allowed to choose 30 days or 90 days. Just please keep in mind income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. So Damien, which waiting period would you like me to select the 30 of the 90 day?
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So when, so when that kicks in, does that so that well, obviously the if I choose the 30 days, then I won't receive anything for those 30 days and it kicks in after that or.
[7 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Oh yes. So you'd be alleged. So your claim would be eligible after, Yeah, 30 days after you disabled your sickness or entry. And then it is paid monthly in arrears. So generally your first payment be 60 days after your first eligible to claim with the 30 day waiting period.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll go 30 days, mate.
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. And then lastly, the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefit for anyone entry or illness so that you can choose six months, one year, two years or five years. So Damian, which benefit.
[8 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Probably just five years, mate.
[8 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Would you like to select five years? Alright, perfect. And now that we have that all selected, the next step from here is to go through the health and lifestyle portion of the questions. Make sure one, that you're eligible and two, determine your final pricing and what terms and conditions we can offer cover for you. But once again, before we hop into that, I wanted to check in. Is there any questions for me so far or still sounding almost straightforward?
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : No, all good mate.

[20 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. We'll get you finally outcome loaded. And just while that loads, I'll let you know. Of course, included in your policy is a rehabilitation benefit along with the final expenses benefit, which pays $10,000 and you sent your pass way to assist with funeral costs or any other final expenses as well.
[20 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[20 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Umm bits Damien, I'm very happy to let you know today that your application for the income protection has been approved with the low terms. Umm, so exclusions. This is due to disclosure of the mental health one episode. No benefit would be payable for any disability, condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to arising from mental health disorder, illness, stress, trouble, alcohol abuse and then just due to your disclosure that your business would continue to generate income after 60 days. So if employee business continuity, the income protection benefit will be reduced by any income you receive or are entitled to receive from any business you have an interest in subsequent to the stablement date. This adjustment will only apply where the total amount of the benefit payable plus the ongoing income exceeds 70% of your pre disability income. Good Damien, today's for the what you've been approved for the 3500 a month of income protection with a waiting period of 30 days and a benefit period of five years. That's coming in for you at $64.18 per fortnight, so just over $32 a week.
[21 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[21 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So there was nothing within the application that did affect your pricing, which is great, of course.
[21 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Well, that with that question of generating income. So I've said yes. Well, I've said to generate income. If I got injured, I'd probably I'd still be able to get work, but I'd have to hire someone else from and work for us to get this, get everything done. So I've said yes. I'm no for that.
[22 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK. Well in terms of this one, the IT does specify in that exclusion that this adjustment will only apply where the total amount of the benefit payable plus the ongoing income exceeds 70% of your pre disability income. So it is only if you're still personally bringing in more than 70% of your pre disability income or or if what you're bringing in umm plus what you'd be earning from the income protection is more than 70%. So say you're earning still about 30% of your pre disability income, then the income protection would adjust accordingly to capital at 70. Umm. But in terms of this one, of course your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each years your age. But as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year would be $66.71 per fortnight.
[22 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Alright, alright, Yep.
[23 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : And of course, you can also find information about our premium structure on our site. Just keep in mind as well that premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible, which can make it even more cost effective for you. So Damian, when the time comes to prepare your tax return and the financial year statement will automatically be posted to in July of that new financial year so that you can provide that for your tax representative as well. But Damien, for the 3500 a month of income protection to be able to help you cover those essentials, your rents, your business expenses, sort of just any other monthly bills, $64.18 per fortnight. Damien, did you feel that would be affordable and suitable for you?
[23 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that should be fine mate.
[23 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, very glad to hear. Well, you're saying that's any affordable and suitable? We've managed to have you approved for this cover. What we're able to do now is help provide you with some immediate cover and of course send out all the documentation for this policy for you as well. So the great thing is that even though you're covered from the end of the phone call today, Damian, we don't require upfront payment. We actually get to ask you, would you prefer to have your first fortnightly payment come out?
[24 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Am I able to pay for the for the year?
[24 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, We can do it yearly if you'd prefer. That's fine. Whether you do what nightly, monthly or yearly, it ends up being the same amount by the end of the year each way. But would you prefer to do just the whole year?
[24 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Well, I just yeah, yeah, I prefer to the whole year, mate. I hate having hate having deposits coming out of my account throughout the year. I'd rather just have it sorted.
