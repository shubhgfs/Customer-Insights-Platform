[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : No, not a problem. I'm just getting these on and you would have heard this when you called in but please not all our calls are recorded so any advice provided is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. Now, before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly.

[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : No self-employed.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Now to help determine how much cover we can offer or provide you with the definition of pre tax income. So pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. So this is the amount that the business would otherwise seize earning in the event you are unable to work due to a disability. So David, what is your annual pre tax income?
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : I have no idea, but that does that really matter? I just want the smallest policy I can. So what do I say? The lowest.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's, Yep, that's right. Yeah, not a problem. So if you're not too sure, then we offer income benefit from $1000 being the minimum up to $15,000.

[5 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Is that, is that right? Sorry.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Just bear with me now with the waiting periods and the benefit. So you have the option to select different waiting periods and benefit periods depending on your circumstances. So the waiting period is a non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. Now you can choose 30 days or 90 days.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : 90 days.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Please keep in mind that you Yep, not a problem. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in a raise. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. So we'll do the 90 day waiting period. Just bringing this up, sorry I might be long. Sorry, I'm not getting off. And then now with the benefit. The benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So you have four options. There's six months, one year, two years or five years. So if you're looking at the lowest, did you want to look the the six months is the lowest did you want?
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : The one year, 06 months, yeah, that'll do.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, six months is the lowest. Yeah. Alright. So we'll carry. Sorry. I'm just trying to put in the 1000. OK, I'm sorry. So I'm just gonna have to place you on hold for a second. So I'm just trying to put in the 1000. It's just not yet allowing me to do that just for some reason. So it's just give me two seconds. I'll just try to work it out.
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Alright, no worries.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Thanks. Thank you for holding David. I'm terribly sorry for making a hold.
[11 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep, fine.
[11 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Umm OK so I just had to double check. So for some reason it wasn't letting me put $1000 in. So I just want to confirm. I just had to speak to a manager and see umm if we could do that. So can I just confirm your annual pre tax income is at least now $17,200? Is that right? OK, perfect. Thank you. So we're able to do the $1000 monthly benefit amount now we are doing the 90 day waiting period and you're happy with the six months and the minimum?
[11 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep.
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, the minimum benefit. OK. Now from here, it's probably a little bit different to when you did the income protection last time. We actually go through health and lifestyle questions. The price and any terms discovery is determined on the outcome of these questions.
