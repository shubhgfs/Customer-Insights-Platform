[2 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : That, that, that is correct.
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, I, I, I can just recap all of those benefits and features and explain how it will work for you. And that way, yeah, you've got all of that information now your did you have a preferred name as well?
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Nemo, Yeah. Nemo, Nemo.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : MMM, yeah. Beautiful, beautiful Nemo. Thank you. So Nemo, just in regards to the income protection, so and let me just quickly recap everything. So we will actually pay you a monthly benefit. If you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income, we can offer a benefit up to 70% of the your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : It will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. And keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS with the premiums. They are generally tax deductible for the income protection. So, yeah, have a chat to your, your tax agent there and perfect. So, and I'll just reconfirm some details. So, you know, have you had a, or has anything with your duties based assessments? Has, umm, anything changed in the past 30 days or do you work less than 15 hours per week? Beautiful. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes][Customer] : No, no, no, don't smoke. No.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, perfect. Always just a recapping. Thank you. And can I also confirm are you currently employed or self-employed?
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that sounds like.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : self-employed, beautiful. And again just to recap that the pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts. Yes, any business expenses and excluding super contributions, this is the amount that the business would otherwise cease earning in the event you were unable to work due to a disability. So can I just get you to recap again, ma'am? Nemo, what is your annual pre tax income?
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : That's 150.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yep, beautiful. So $150,000 as the annual income before the tax is taken out and based on your duties that you previously went through, which has not changed and income, you can select a monthly benefit amount from the $1000 up to the $8750 which you have selected for yourself. And we'll keep Yeah, beautiful. We'll keep that top cover. So with the waiting period, so you have selected 30 days and this is where we're at. So Nina, your question was what happened? So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable. After the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. So you have selected the 30 days, but does that make sense or would you like me to give you an example?
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, absolutely. I understand. I understand.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And what is the benefit amount? So the benefit amount or benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefits for anyone injury or illness. And yes, you have selected the six months benefit. You're still happy with the six months benefit.
[6 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So again, in regards to all the questions you went through, you know, has anything changed since going through those soft and lifestyle questions there?

Oh, sorry, your COVID-19 infection in the last 30 days.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you. And any questions in regards to just me re explaining everything. I I'll also explain. There is also a rehabilitation benefit along with the final expenses benefit which pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away. And Yep.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : None.
