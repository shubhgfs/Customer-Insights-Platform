[4 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[5 seconds][Agent] : Hi there, Edward. My name's Sharon. I'm giving a call from Real Insurance. How are you? No, that's good, mate. Yeah, not too bad. But look, just following up on the quote request that we've received for the income protection insurance this morning.
[17 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[17 seconds][Agent] : So essentially I'm just here to take you through how it works, go through some different terms and prices, see if we can find something that works for you there as well.
[24 seconds][Customer] : Perfect.
[25 seconds][Agent] : OK, wonderful. What I'll need to do first, mate. Just to let you know, our calls are recorded and any advice I provide is generally nature and may not be suitable to your situation. I'll just make sure I've got your details correct here too. I've got your name down as Edward Malloy.
[38 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Correct.
[38 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. I saw your e-mail as well, mate. Do you prefer Eddie? Is that all right?
[42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's fine. Yep.
[42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK. Look, I don't want to make it seem like you're in trouble. Of course. And then I've got your date of birth here as well, the 12th of January 1982.
[50 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[50 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Perfect. And lastly, just confirming that you are a male and Australian resident.
[54 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Correct.
[55 seconds][Agent] : OK, wonderful. That's everything out of the way. I appreciate going through that as well mate. What's got you looking into the income protection insurance recently?
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : I need it for a job.
[1 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha. Oh, sorry, requirement for what do you do for work?
[1 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : I know.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Hey there, gotcha.
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : How long you been doing that? For 20 years?
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : You say gotcha too long, but I'm sure you enjoyed of course saying it for that long there. And I imagine that you've got an upcoming role. It's just one of those requirements. You need income protection there.
[1 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha. Look, we should be able to get that sorted for you there. It's a fairly straightforward process and shouldn't take us too long. If it all works that beneficial. We can have you covered as today. Policy documents on their way as well without charging of course on the same day. But yeah, this is essentially what we go through. I'll do a little bit of explaining how it works. We then go through a duties based assessment. So it's, rather than going off a job title, bit more personal to your requirements. And then from there you get to pick your own terms of cover, the amounts, everything. And then we'll jump through a quick application. So what we can work out for you now, have you held this in the past or is it sort of all relatively new for you? Easy though. Look, it's not a worry. If you've got any questions as well, please jump in, let me know. I'd be more than happy to clarify for you too. Now the main way it's being designed it is to provide a monthly income benefit that's paid directly to you if you are unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you do suffer a loss of income. So essentially there to, you know, help cover bills and living costs of your salaries being interrupted. But obviously this is going to help you obviously the upcoming role there too. Now what we offer is an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income. So starting from $1000 up to a maximum of 15,000 per month. It will be salary dependent, but our system calculates it anyway, so won't be a worry. Now as I mentioned, very straightforward application. So we just go through a series of health and lifestyle questions over the phone to check your eligibility and approval and if so, on what terms we can actually offer the cover. Now, if you're happy with it all, you pop that in place, it then protects you until your policy anniversary, until you're following your 65th birthday there. OK, beautiful. And now as well, keep in mind there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS, but nothing I think you should have to worry about. It's more so just engaging in like war or criminal activity. So hopefully nothing across the weekend of sorts. Neil, a bit of a heads up as well, just looking into the future to save you a bit of penny there. The premiums for income protection, they are generally tax deductible. So it can even make it even more cost effective if you dare too.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK, cool. Perfect.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Now that's essentially the crux of the policy. We'll learn a bit more as we do go through. But so far, Eddie, how's that sounding for you there?
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, good, good.
[3 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. Let's have a look here. So we'll go through the duties based. It shouldn't take us like 30 seconds. Maybe they are all just yes or no responses and I'll just need to let you know before entering any of that questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all of them accurately and honestly. Just sorry as value to do so could impact your cover at claims time. All right. Now, first questions, just confirming. Do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment?
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : No.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : No. And do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle?
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Well, I've got it out of work and that's about it.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : No. So if it's more so like commuting to work and whatnot, that's not classified, it's only under like a commercial vehicle.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, but Oh no, no.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, that perfect. All right. And I imagine I know the answer to this one already. Are you qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role? Yeah.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yes, alright, Sir.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : You've asked us after 20 years, so of course, yeah. Now the next one here is just double checking. Do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot of crew entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces or do you handle explosives? No, thank goodness. And do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights above 10 metres, work offshore or carry a firearm?
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I do work at the club there maybe sometime. So that's about it.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK with this one because it's only more so if it's like regularly old. Our definition for it says a consistent pattern at regular time intervals. So example daily or like at least three times per week. No, so it's just more of an on the odd occasion.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no, no, Yep, that's another one.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, No, all good. Perfect. We'll pop down a no there and that's the duties based done. That means we can move through to the sort of quoting screen here now just because it doesn't transfer from online demo. I quickly just have to reconfirm. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Look, it's alright. I'm guilty as well. I mean it's a very bad habit. I think we both know, but one that's a bit hard to shake off at the same time.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, I get it.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Now the next thing we're gonna determine is the maximum monthly benefit amount that we can provide you so that it'll just give us our range from 1000 up to whatever we do that based off of your annual income before tax. Now I presume you'd be self-employed there, correct?
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Correct.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK. What will classify as your pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts lessening business expenses and excluding super contributions. So it's essentially the amount the business would otherwise cease earning in the event you were unable to work due to a disability. What would you say your annual income before tax would be?
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Between 80 to 80 to 100. That's fine.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, we can pop down if it's kind of between those two figures there. Can we pop down 90,000? Happy with that.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's fine.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. Having a look there. So as I mentioned, minimum $1000, it goes up in $100 increments all the way up to a maximum of $5250 for the monthly benefit. Where did you want to have a look first, Eddie?
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that's fine.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Just the maximum.
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna ask to fix that. That's fine. I would.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Sorry.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. That that that number's fine.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, no, perfect. We'll have a look there just because of course it is limited to up to 70% of the Oh yeah, pre tax income. So having a look there, the next thing we'll have to choose would be the waiting period. So this is essentially just a non payment period that you must serve before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. Now we give you the option of either 30 days or 90 days. And just to keep in mind, the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So as an example, if you chose a 30 day waiting period, the first payment would be 60 days from when you were first eligible to claim. Now between 30 or 90, which did you want to have a look at first? Dirty, easy done. And lastly, the benefit. This is just the maximum amount of time, but we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : 3030 Oh cheese.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : The options here are six months, one year, two years, or five years, please. Beautiful two. OK, yeah. The next step, Eddie, is to run you through the health and master questions. As I said, the price in any terms of the cover, they will be determined on the outcome and it shouldn't take us too long anyway, generally in a couple of minutes. And what I'll have to do, just make sure I've got your other contact details correct here. I've just got your e-mail. It was Eddie Malloy with an extra Y at theend@gmail.com.
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep, correct.
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And in case you do get approved, we also like to have an address down so we can get policy documents actually that way as well. What would be your post code there, man? 7/2 And was that in Lexham or so beautiful? And then lastly, just the street number and street name for you.
[8 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : 2572 Derby 78 Java Street Derby.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : The street, there we go. Perfect. And that's the same as your postal address.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep, correct.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah Biddy. OK, that's everything there and just need to read out the pre underwriting disclosure. It is just a short statement that makes you aware of your responsibility. Of course, before answering the questions. From there we can jump straight into it. So it just says here.

[9 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. Now these questions as well, mate, very, very straightforward. I'll just need to make sure I read that in full first. I'll just ask yes or no, respond accordingly. We should be able to fly right through today. So starting off, first one's double checking.

No, And have you ever been declared bankrupt or placed in receivership, in voluntary liquidation or under administration? No. Beautiful. OK, now just on to the straight health questions here. The next one's just in relation to your height and weight. So in order to move forward with the application, we just need to make sure we've got a confident single figure measurement for each one. Starting off first, either centimetres or 15 inches will be fine.
[10 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No, Yes, No, no, no 186. 104 kilos.

Keep in mind though too, with this insurance, Eddie, it does cover you worldwide 24/7. Knock on wood, something's to happen on holiday outside of the country that now this next one here is just double checking. Do you have existing income protection cover? Yes or no?
[11 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no.

[14 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : No Beautiful look. Very good so far there. That's the biggest section out of the way. I appreciate it there. We're almost done. This next one's just confirming. Other than what you've already told me about, it's anything new that we haven't covered yet. In the past three years, have you sought medical advice or treatment by a medical practitioner or specialist? Or are you awaiting results for any medical tests or investigations such as, but not limited to any surgeries, X-rays, scans, blood tests or biopsy? Yes or no? Beautiful.

[15 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, Oh no beauty. No, no, all good mate, very good there. And the last question, this is just how much of ADWR it's just asking.

Motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, AB sailing, scuba diving deeper than 40 metres, cave or wreck diving or any other hazardous activity. Yes or no?
[15 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : No.
[15 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Hi, thank goodness. They sound fun, don't get me wrong, but too, too dangerous in my opinion.
[15 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah.
[15 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : All righty, that's just going to load up with the outcome there. I'll let you know that it's looking good so far. Anyway, you pretty much need to know everything. Now, just while that loads up, I'll let you know. There are some other things that are included in this policy as well, Eddie. So there is a rehabilitation benefit along with a final expenses benefit. And what the final expenses does is it actually pays you $10,000 in the event you've got to pass away while holding this policy to a beneficiary or beneficiaries of your choice. The easiest way to put it, it's just an in built funeral insurance that we include within the income protection there.
[16 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK. Thank you.
[16 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. I'm not too sure if you've got something like that in place, but I've got a 2IN1 here and let's have a look back over here. Yeah, beautiful. Just as I thought there matters so very big. Congratulations. The application has been approved just with one below term, which is actually really good if I say so myself. It's just one exclusion that's popped up and it says here self-employed business continuity. So it says the the income protection benefit will be reduced by any income you receive or are entitled to receive from any business you have an interest in subsequent to the disablement date. This adjustment will only apply where the total amount of the benefit payable plus the ongoing income exceeds 70% of your pre disability income there. OK, beautiful. Otherwise in terms of your health, as I said mate, password, flying colours. So no very, very good stuff there. The one final thing we'll go through now, obviously the prices and terms, we can have a little bit of a play around with the figures as well. Find something that works best for you. So as a recap, monthly benefit of $5250, waiting period of 30 days and a benefit period of two years, you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $83.89. How's that sound for you there?
[17 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, good.
[17 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. Now the one thing I do just want to make you aware of as well, mate, is just how the premiums work long term, of course. But look, with this policy, obviously you can hold it for as short as you need. If it's just for that contract that's coming up there, If you want to cancel it, you're not into it after that's all done. But if you do want to keep it in place as well, obviously you've got up until the policy after your 65th policy anniversary after your 65th birthday there. But just to give a heads up, at the moment the premiums, they are skipped just meaning that they will generally increase each year as you age. And as an indication, if you made no changes to the cover, left everything the same, next year just works out to be $88.36 a fortnight for you there, OK. But keep in mind we send out a notice about a month before your policy anniversary anyway. So it gives you had that much closer to the date and what those price changes would be before they actually happen. So if you need to give us a call, you can. And you can also find more information about our premium structure on our website. Beautiful. Now that's everything there. What we normally do next, Eddie, obviously, we give you enough time to review all the information. As I said, we can get the policy documents out to you to get them via e-mail in about the next hour or so or even within the hour. And all the physical papers take about two to five business days to appear. But that's the full documentation for you. We can also get you covered as of today. But as I mentioned, you don't have to pay for it upfront. Of course, we allow our customers to pick their first payment date within the next 30 days. So you can push it as far as you need. And then whatever day you choose, you get a 30 day calling off. After that's done as well.
[18 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, yeah, cool.
[19 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, easy done. We're moving through there. We've already confirmed the contacts. That's great. Oh, the only other thing. I'll just make sure your best contact number, mate. That was the mobile one at the moment, ending in 207.
[19 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yep, correct.
[19 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK, easy done now. Happy to work around whatever schedule you may have on the instant sort of budget you've got in mind there in the next coming days or weeks. Eddie, when did you want to pick the first collection day?
[19 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : I won't ever.
[19 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, look, I just can't pick a day myself. That's completely up to you. I can pop it any day next week or the week after, whatever you'd like.
[19 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : My bus next Friday, Friday earlier.
[19 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Next Friday, 18th, easy done. OK. And then, yeah, it's just every fortnight on the Friday there. And in the last two steps I've got today, I will need to read out the final and verbal declaration, which shouldn't take me too long. But we do need to note down the preferred method of payment to make sure when the 18th rolls around, the insurance is up to date then. So we've two options we've got is either a direct debit from a BSBN account number or you can use a card, which was easier today.
[19 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll just need the card.
[20 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Just a card, easy done. Let me swap that over there. All righty now, just for security purposes, while obtaining your card details, the call recording will stop and we'll recommend after we have collected your details there. The about reading anything else out, that's all good. I'll just exit the gateway now. And please be advised that the call recording has now resumed for quality and monitoring purposes. So final step going through the declaration there, Eddie, I'll just double check. Any other questions for me at the moment?
[21 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[21 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : No easy done. Awesome. We'll get through this and I'll let you know. I can give you the policy number obviously once we've arranged it today if you want to jot it down. Otherwise you'll get it in the e-mail anyway in about an hour or so.
[21 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Perfect.
[21 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, easy.
[21 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[21 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So just says here thank you Edward Malloy, it is important you understand the following information.
