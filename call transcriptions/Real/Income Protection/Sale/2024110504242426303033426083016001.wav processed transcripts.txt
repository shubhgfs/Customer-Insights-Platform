[7 seconds][Agent] : How you doing today?
[8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Good yourself.
[10 seconds][Agent] : Thank you Sir. And I was bringing you back from earlier today just in regards to the income protection.

[24 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Kelly Bosch in there in 080878.
[27 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much once again, because I recorded. Any advice I provide is general nature and they're not suitable for the situation. How did everything go with your accountants or tax person?
[37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. I found out pretty much everything I needed. No. So yeah.
[40 seconds][Agent] : OK, thank you. So I'll go through the product details with you again. So there we are. OK. All right. Yeah.
[54 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[51 seconds][Agent] : So you're for your age, you're currently 46 and you're a male Australian resident.
[56 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[57 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. All right, OK. Umm, yeah. So I know you went through the, uh, the few quotes already last week, and now that you've got the answer you're looking for, how much were you? Like, what was it that you want to adjust, actually?
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : So I was looking at how much cover I actually needed. So I am going to need the larger amount, $14,000 I needed to get another quote for the benefit. Because I've only five years.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, Of course, yeah, OK, Yeah, yeah. And I think that'll adjust the premiums to be lower as well.
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : I was going to bring that down to 2 and then Yep.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, yeah. So I'll go through that, umm, before you, umm, there. So we, umm, compare so with the income protection. Yep. So we compared directly with uh, uh, two providers. So that's real insurance and also guiding insurance. So we're looking at real insurance as the, uh, quotation with that provider.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Umm, bearing in mind, again, we don't compare all aspects or products available in the market. We are a related company to, uh, Greenstone, a financial services who distribute and administer the brands I can arrange today. So each product has different features. So it is important to consider this in combination with the price and also the PDS before making a decision of purchase. So with the duty based questions again, that I know you have already answered it with my colleague last week, uh, but because I'm go, I'm going, I'm adjusting the actual quotes for you. I'll go through those questions with you again. So, uh, before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all of our questions accurately. And also honestly, failure to do this could, uh, failure to do so could impact your cover at claims times. So first question again, do you work 15 hours or more per week? Thank you.
[3 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yes.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Umm, is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment OK? Are you required to perform any physical duties?

[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, do you work in any of the following fields, aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces, or do you carry a firearm or handle explosives? Thank you. So that completes the duty based assessment. Thanks for going through that with me again. And the next one asks you, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Thank you. Yep. And are you currently employed or self-employed there?
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I employed.
[4 minutes][Agent] : Kelly, Thank you. And with your pre tax income, that is the total annual in, so that is it. So pre tax income is the total annual remuneration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses, excluding super contributions. I think from the umm, previous quote you, you've mentioned, uh, you put through 240,000 is that right?
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's correct.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, yeah. And would that be still the same?
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yep.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK. So 240000. OK Yep. Now, based on your duties and also income, you can select a monthly benefit amount anywhere from uh, $1000.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : That's the minimum and it ranges all the way up to uh, $14,000, which is the maximum benefits. Yeah. So confirming that you're looking at the maximum benefit 14,000.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And, uh, the waiting period on the cover, which is either 30 days or 90 days, that's the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. Uh, you can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So which waiting period were you more leaning towards the Kelly? Thank you. Yeah. And with the benefit.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : The 30 day one, Yep.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : That's the maximum amount of time that we'll pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So which umm, for a period? What are you looking at?
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : So you've me you've given me a quote for the five year.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yep, correct.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : I want the one for a two year for the two year.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. OK, so I brought it down from 5 years to two years. That's essentially 60 months down to 24 months. So with real insurance, if you're accepted with no further changes, which we'll go through shortly, 490 premium is 12947 per fortnight.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And they also provide you with a real reward. So once you've heard the cover in place for the 1st 12 months, they'll refund you back 10% of your premiums you paid. So based off that, uh, premium provided no change to it following your first policy anniversary date, you received back $336.62 back into your account. Yeah, thank you. And, umm, how the covers, uh, provided to you. It's, it is paid directly to you, the monthly income benefit if you are unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income.

[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, take care.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So the income benefit could range uh, of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income. So it could be from $1000 up to a maximum of uh, 15,000. So once in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, take care.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : All right, All sounds good.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Umm, did you have any questions for me so far there, Kelly, before we go through the UMM, OK, thank you. And also included within the policy to provide you with more value as well. Umm, so this is at no additional cost. It all comes included with the quote that I've provided so far. You have a rehabilitation benefit as long a, a along with a final expenses benefit which pays out $10,000 in the event you pass away to your beneficiaries to assist them with the cost associated with your funeral. Yeah, thank you. And uh, your premium is stepped, which means, uh, it will, uh, so your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase HG as your age.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : OK, it's OK.
[8 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, and to show you that indication again, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be 136 nineteen per fortnight.

[8 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : So I think the end of the policy.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, at the end of each policy anniversary date, Yeah. So, and so when you, when you renew your cover every year, that's when it would be assessed on.
