[19 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[19 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So I'm just going to remind you your cover is approved with the below term. So in relation to your answers provided regarding mental health, one episode, no benefit would be payable for any disability, condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to or arriving from mental health disorder or illness, stress, drug or alcohol abuse. But the great news is you've been fully approved for the cover. So what we'll do now is we'll take you through some different options for pricing. Now we've got plenty of different ways we can a can adjust this quote, so let me know how it sounds and we can go from there. But for the monthly benefit amount of $15,000 with a 30 day waiting period and a five year benefit. You'd be looking at a fortnightly premium of $146.64 per fortnight.
[20 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, Yep. OK.
[20 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So does that one there sound like it would be affordable or did you want to look at any other amounts?
[20 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, definitely look at all options.
[20 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, not a problem. So if we were to. So is there a way you want to look at adjusting that premium? So did you want to look at like a different waiting period or benefit. Or.
[20 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Just I'm assuming that you're looking at waiting periods and all the other different pieces and that will give you a variation of the opinion on the shoe.
[20 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Exactly. So JJ, just to give you an idea, if you were to look at the 90 day waiting period and keeping everything else the same with that $15,000 benefit and the five year benefit. It would be $97.34 a fortnight.
[21 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK. Sorry. What was that one again? What was the period?
[21 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : That's for the 90 day waiting period still with the five year benefit.
[21 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, yeah.
[21 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : And the $15,000 benefit amount?
[21 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK. Oh no, yeah, that seems doable. Yeah, definitely.
[21 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : That one sounds a little bit more suitable at this stage.
[21 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, definitely.
[21 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : No problem. Now, one thing I also wanted to ask, I will let you know of, I should say is with this policy, there is a rehabilitation benefit. So you're also there's a final expenses benefit which pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away to assist with things like your funeral costs or other final expenses policy. Your premium is obviously stepped, which means it will generally increase each your age. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website. But as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $100.52 per fortnight, so approximately just over a $3 increase next year.
[21 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. Right.
[22 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : And we do still have our rewards. So following your first policy anniversary that we will refund you 10% of premiums you've paid in that time.
[22 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no worries. OK.
[22 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So on this one here, you'd be looking at getting $253.08 back from us after the first year now. Now the great thing about us here at Wheel Insurance, now that you've been fully approved for the cover, it does actually allow us to get you covered over the phone today. What that would mean though is that we get the proper policy documentation sent out for you to sit down, have a good read through it and make sure obviously happy with everything to do with the cover so you don't have to pay anything until the day you choose. If you do end up looking through it all and you change your mind for any reason, that's perfectly fine. There's no cancellation fees, you're not logged into this and you do actually have a 30 day cooling off. So if you cancel within that 30 days you get a full refund of any premiums you may have paid. Unless of course a claim has been made. But I'll just confirm a couple more details. I've got your contact number, I called you on today, is that your preferred contact number? And we've got the e-mail address b.ittles@bigcond.com, is that correct?
[23 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : It is, yeah, that's correct.
[23 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Alright, beautiful. Now, as I mentioned, even though you would be covered from today, you're still obviously not required to pay anything until the day you choose. What day would you like me to note down for the first payment day? Do you have like a payday or do you want to link it up to the life cover or?
[23 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Probably the yeah. Does the linking up with the life cover, is there any like like benefits by having the life cover plus this or is there any discount?
[24 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So they they are two completely separate policy. So there's no like joint policy discounts or like multi policy discounts, but we can obviously have it still linked up to like the same payday for yourself.
[24 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah. And what payday is it? Sorry for the last, you know.
[24 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : At the moment I California. So I, I don't have a lot of access to existing policies, just being from sales, but I can see your next person is due on Monday the 20th.
[24 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, perfect. I'll just match it with that.
[24 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine. We can do that. And then it'll be every fortnight on a Monday from there.
[24 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[24 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : It's nice and easy though. We do a direct debit. Are we noting down a BSB and account number or Visa or MasterCard?
[24 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Visa.
[24 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no worries. For security reasons, I don't have access to bank details. They do get encrypted in the system, so I can't see your card. But let me know when you've got the card ready. Because also for security reasons, when we note down card details, the call recording will stop and it'll start up again once I've put it through. So you just let me know when you're ready to go so I can stop that recording first.
[25 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm ready to go.
[25 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. I'll just stop that recording now. Bear with me.
[26 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : None.
[26 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : And just letting you know, the call recording has started up again, so all I need to do now is reach you through a declaration and I'll ask for your agreement to the terms at the end. And there's also a question in the middle that I need a yes or no answer for. And this will all be done for you if I do start to read this too fast. If you've got any questions about anything I'm going through, just jump in, let me know. I'll be happy to help you out.
