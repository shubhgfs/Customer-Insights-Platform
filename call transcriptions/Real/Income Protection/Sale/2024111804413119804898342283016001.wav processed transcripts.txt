[12 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, if you don't like to get a paper waiting, but uh yeah, that was the reason for the call. Just following up on your online enquiry to get some quotes for income protection cover. Just umm, yeah, I was going to bring up the quotes and of course I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have as well.
[20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[26 seconds][Agent] : Now just have to let you know that all our calls are recorded. Any advice provided is general nature may not be suitable to your situation. And just to make sure, I do have your details correct in front of me if you please confirm your name and date of birth.
[41 seconds][Customer] : It's Craig Britain at 12th of the 3rd, 1966.
[42 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's the one. Thanks very much. And you are, of course, a male Australian residence, correct? OK Yeah, that's fine. No worries.
[52 seconds][Customer] : Well, I'm in English now on a permanent visa.
[57 seconds][Agent] : OK. Right. So sorry, were you on like a permanent residency visa or is that something different?
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, permanent.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So you're a male and you're a permanent resident living in Australia at the moment. Yeah, that's fine. All good. And, uh, if you don't mind me asking, what's made you look at getting quotes for income protection cover today?
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Oh, just tried to get paid off an invoice and it's now telling me that the do you need income protection? But when we first come back, because we was over here for 15 years and obviously I had income protection and what not.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : And then when we tried to do it, I only, I've only been back about a year and a half and it was so difficult to get it because you're 58 years old.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah, OK. We just don't understand.
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Well, basically, yeah. And I and I have been interested in getting it for a while.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Was this something that you need to like to show to get support for work or you OK?
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : That's the, the older you get, the more you think flipping it. What happens if I, you know, pull up lane or something?
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, right. OK, no, that's fair. Look, uh, either way, I'll bring up some quotes. Umm, just, yeah. While I do that, I'll give you a bit of a rundown on how our policy works and what it covers. It's umm, yeah. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no worries.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : It's sure Let's see the way our cover works. It's very straightforward. So this policy is designed to provide a monthly income benefit that gets paid directly to yourself if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and if you did suffer loss of income. So it is designed to help cover your bills and living costs if your salary is interrupted. Now you can apply if you work at least 15 hours per week in paid employment and we do offer an income benefit up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income. So range from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000 a month. Now the application process is very simple, basically just a few health and lifestyle questions over the phone to see if you are approved and if so, on what terms we can offer cover. Once it is in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Please keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the product disclosure statement and also premiums for the income protection are generally tax deductible as well, just to make that a bit more cost effective come tax time. Now to generate a quote, I'll just have to ask you some questions regarding your duties at work. I mean, they're basically just yes or no questions.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Just to see. Before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your coverage claims time. First one says, do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment?
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Well, I spend a lot of my time indoors on the floor layer.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : All right. OK. Yeah, got you. All right. Well then just to capture the results, keep no for that one, but I'll just clarify by asking, do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle?
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : I drive a vehicle. I don't use heavy machinery or anything really.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Then it just says are you qualified, skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role?
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : I'm skilled.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. And do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew? Entertainment or sporting industry? Air Force, Army, armed forces? Or do you handle explosives? And do you regularly work underground or underwater? Work at heights above 10 meters, Work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul? Perfect. And just to confirm, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yep. Sure. And can I please confirm, are you currently employed or self-employed?
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : No, no, yes, it's self-employed.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So the definition of pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. So this is the amount that the business would otherwise cease earning in the event that you are unable to work due to a disability. Just for the sake of the quote, do you know what your annual income before tax would be?
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : What's me annual income before tax? What was it last year? What was it? I can't remember the account what we had off the top of your head. She's just going to have a look now at what the thing you was in the year.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. No, that's fine. Sure. Right.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : So he's not, like I said, he's not. I work for quite a number of companies, but this is the first time it's happened where they've asked for the income protection.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Mm.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : You asked for the insurances and everything else.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Hmm yeah sure.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : And I'm like, hang on my subcontracts. So why is it thinking to you that I need income protection?
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : MMM OK. I, I think because I, I do speak to a lot of guys in that situation. A lot of people I speak to purely need this just to show uh, to get on certain job sites and that sort of thing.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : See.
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : I'm not sure if it has to do with like work cover, umm, like if the like the the owner of that is providing work cover or not. That's why they require people to have income protection, if that makes sense.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, I see what I mean.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Umm, yeah, I'm not not 100% sure. Yeah. Mm hmm. Yeah.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Because normally it's just if if anything happened, you'd just be out of work, wouldn't you, as a subcontractor, you know, because I never even made a claim. I mean, I think I had it last time I was here for about 15 years. Never made one claim.
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Well, OK. Yeah, I guess that's good. Yes, yeah.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But you're just like, Oh my word. But they'll let me work on site before I put the invoice in.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Right.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : And they never asked me for any of this beforehand.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah. Us.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : And I'm working in a, in a, in a body where they make big trucks and stuff like that.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, right.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : And I thought, man, I couldn't burn the place down. How do you know I've got insurances?
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah, exactly. Yeah. Usually the people told me that they have to show it just to get on the job site, not the other way around. So yeah. Yeah. Mm. Hmm.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, you do normally like say your first thing is when you work for new companies, you throw them all your, all your stuff you need to, you know, and, but this one was completely different. And now I've been waiting about a month and 1/2 for this invoice and I'm like, just just pay it.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, right.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : So I will say what I say.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : What a pain Figures crossed.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : You got it. That's uh, I think it can work out. That's could you? Well, yeah, because I didn't start. So I started. Was it after the tax year? It was on it. I started about October of 23. So I think I earned about 85 grand off the top.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK. OK. Well, just for the sake of the quote, if you like, I can base it on the 85,000 just to give you a figure. We can always come back to that if they'd be.
[7 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : And yeah, yeah, yeah, that'd be cool. I think it was about 85.
[8 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure, OK, sure. Umm, based on your duties and your incomes are based on 85,000 a year, it means I can quote you on the monthly and short amount anywhere from $1000 a month up to a maximum of $4958 a month, which is 70% of your income. Umm, what amount did you want me to start the quote on?
[8 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, that's, that's what I was looking at about 4000 a month or something.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. Well based on the 4000.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : You know, 1000 a week is to cover the, you know, the rent.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, fair enough. Now there's a couple of components to the income protection. So there is a waiting period and a benefit.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So just clarify, the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. So you can choose from either 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So this means if you chose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. Which waiting period would you like me to start the quote on? 30 or the 90 days? Sure. And the benefit. Umm, so this is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefits for anyone, injury or illness. So basically you can choose the length of time you'd like to be covered each time you're unable to work. Umm, so there are four options you can choose from. Why that Six months, one year, two years or five years? Umm, which benefit. Would you like me to start the quote on?
[9 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Ah, the 30 gay one that's *******. It's longer than six months. Shoot me.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Alright, OK, fair. You wanted to start on the six months?
[9 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, please.
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure, no problem. OK, let's say just to give you an example of the figures, if you're looking at a cover of $4000 a month with a waiting period of 30 days and a benefit period of six months, it works out to be a fortnightly premium of $196.42. So that's yeah.
[10 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : 196 so that's yeah, yeah. I mean that that would have to do. Yeah. That'll be sweet.
[10 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, so would that be something that would be suitable at this stage?
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. That'd be cool. That'd be cool.
[10 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, again, sure.
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : 196 a fortnight. Yeah.
[10 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : 49 yeah, that's right.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. 05 grand a year.
[10 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So 196 and $0.42, just a bit of A5 grand for the year for that one, yeah.
[10 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. And that's all tax deductible.
[10 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so the exact yearly figure, umm, so would work out to be exactly, yeah, $5106.85 for the year, yeah. So what happens is that each policy anniversary we do send you out. Oh, sorry to be. No, not the policy anniversary, My apologies.
[10 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Uh, when the end of financial year rolls around, so mid-july, umm, we'll send out a yearly statement, umm, so that you can claim it back on tax.
[10 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Sorry.
[10 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So if you take it to your accountant or if you do yourself, you can just, uh, follow the steps. Yeah, we'll definitely send out a statement each year.
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that's girl.
[11 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. Look, in this situation, if you're liking the sound of that so far, what would you like to do is just quickly go through those health and lifestyle questions just so that we can let you know if you are eligible or if there'd be any changes to those terms and conditions. And that way if you are approved and if you're happy to, I'll organize to send you out all the documentation so that you can take some time to read through it in your own time.
[11 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[11 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Umm, just make sure you're happy with it. Just in case I misspoke earlier. So the premiums, they are generally tax deductible. Umm, so I can't say for certain, like everybody's situation that they would 100% be tax deductible. It is obviously dependent on your personal circumstances. But yeah, with income protection, it is generally tax deductible now. I'm sorry.
[11 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I find that I live in Australia, everyone says, oh, you can claim it back and every time you put it in you don't get the right percentage back.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Uh, yeah, right. OK, yeah, sorry about that.
[11 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : It's like, hang on, I'm paying out 100%, why am I only getting 27% even on calls and stuff like that?
[11 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Oh really? Oh, wow. OK, yeah, I don't know much about tax. I'll be honest. I just do the E tax every year and it pretty much just automatically calculate, calculate it for me because yeah, numbers do my head and it's uh yeah.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I hear you mate.
[12 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Alrighty, OK, alright. Well, uh, the other part to keep in mind is that the premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. Uh, but I've got a premium projection here, so just give an indication of what that looks like. Just to see as an indication. If you make no changes to the policy next year, the fortnightly premium would be $215.24. And you can also find information about our pre.
[12 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : It's going up like, yeah, it's going up like $6 a week or something.
[12 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : I'm sorry, uh, let me give you the exact figure. Yes, it's $215.24 a fortnight so it'd be roughly, uh, yes, say about 9 odd dollars a week. Just wanna increase by next year. Umm, yeah. Basically what happens is roughly 30 days before each policy anniversary, umm, we do send out an updated schedule notifying you of any changes before they happen. So you'll have roughly about a month each year to reevaluate, work out what you want to do.
[12 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[13 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Of course, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. Also including the policy is a rehabilitation benefit along with the final expenses benefit, which pays $10,000 in the event that you would have passed away just to help out with funeral costs or any other final expenses. Now, Craig, just before I do jump into the questions, I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing by you. Is that all making sense for you so far?
[13 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
[13 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, easy. Alrighty, I'll just quickly update your profile, then I'll get straight into the questions. Can I please get your post code? Thanks very much. And is that Cleveland QLD?

Can I just confirm is the total annual income before tax at least $68,600 a year Yeah, that's fine. All good then no problem. Alright, so you should receive that hard copy in the mail in about two to five business days via the e-mail will come through shortly so you can read through it straight away. Now the process is because you have been fully approved that we do start covering you straight away just in case we don't actually take any payments at this stage.
[25 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : What we do for now just to get the policy started is just set up your preferred method of payment, but you can choose a start date in the future anywhere up to 30 days away. However, of course once you do review the policy, if there is anything you don't like or even if you just decide you don't wish to proceed with it, of course that's fine, you're not obligated to keep it.
[25 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : MMM MMM MMM.
[26 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Policy does come with a full 30 day cooling off period from that first payment date as well, so you bit of extra time. So organise it for the $4000 a month with the waiting period of 30 days and the benefit period of six months. Did you want to set that up using a bank account or are these or MasterCard? Sure.
[26 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : A big bank account.
[26 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, easy. Was yours a savings account or a cheque account?
[26 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : I can put it through the business savings account.
[26 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Is that just your name on the account?
[26 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : It's bet is what names on the account are business account. Is it mine and yours or just mine? Yeah, just my account.
[26 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Sure, sure.
[26 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Is it is it savings account, isn't it? Yeah.
[26 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's fine. And just go to the business account. I just have to confirm you are authorized to debit from this account, correct? Yeah. Perfect. And all we need, Craig, just the biggest B in the account number, please.
[26 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, BSB, that's an account number. I know you're trying to work. She works for all this, right?

[27 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep, too easy. Thanks very much. As I mentioned, you can choose whatever day you'd like the payments to start. It's anywhere up from now to 30 days away. Like you've got a specific like cycle or a payday you want to line it up, which I can work around that. What date would suit you best at this stage?
[27 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, what date would what we on now? We're on the 18th today, aren't we?
[28 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yep, today's the 18th. Yep.
[28 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Pardon. She's just said started from today.
[28 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, we're still going to cover you straight away, but this is just purely in regards to when you'd like the first payment to come out, so I'm happy to schedule it for today or if you had a preferred day, whatever.
[28 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Well, I think probably if you did it the first.
[28 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure.
[28 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : It's easy to remember then.
[28 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Actually, I just realized the 1st is actually a Sunday. I could do the 2nd, 2nd of December, would that be all right?
[28 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, the second's cool. Yeah.
[28 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. That's two weeks from today. So you'll still be covered straight away, but you won't pay anything until the 2nd of December. Umm. So you basically have two weeks worth of cover, which we're not going to back charge you for. That'll give you a bit of time to review the policy as well. Just make sure you're happy with it all.
[28 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's the first 3 cover.
