[2 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : It'll be up to you guys to to arrange that. Yes, the the way it works is if you wanted to get a cover in place, man, we can. We can. We don't take any upfront payment on the day anyway. You get to choose your first preferred payment day and the day that suits you.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Where do I have to have the money for you guys to process the application or right, right.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : But just because you're calling us back, just let me quickly run through this with you. I'll only take a couple of minutes there. So like I said, for the 1st 12 months, you'll be covered against accidental death only. And then after 12 months it'll cover death due to any cause. So the cover also comes with a rule payback guarantee. So we basically guarantee that the benefit your family receives will always be minimum. The benefit of that you choose for all the premiums you pay for the funeral insurance, whichever is higher. So you really can't lose provided you keep your cover and you make no changes to it. The premiums will never increase unless you change your cover that actually reduced by 5% every five years you hold the policy.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : None.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : And just lastly, we give you what's called an early cash pay an option. So any time after you reach 85 years of age, uh, you may elect to end the cover and we'll pay back 150% of that funeral insurance benefit amount. All right? So if you're looking at 15,000 of the funeral cover, uh, you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $34.77. All right? So is that what you want to go ahead with?
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK, hold on. So it's 150% rebate not come? I mean, 150% rebate if you make it to 85.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : No, that's, it's not a rebate. It's. So what happens is after any time, after you reach 85 years of age, you can actually choose to end the cover and we'll pay you back 150% of the funeral insurance benefits. So that'll be 22 and a half, $1000 if you had, yeah, $15,000 coverage with us.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, but it's not for me. It's for my father. He's 71.
