But if you don't mind me asking, Tim, what's uh, sparked the interest looking to the income protection. No problem. I, I can see, uh, you've looked at this, uh, previously with us as well. Umm, we look at we still performing the same occupational. I can see that we have you down as a glacier. Last time you looked into it.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's right.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : If that's still the case, perfect. And you still work at least 20 hours per week. Perfect. All right, well, I'll explain to you how the income protection works and we can run through the pricing there as well. And if you have any questions along the way, just stop me. I'll be more than happy to answer any questions you have as well.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I'll let you know. Firstly it is very simple and how the income protection works. So at the end of the day it's designed to provide a monthly income benefit directly to you if you're unable to work to a disabled, sickness or entry and you suffer loss of income. So it's designed to cover your bills and your living costs if your salary is interrupted. Now we can cover you from $1000 up to 75% of your monthly pre tax income up to a maximum of $10,000 per month. Now can I ask if you are currently employed or self-employed?
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, self-employed.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So pre tax income means the total. So pre tax income means the total income generated means the income generated by the business or practice, by your personal if it's after the deduction of your share of the business or practice expenses in general in generating that income before tax and not including any personal superannuation contributions, what would you say your monthly pre tax income would be?
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : For the year, it's 40,000.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : 10 Sorry for the year. It's 40,000 is it? That's not only that. When I call you back, you can find out when we have the file back. OK, so based on that, I've got your monthly pre cuts and come down as $3333. And can I just ask team, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Now based on your income, you can choose to cover yourself between $1000 up to $2499 paid monthly there. Did you just want to look at the maximum or do you have a specific amount in mind? Sorry, I'll just confirm the $40,000 annually that was before tax.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's that's why they make them Cos oh, maybe it's small. Yeah, maybe it's small. So changes every year. Yeah, Cos we're self-employed.
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, depending on which question it is, I guess. Yeah, of course, of course.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So it's it's different every year.
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Do you know what was over the last 12 months before tax?
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, with each.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : So it was like the business itself was probably 80, but then we split it in partnership. But that, yeah, changes every year. So split between vapors, but yeah, umm, yeah, like, yeah, the 40,000 years. I'm going to cover it before I get sick. The time he's, he's for business, yeah.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, OK. Sir, is is the $40,000 what you actually earn before tax though or is that after tax? OK, OK, OK. Do you know what it would be before tax? Because, uh, I can work out what it is based on before tax then.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Before, yeah, it'd be after tax, yeah, yeah, I don't know the paperwork in front.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, Because it's hard to say how much would be able to cover you for until we obviously know how much you're actually earning because we can cover up to 75% of whatever it was that you're earning before tax.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : It's 80,000 then.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So obviously if the tax is taken out of the, so it's 80,000 before tax, OK, give me one second, I'll work that based off that. So that's $6667 before tax there monthly there. And that means we can cover you from $1000 up to $5000 paid monthly there. Did you just want to look at the maximum or did you have a specific amount in mind?
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. See what the maximum is? Yeah.
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : No problem. They also select A waiting period and they benefit. So the waiting period, the non payment period, you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event.
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : With that, you've got 30 days or 90 days. Which would you prefer to look at that? And the benefit proof, that's the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefit for anyone in for your illness. With that, you've got six months, one year, two years or five years.
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : UH-30 Yeah, Thank you. Yeah. Umm, what's the is it a massive price or?
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Umm, we can have a look at a few different ones. What, what, what amount did you have in mind? Because I can start there and then we can look at a few different ones.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. We, we haven't got this in place at the moment. We want to get something in place, but yeah, we just don't know the costing, that's all. Yep.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : All right, well, how about I quote you on the two years then to start with, and then we can look at a few different amounts.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : OK, that'll be great.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : All right. So if you're looking at $5000 paid monthly for two years with the waiting period of 30 days, you'd be looking at a fortnightly premium of $85 and one set.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yep. OK, perfect. Yep.
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So that's with the, uh, two year benefit. Did you want to look at any other amount?
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : That's yeah. No, yeah, that's fine.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So do you think he'd be happy with that with the level of income I've put down, uh, there? Can I just confirm that you've earned this level, this level of income on average for the past 12 months? Sorry, Bay. It was before tax though. So it, that was the level of income you earned before tax? Yeah. Is that right?
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Well, between us, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Perfect. Umm, And, uh, I've put the waiting period down as 30 days. Just please keep in mind the income benefit is paid in a reassessment. If you choose a 30 day waiting period, this first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible claim. Umm. So we do have to take you through some health questions to see if you are eligible for it. How about I take you through those questions now and we see if you're actually eligible for it?
