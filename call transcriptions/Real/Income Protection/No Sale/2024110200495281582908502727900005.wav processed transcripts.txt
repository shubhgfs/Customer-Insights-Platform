[8 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : No.
[8 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Very good. That was the end of it. Let's have a look now. Now because you're self-employed, I'll just quickly explain just for you, I just need to know your pre tax income. So for you, pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal assets less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. Now this is the amount that the business would otherwise seize earning in the event you were unable to work due to a disability. So just take a moment and tell me what is your annual income before tax?
[9 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : I might have to income my notice of assessment that I've just pulled up. That's what you're after, isn't it?
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Good morning. Your cross income. So I need your annual pre tax income.
[9 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So just confirming this is your annual pre tax income based on the way I've explained to you, right? Awesome. Thank you so much. Now a couple of things.
[9 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : 1121326 Yes, Yep.
[10 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So based on your duties and income, I can see that the range available for you is from $1000 up to $7077.00.
[10 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[10 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So you said you need just that 3 1/2 thousand dollars.
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's not bad for cover. Just any.
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : And is that what you need still at this point in time? OK, I'll leave it at that. Now a few a couple of other factors I need you to understand and select for yourself. So there is waiting period and then benefit. So the waiting period as you may understand already it's waiting period is a non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event.
[10 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, Yep, right.
[10 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Now if you can choose 30 days or 90 days, please keep OK?
[10 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : 30 days.
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Just please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in a reuse. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim.
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So which one did you want?
[11 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[11 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Again, the 30 days, OK. And the other one, the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefits for anyone injury or illness and your choices are six months, one year, two years or five years. You have all the four options we offer, which one do you prefer?
[11 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I had two years, I'll leave it.
[11 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[11 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Two years, I'll pay monthly.
[11 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So so far and with your current one, are you paying 490 or monthly? So monthly Visa, is that how you pay yourself with your business?
[11 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : I don't pay myself because I'm sole trader. I don't put the wage.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK. So what I'm just going to quickly do is I'm having a look at the premium that you have based on what you've chosen. So, so far it's showing a monthly payment $254.32. Is that helping your situation?
[11 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, not there.
[12 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : That's I'm very good and happy to hear that.
[12 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Now the next step Jeff is to go to that those questions because sometimes prices can change and plus I also need to see how you go with the application. So the next step is to take you through the whole the last of questions of the price and any terms of coverage determine on the outcome of these questions that I'll take you through.
[12 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Sorry. Yeah.
[12 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : And by the way, Jeff, you are going to get a reward from us as well.
