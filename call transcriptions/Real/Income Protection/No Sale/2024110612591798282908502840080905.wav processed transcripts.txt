[2 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Well, I'm getting older and my son's getting younger for some reason, but as I, as I mentioned, he's 13. I'm more interested in covering him.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Mm Hmm.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : And as I'm getting older, I don't need things like gynecology or parental or I'm not having any more babies.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Umm, he's enough. Thanks. Umm, So yeah. So I was just, yeah, looking for comparison.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So with what you have at the moment, is it a hospital covering extras or hospital only or?
[2 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's hospital and extras and I pay currently with HealthPartners. I think it's off the top of my head, it's something like $318 a month.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK. All right, so, All right, So what I would actually like to do here with you first, umm, it's just go through some questions with you so I can get a better understanding of what your needs are, what you're looking for. Umm, so then that way I can recommend suitable level of cover for yourself and also for your son.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So umm, you mentioned you're more so concerned about making sure you have the right coverage for him.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So in regards to your hospital cover, first what things are important to you to make sure that you would be covered for under your level of hospital cover? Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Umm, well I can umm, I've got a fair bit of money in the bank so I can umm, have the excess of 750 per visit and I understand that umm, once a year, no matter how many visits it is the current thing with HealthPartners, umm, and then just being a 13 year old boy that plays rugby and if he has a twisted ankle, a broken ankle, a broken arm or he's who, God, God knows what, umm, just that he has full access to hospitals and maybe any rehabilitation from a physio point of view or umm, those types of things.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK. So when you say rehab first, are you wanting to make sure he would be covered for rehabilitation? It was required in hospital. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Umm, when I say rehabilitation, yeah, I guess if he broke his ankle or his leg or whatever the case may be.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : So I stick him in hospital and he gets the treatment that he needs to have a leg, umm, fixed, not replaced. I would hope umm and just, yeah, just just things with the 13 year old boy.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, I understand. So because I'm just looking the hospital covers that and that's why I just want to clarify because I know sometimes after an injury, you do have the option to go to like a physio, umm, like that. Umm, or sometimes in regards to like if you have or like a joint replacement or you may require like rehabilitation or umm, or if it's like after you've had like a physical surgery or something in the hospital. And that that's what I'll see if that, that's what just a little see if that is thought you'd be looking for as well.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So just having so just having a look.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Oh, sorry, you're breaking up on me. Let me see if I can move my car. What did you just say?
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So I'll make sure that we I'll make sure that the football you were saying football, you were saying so he was saying he plays football. He was saying he plays football.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Oh, it it's seasonal football season. All the right thing. OK, so he's coming into the season, he's never had any injuries, but he he just, he, he's just got No Fear. So I'll look at that as a single parent to make sure he's covered.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm, mm. Hmm. OK, OK, alright. So, alright, so I'm having a look here. Look here, so I'll make sure we have coverage so I'll make sure we have coverage for enjoying unbox also fine as well as well too. Umm, just, umm, just happy, Yeah. And was there anything that you you had coverage for or is this also for him?
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Well, I guess no, I'm health healthy, I'm fit, fit. I'm but I'm 53. I'm not getting any younger. So whatever old age problems that might be out there, who knows?
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Are you, do you have any, are you, do you have any like cataracts at all or not really?
[7 minutes][Customer] : No, no, no, nothing like that.

[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : I'm I'm 100% fit.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. All right. OK. So, so just so the definition up, just so the definition up in regard of hospital coverage rehabilitation, just to see if the hospital can just to see for an example of that, for an example of that and it would be indication rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK, Can I stop you?
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So yeah.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Oh, can I stop you for a minute? I'm getting a lot of feedback. Can I just let me get upstairs? Can you call me back in about 5 minutes?

[7 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no, you're right now. OK. Keep talking. You're right now. It's good.
[8 minutes][Agent] : It's alright. So it's just saying I'm tossing up between 2 levels.
[8 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : I'm looking at the moment for the hospital cover.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : One has full coverage in regards to the rehabilitation but one has minimum benefits payable, so have a look here for you. In regards to the extras, What extras do you wanna make sure you'd be covered for?
[8 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Umm, OK. No, I guess more so for him. Physio. Umm. Chiropractic eye, uh, for glasses, umm, I'm, we're not in the massages or anything like that. Umm, we don't need gym rehabilitation if it's going to physio. So I guess it's just a comparison through through what you've got as as options for that.
[9 minutes][Agent] : OK, so I'm just having a look here. And do you use anything at all?
[9 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : No, not unless I have to. But no, I use I maybe once every two years, but in saying that, that's not that much of A benefit to me simply because I can pay for it out of pocket if I need to.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's have a look then and have either of yourself or your son, have you had to go to hospital at all, say within the last five years? Mm. Hmm.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : I have to take my breast implants out, but that was all active and I paid for that out of my own pocket. But otherwise, no, we haven't been in hospital.
[9 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK. All right. Great. Just a second. So just to clarify the things that are important to you is to cover those things for your someone like as well to discuss about the joint, bone, joint and muscle, the back and neck and spine. And I'll give you the whole options in regards to the rehabilitation. And then for your extras to have like physio, chiro, optical, is that correct?
[10 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that sounds good.
