[22 seconds][Agent] : Hi Peter, this is Kevin calling from Real Insurance.
[30 seconds][Customer] : Yes, correct.
[25 seconds][Agent] : Peter, I'm calling because I've received a quote request for you for our income protection insurance and was just looking to run through some processing information with you to see if that's suitable.
[34 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[35 seconds][Agent] : If I could just confirm I do have the right Peter. I've got the your name listed as Peter Kojewski. Kojewski. Sorry, is that how you pronounce it?
[41 seconds][Customer] : TST. Yep.
[43 seconds][Agent] : Help me with the pronunciation. Sorry, Chesky. Thank you.

[49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's correct, mate.
[54 seconds][Agent] : Yep.

[59 seconds][Customer] : No, no, you're alright. Nah.
[59 seconds][Agent] : Not you.
[1 minutes][Customer] : It's It's the last name I've had to pronounce a lot over my lot.
[1 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, got you.
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yes, correct.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Peter, your date of birth is the 25th of the 10th, 1985 and you're a male Australian resident. Very good. And you have shared an e-mail thatsjustcrp.contracting@outlook.com.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yes, crp.contracting.com. Yep, that's right.
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Peter, just letting you know calls are recorded. Any advice? The providers of general nature may not be suitable to your situation.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Just to start with. If you don't mind me asking, what's got you inquiring at the moment? Have you got some cover in place already? Is this the first time you've looked at income protection? What's your situation mean? Yep, Yep. And they and they need you to have color.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Fir first time I've ever looked at it and I've actually thought about it a lot, but I'm a oh, just a sole trader contractor and I'm moving into like government work and then they want me to have cover and I'm like, well, I've been thinking about it that long. Here's a perfect opportunity.
[2 minutes][Agent] : Yep, sure.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, it's pretty much it.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problems. Look, I, I'm a pretty straight shooter, so I like to be really upfront. So I'm gonna ask you a question that may sound funny, but often when I have people in your situations where they, they're required to have the cover for a contract, they don't really care too much about the terms and conditions. They just want to cover for the sake of the contract.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Is that the case with you or you you're actually wanting to cover over and above and you wanna look at the the details and have something in place for that purpose?
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : I actually wanna cover over and above.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Yep. Yep.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : So like at the moment, my small business is probably for this financial year, he's only going to probably profit like 30-40 grand. And as a sole trader that's classed as you, that's classed as your wage.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : And I'm like, well, I, I don't want to cover for 3040 grand and I want to cover for like 60 to 80 grand in my plan to get to. And if I do have an accident or anything like that and need that time off work, well, I can't live off the business.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Understood. Yep.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So this is running, if that makes sense. Yeah.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : That that makes that makes perfect sense.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : So yeah.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : I don't want to umm, I don't wanna put a, a, a pin in the tire straight away, but I just want to be real really clear that with the amount that we can cover you for is subject to your earnings. So we only, we'll only ever pay up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income, anywhere from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK, Yes, Yep.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : And in terms of how that's assessed, I'll give you a definition to clarify. So just, I'm just confirming you, you, you've already said that you're, you're a sole trader, but it's confirming you are self-employed, not employed. Is that correct?
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, some employed, Yeah.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, easy. So pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. So this is the the amount that business would otherwise cease earning in the event that you're unable to work due to a disability.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So with that definition held in mind, are you able to figure out what your income would be? Would would you have an idea of what that would look like as a an annual pre tax income?
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Am I able to go off last year's tax return because I've got like a tax return of about 80 odd grand?
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yeah, yeah, yeah. And and you're from what you're saying, you're expecting that to generally speaking rise. Is that the audience?
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, mate. Yeah, that's yeah, definitely, yeah.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep. You, you can go off whatever you think is reasonable. Just be mindful that we will not exceed the 70% of your monthly pre tax income.
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : It'll be assessed against your income at the time of claim over a, a 12 month period, any, any two years prior to your, your claim.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : I get you.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So I don't want to be in over insuring you having you pay more money only to come around and try and claim and, and get left in in the lurch.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yes, get less because I'll go for what I'm running at the time. Yeah. So maybe I'm just better off at the moment.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Well, well, not, not at the time. We'll assess against any two year.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : 12 the the 12, a 12 month period any two years prior to the date of the injury or illness, umm, that prevents you from working and suffering a loss of income.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : But umm, like so it's not, we're not there to stiff you like we'll, we'll assess it recently.
[5 minutes][Customer] : Oh, Nah, Nah, definitely not.
[5 minutes][Agent] : So if you're, for example, for EXA, for example, Peter, if you, if you, you know you had an injury leading into the claim that lowered your average work for a few months prior to the claim, we, we can, we can ignore those months prior and and assess it against an early period of time. It's more representational of your actual accurate income.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : But it but it's gonna be assessed against your income is all I'm saying.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So it has to be real, real, real or accurate figures to the best of your knowledge. And if you go to estimate, you should be estimating on the conservative side, not on the higher side because you'll get caught out otherwise.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Your zip code. Yeah. Yeah.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, you're very welcome.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : No, I fully understand what you're saying and I do appreciate that, Yeah.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So with all that in mind, I, I mean, I guess at the end of the day, what you're saying to me is you still need it for contracts anyway, so we might as well.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Let's get that happening.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's right.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : And then when I got more things in place that are more concrete, I can then I can up my claim, up my premium and stuff like that or something.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, you, you can. You're welcome to reapply at any stage in the future if you're going upwards, but because it because it's an increased risk, we'll still reassess your eligibility at the time. If you want to go the other way down at any stage you can reduce or cancel it out.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, Yep, right there.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, so just to start that process, I need to firstly run you through a quick duty space assessment. It's just relation to your work duties. And as it says, before answering any of our questions, it's important that you're aware of your duty to answer all of our questions accurately and honestly. And the failure to do so could impact your cover at claims time. 1st 10 just yes or no's please.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So the first one just says do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : That's a joke question for sole traders is your role of the administrative, managerial or professional nature? We spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Do I work indoors? Pretty much is what you're asking.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : It's it's asking if you're you're in a Prof like a white collar profession. So what's, what's your what's what's your line of work, man? I don't, I didn't ask you, sorry.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Nah, Nah, Oh, sorry, sorry. Sort of, yeah.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah, OK.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : I float between sort of like handyman stuff, just doing general contracting work, but I also do machinery operating, truck driving, everything.
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sort of just do all the chip jobs that no one else has.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So check checkable trades. OK, so it's gonna be a no gonna be a no for that one because you're not, uh, administrative manager of a profe professional in nature.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : But yeah, mate, Yeah, no.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : We spend the majority of your time indoors. OK. Do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle? This is in context with your job. So do you drive your vehicle to get around in your job?
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yes I do. Yes.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So answer yes and it asks are you qualified, skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role?
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : And Yep, easy. And do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation is a pile of a crew, entertainmental, sporting industry, Air Force, army, armed forces or do you handle explosives?
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : And lastly, do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights above 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul? And now your smoking status. Peter, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : No, No, no.
[8 minutes][Agent] : Good. OK. Now do you, do you want to give a shot at giving me an estimate of your annual income before tax or do you want me to?
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : I'm just on the on the thing I hear now that will before tax annual income at this present stage is 36,172. So yeah. And that that's truthfully the number. Yeah.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, OK, easy. So we'll we'll use that as a baseline to get something in place. So with that amount put in, we still are able to offer you a range of cover from $1000 up to $2109.00 as a monthly benefit amount.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : And so that that's paid monthly directly to you if you are unable to work due to a saving sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : And with the cover, once we've confirmed your eligibility through the health and lifestyle questions that I'm gonna take you through in a moment, we'll be able to give you exactly what terms we can provide to you.
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Once it's in place, Peter, it'll cover you into your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Just keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS. But also a lot of people don't realise this but the the premiums you pay for income protection, they're generally tax deductible which can make it even more cost effective for you. So umm, OK, so do you want me to load up the 2109 or any other amounts between that and $1000?
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Oh, 100% yeah, no, that, that that'll be fine. Yep.
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : That easy. OK, now you also can choose your waiting period and your benefit. So the waiting period is a non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Just keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in a RE. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment will be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. Having said that, a 90 day waiting period is approximately 40% cheaper than a 30 day waiting period. So if you're looking to make it budget friendly then and you can afford to go the 90 days as a waiting period, that's a viable option. Otherwise a 30 day waiting period is certainly a choice as well. Up to you mate. Which one would you like that's 30 or 90 days?
[9 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep, si si si 60 day O30. Sorry, 30.
[10 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yep, all good. And then the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. You can choose six months, one year, two years or five years.
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Say that one again, please, mate.
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Sure. The benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So there's a fixed time that will pay the claim on a single injury or illness before that benefit will expire. If you haven't already recovered and returned to work.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Oh, and Yep. And what are they?
[10 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : And that that, that, that the choices are six months, one year, two years or five years.
[10 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : One year, please.
[10 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : I see.
[10 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Sorry.
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, so now I'm gonna run you through those questions to confirm your circumstances now.
[10 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Go, go. Six months. Six months. Yeah, Sorry mate.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : No, All good.

[34 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[34 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Umm, On top of that, there was the exclusion that I've already discussed with you, which was in relation to yourself, employment and business continuity.

[35 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, yeah.
[35 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : We just need to confirm that the bankruptcy is fine and and if that comes back without any concerns, we'll be able to provide you with colour.
[35 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Hang on. Let me just write that down. How much?
[35 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : So to let you know where we currently stand based on your current circumstances, the costs are $20.76 a fortnight for Yep, sure, Yep, $20.76 per fortnight.
[35 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's right.
[35 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So just over $10 a week for for a monthly benefit amount of 2109. So 2109 dollars a waiting period of of 30 days and a benefit period of six months.
[35 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[35 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Now just just to give you a quick heads up, if you chose a 90 day waiting period instead, that would chapter change the cost to $10.72 a fortnight.
[35 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Oh, will do. Can we do that?
[35 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So it'd almost, yeah, of course. And then on top of that, you can also reduce the monthly benefit amount if you want to make it further cheaper.
[36 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[36 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So if you went for the absolute minimum monthly benefit amount of $1000, that would be fortnightly premium of $5.08. OK.
[36 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Oh, wow. Yeah, alright. And then later on, once I got more St.
[36 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So you got you.
[36 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : stable figures and stuff like that, I can get back on to you and we can bump that up and get a bit more of a bloody thing. They're going out again.
[36 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : You can, but just you can. But just remember, Pete, it's subject to your eligibility.
[36 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah.
[36 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : So just like we did, now you'd have to reconfirm your circumstances and make sure you're still eligible.

[36 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah.
[36 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[36 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : And then the last thing that I haven't told you that I want you to be aware of is, well, it's actually a couple of things. We provide a rehabilitation benefit with a final expenses benefit that's included in our policy. So we, the rehabilitation benefit helps you with recovery costs while you're recovering.
[36 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[36 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : The final expenses benefit is like holding a funeral insurance. So we pay out $10,000 to your loved ones in the event that you were to pass away while you call while you're holding the policy with us.
[37 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[37 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : And then and then secondly, Peter, the premium for the policy is stepped which means it'll generally increase it to your age indicatively based on the the 30 days in the six month benefit. And the $2109.00 a month benefit amount, that's $20.63 in the following year as an indication if you make no changes to the policy. So that would be your premium in the following year indicatively, OK.
[37 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, OK.
[37 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So just bear in mind that it is a step premium, even though that's going down the following year indicatively, it could go up and it generally will. OK.
[37 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Hmm. Mm.
[37 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Now you can find further information about a premium section on a website at any stage, but just keep that in mind, OK?
[37 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[37 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So from here, I'm gonna refer it through to the underwriter for assessment.
[37 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[37 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Now, if, if it comes back favorably and you're happy with the terms, would you be happy for me to provide that cover with you?
[37 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, definitely, mate. Yeah.
[37 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So our usual process in that case, Peter, is that we confirm a first payment date in the future you're happy with. I know it's down your, your method of payment.
[38 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[38 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So you can choose either direct debit or a card and I'll read a declaration statement to you, send that off to the insurer.

[38 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Have you submitted that? Great.
[38 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[38 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So when do you want the first payment date to be made?
[38 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I suppose. Yeah, probably. I do most of my pays either Thursdays or Fridays. Most of my stuff comes out.
[38 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[38 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : So maybe next Thursday or next Friday or something I could kick it off.
[38 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Easy. So next Thursday being the 9th or Friday being the 10th, Which, which would you prefer? You tell me.
[38 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : 10th, do it on the 10th.

[39 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Just give me one second Pete, in terms of what amounts we're going to set up for you. So did you want the 30 day waiting period and the six month benefit. Or you want me to knock it down to the 90 days, reminding you that the cost for the 30 days was $20.76, The cost for the 90 days was $10 and 72272 cents.
[39 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Do it to the 90 days, mate. Yeah, please.
