[1 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries.
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I was talking to someone but we missed out each other.
[1 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that's OK. I can run you back through the quotes to determine obviously a suitable level of cover for you. I'm sure you're aware as well what The income protection cover is designed to provide a monthly income benefit that is paid directly to you if you're unable to work due to any saving, sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. So it is designed to help cover your bills and living costs if your salary is interrupted. Do you also have children that you're wanting to protect with this scrap? No family or maybe just yourself?
[2 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : No, just you. That's fine. So in the event obviously something was to happen, you were unable to work, how much? How much do you feel you would need per month to get by comfortably to cover your bills or living costs?
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Only me including my mortgage everything around 9:00 to 11:50 thousand.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. So what we can offer is an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of 15,000. So we can quote you on different amounts and it will determine roughly how much obviously you earn up before tax per annum. So just so we can generate the pricing, I need to ask a few questions. So Gordon, before answering any of our questions, it is important that you're aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so, it can impact your cover and claims time. So just confirm, firstly, do you work 15 hours or more per week? Yes or no?
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment yes or no?
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm not in office. Yes, I'm not in office working. I'm I'm I'm mostly the time I'm outside.
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So no thank you. So you happy to been answered no to that question for you. Thank you. I've put no And do you perform heavy physical duties? You've had use of a machinery or drive a vehicle for your work.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yes, if I drive on my small truck.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : I say yes. You drive the small truck. Thank you. And are you qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role? Yes or no?
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : I'm qualified. Yes.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew, Entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces or do you handle explosives? Yes or no? And do you regularly work underground or underwater, Work at heights above 10 metres, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul? Yes or no? No, that's fine. And I'll also confirm your smoking status. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : No, that's fine. Thank you. So if you want to look at roughly 10 to $12,000 of cover per month, I'll start over 10,000 because I just need to determine what your annual income is before tax. So good of your pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax. This is directly due to your own personal efforts less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. So this is the amount that the business would otherwise cease earning in the event that you were unable to work due to a disability. So I need to confirm what is your annual pre tax income please? Perfect. So it's $175,000 uh, so do you want me to put it in the middle there like 162,500? I ju I just need one figure. So the annual account before tax. What would it be if you had to put one figure on it?
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Between 1:50 to 175, 150 two 175 around 160.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : 160 OK perfect. 160,000 thank you. So if based off your annual income before tax for 160,000, the maximum monthly benefit amount we can actually offer is $9333 because don't forget we're offering up to 70% of the monthly pre tax income. Are you OK for me to start the quote on that amount? Then based on your annual income? OK, thank you. Next you can choose is your waiting periods and your benefit periods for the quote. So could have waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event occurs. Two options we provide that you could choose are 30 days or 90 days waiting period. Do you know what about you'd like me to quote you on for the waiting period?
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I want to understand how much that premium is.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Correct. So the premium will depend on what waiting period you choose. So a 30 day waiting period will be a higher premium than if you choose a 90 day waiting. So which, which waiting period would you like me to select first for the quote?
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : What about 60 days?
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : We don't have that as an option. So it's 30 days or it's 90 days.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : The 90 days? How much?
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. Let's have a look at 90 days and just keep in mind the income benefits paid monthly in arrears. So if you choose a 30 day waiting period, for example, your first payment will be 60 days after your first sellers with a claim. If you choose a 90 day waiting period, your first payment will be 120 days after your first sellers with a claim. Next is the benefit. So please choose which option you would like for the benefit. The options are six months, 12 months, two years and five years and it's just the maximum amount of time that will pay the benefit to you for the way for the benefit. For anyone injury or illness. So example is if you choose a six month benefit. But you're off work for a year, we'll only pay you for six months. So do you know what benefit. You'd like me to quote you on? Six months, one year, two years or five years?
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : I have been told it's up to 65 years.
[8 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So the policy itself, it covers you up until your 65th, It will follow your 65th birthday for your policy anniversary. But the benefit. For any particular one that even real illness is dependent on which you choose.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : So but what is the per person is not able to work for a very long, long time, more than say five years? What you are saying then?
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So 6 months, one year, sorry, can you repeat the question?
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : What if a person is not able to work more than five years because of any reason then?
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So that's, that's the maximum benefit. You're eligible to apply for on this policy. So for example, uh, let's say you're off work for a broken leg first time, umm, claim and you've, you've got five year benefit. But you only stay off work for a year. You still have 4 years remaining of that benefit period to utilize. If it, if it reoccurs again, you can apply to claim on if that makes sense because obviously the income protection is designed to get you back to work as quick as possible.
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I understand, buddy.
[9 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Sorry.
[9 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : But injuries, take example, somebody's eyes are gone, or somebody's football foot is gone, that is gone. So then that means he can't work all his life. That's what I'm trying to understand.
[9 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I see. Yes. So that is still based on your benefit. Though. So that's how our product works. So it's dependent on what your benefit. Is, for how long we'll pay you. And it also will be balanced at the time of claim whether you're receiving any other benefit payments, for example, work cover or anything else. Obviously you're self-employed. So just want to clarify that for you. So even if you lose your leg, the unfortunate event, knock on wood, it would still depend on how much, how long your benefit. Is.
[9 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : So why? He said to me 65 years before?
[9 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : That's what age your policy expires.
[10 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So in any occupation, 65 years?
[10 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So anyone that applies for this cover, yes, that's just the policy that we provide is that it covers you into your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Thereafter, the policy expires.
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Well, I mean, if somebody's a a politician or accountant or a banker or any other occupation then.
[10 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : It doesn't matter what your occupation is, that's just the policy that that's how long it'll cover you up until for our policy that we provide.
[10 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Oh alright, just because I heard that some applications have longer tenure for the payment, it's just I won't understand the policy of the conditions.
[10 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So that's why I'm explaining with our policy grew up, that's, that's just the policy expiry age for any occupation because it's dependent on your duties that you take place in at work, which will determine not only your approval, but also the application that we take you through to determine if you're actually eligible for the cover as well. So there's still an application process after the quote which will determine if you're even eligible. So not everyone is approved for the policy. That's why I just want to strictly take you through a quote first. So let me give you an example. If you choose a six month benefit. With the 90 day waiting period, the premium would be $48.64 a fortnight for the $9333 monthly benefit.
[11 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm. OK.
[11 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Do you want to look at any other benefit periods?
[11 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Well what about I have to include the PPD as well?
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : TBD is not included on this policy.
[11 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : So how can one include PPD?
[11 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Uh, TPD is included in a life insurance policy. That's a completely separate policy.
[11 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's what I have been told by this. I have to take PPD too. So I want to understand that how can include PP, how much the premium would be?
[11 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So total and permanent disability is not included in income protection. It's included in our life insurance. So you're saying you also want a quote on life insurance to get a quote for TPD because we don't provide TPD by itself. It's something that's an optional actually you can add on to your life insurance. You have to apply for life insurance first.
[12 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : And how much is the premium for that?
[12 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Sure. So, so the life insurance you can choose from $100,000 up to 1,000,000. Do you know what amount you'd like me to quote you on for the life and the TPD?
[12 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it is 100,000 plus the PPD. Then how much the premium is?
[12 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, let me just load that up for you. So you said 100,000, is that correct? Yep. OK, perfect. So I'll just pop that in. Just bear with me. OK, TPD and you said your removal list for TPD, so you work how many hours of do you work per week? Do you work at least a bit, a bit of 20 hours per week? OK, perfect. And your removal list, So I'll just is it strictly just furniture removal?
[12 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[13 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yes. OK. OK, perfect. So if you want to look at $100,000 of TPD, that's alongside the life insurance, it'll cost you $20.54 a fortnight. So that's $100,000 of life insurance and $100,000 of TPD.
[13 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : So same is same, the PPD is same as As for them and life insurance is same.
[13 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : You could choose life insurance all the way up to $1,000,000 and then the TPD. You could choose whatever amount you want up to the maximum amount of life insurance that you have.
[14 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, I'll just stick to this right now the the income protection. So how much is the premium?
[14 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So if you want to go higher, we could go higher for example, so the premiums $48.64 a fortnight if you would. We could choose the six month benefit. With the 90 days waiting, sure five years. If we change that benefit period of five years, the premium will adjust to $137.99 a fortnight.
[14 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I have to do five years, 100-3799, OK.
[14 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, and that's with the 90 days waiting period uh, for the monthly benefit amount of $9333 and you get a refund on this policy back uh, through our real rewards. So following your first policy anniversary date, we refund you 10% back of the premiums you've paid in that time. Yeah, sure. 30 days waiting period with five year benefit. For the same monthly benefit amount will be $208.98 per fortnight.
[14 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : What about 30 days and that's for five years.
[15 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : That's for five years.
[15 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : So I'll just get back to you on that.
[15 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Do you want me to e-mail the quotes to you?
[15 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that should be OK. Thank you.
[15 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. I've got your e-mail colleague044@gmail.com.

[29 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : So I want to just make up my mind and sort out my budget and then I get back to you on that just in 2-3 days.
[29 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, No worries with the benefit. Then, then I'll send the quote out for D Will you set on five years or were you open to having a lower benefit. Which could potentially bring your costs down as well?
[30 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : I know I prefer the five years, but I just about think about this 30 or 90 days term.
[30 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK, 30 or 90. All right, I'll send you both quotes. So I'll send you the 30 days or the 90 days, two separate quotes. And as your cover's been fully approved, I'm going to e-mail you the policy schedule for that $9333 monthly benefit amount with the waiting period of the 90 days. One with the benefit period of five years. It's pending activation. So if you decide you want to take out the 90 day waiting period policy, you can activate it yourself through the e-mail when you're ready and all the doctors will automatically be posted. How does that sound?
[30 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : That that sounds better. Thank you.
[30 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Sounds good. You're welcome and I'll quickly give you a premium projection while I have you. As it is income protection cover, your premium is stepped which means it will generally increase each year as you age. You're more than welcome to discuss this with your financial advisor as well. Otherwise as an indication for you. So if you want to make the changes to the policy, then your premium next year per fortnight would be $217.71 for your monthly benefit amount of 9330, $3.00 with the 30 day waiting period. Sorry with the 30 day waiting period and the five year benefit. So let me just change that to 90 days. I'm sorry because I'm gonna send you that out. Please bear in mind, uh, it is password protected, the e-mail I sent. So it will be your date of birth to access it as the password. Does that make sense?
[31 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[31 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So if we adjust that waiting period to 90 days, I apologize. The premium per fortnight is $137.99. So as an indication if you make no changes to the policy then your premium next year will be $143.70 a fortnight good of for that monthly benefit amount.
