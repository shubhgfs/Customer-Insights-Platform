So we'll pop the relevant questions in for that one. But before we do that one with the income protection, are you looking to obviously, would that one be, you know, purely in place to help cover for any of your living costs or your salary? Uh, and obviously is there a mortgage you're also looking to protect? Uh, I don't have any mortgage at the moment. Yep.
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Oh, well, I don't have any mortgage at the moment, but so I, I really, yeah, I really don't know how it works, but what I, what I'm looking for is just a protection from myself.

[2 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Whenever I get injury, I I would like to be covered.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : I, I would like to call the of course, but that's exactly what the company is going to provide.

[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, OK.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : What the Income Protection is designed to do is help cover for your bills and any of your living costs if your salary is interrupted whilst you are able to work and obviously make an income now, as long as you work at least 15 hours per week in paid employment, you can apply for the income protection now. What we offer is an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. Now, Daniel, that will be salary dependent. So we'll just need to know what the annual income pre tax would be and then we can work out how much we can provide for you. Then what we would, uh, I mean, it's actually different because, you know, I get invoices, different invoices and different amount of invoices every year.

[3 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So what say this is what you would make before you pay tax, let's say 150,000, that's fine. So what we'll do, we'll pop 150,000 in just a little bit later on. Umm, So what we would then do is ask you some health and lifestyle questions over the phone to see if you are approved and if so, on what terms. We can offer the cover to you. Now, Daniel, once that cover is in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Now keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS. Now also keep in mind that the with the premiums that you pay there for income protection, they are generally tax deductible as well, which can actually make it more cost effective for you.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.

So it just says here, do you work 15 hours or more per week?

Unless any business expenses and excluding super contributions, this is the amount that the business would otherwise cease earning in the event that you were to be unable to work due to a disability. So to see what is your annual pre tax income, you mentioned me to me that was 150,000 of 150,000 in and now with that one here based on your duties and income you can select a monthly benefit amounts. So this is what we will pay to you if you were to have that disability or sickness. So you can choose a benefit amount from $1000 up to the maximum of $8750 per month.

So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So which waiting period would you like me to select? A 30 or a 90 day?
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : What's better?
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Well, it's completely up to you. It's, it's how umm. So again, with a 30 day waiting period, the first payment would be, uh, 60 days, where with a 90 day, the first payment wouldn't be for 120 days.

[9 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So what would happen with the benefit. So if you were to obviously sustain a disabling sickness or injury, this is how long that we would pay the $6000 a month to you.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Ah, OK.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So if you chose a six months, we pay it for six months. If you chose a one year, would pay it for one year. It's all depending how long that you feel that you would need that benefit amount to be paid to you.

So what if I can set the lymph node, umm, on his left upper neck and went and had an ultrasound always that's came back clear. Umm was told, umm, if it gets bigger. So it was told if it gets bigger to come back. Uh, but initially no concerns from the doctor. Is that correct?

[30 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful initially but initially no concerns. OK beautiful initially no concerns. 3 months ago was the last check up. Last scan was last month and results were all clear and doctors were not concerned, correct?
[31 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[31 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Alright, so let me submit the application through for you here. It just takes about, uh, a minute for it to just generate. But look, whilst I am awaiting back the response, everything that I have explained to you that today so far, has that all been clear and understood?
[31 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[31 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yes, beautiful. Alright, let me just pull up the results. What we'll need to do for this one here is we will just need to refer the application off to the underline is just to have a look at the for that scan for the lymph notes. So your application needs to be referred to the underwriter for assessments. Now there was as well just one exclusion that has just popped up. So that's self-employed business, uh, continuality. So it says the income benef, the in the income protection benefit will be reduced by any income you received or are entitled to receive from any businesses you have an in interest in subsequently. So sorry subsequent to the disablement date, this adjustment only apply where the total amounts of the benefit payable plus the ongoing income exceeds 70% of your pre disability income. But now the final price has light up as well. So if you were to be looking at a monthly benefit amount of $6000 with a 30 day waiting period and a six month benefit. Every two weeks, $39.23.
[32 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : That's the amount I have to pay, which would be annually.
[32 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So very, very close to the $20 a week, correct, $39.23, uh, annually, yeah, I could pop it annually for you. So annually there, that one would work off to be $1019.88 per annum. So how's that one sounding?
[33 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes, sounds good. Can I pay? Can I pay annually?
[33 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Of course, you can say whether you pay for it annually, uh, for nearly a monthly, the cost does wake up the same, but happy to leave it as annually for you. But what we still need to do is just, uh, send the application off to the underwriters just to have a look at the lymph node, umm disclosure there. But there is some further benefits that we do provide there for the income protection. So we have a rehabilitation benefits along with a final expenses benefit which pays $10,000 in the event that you do pass away to assist with any sort of funeral costs or other file expenses. So your family can request that $10,000 if you do pass away there Daniel.

[33 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Now your premium is step, which means it would generally increase age or as you age. But as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year would be $1072.66 per annum, still covering you there for $6000. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. So what I say, what we now need to do is just, uh, send this one off to the underwriter. So, uh, what we do at this point here is we, uh, obviously we'll get everything off to you via the post and also to the e-mail when the underwriters do come back if they've made no changes. So what we do at that point there is, umm, we do let you choose a day in the future for that first annual premium that Daniel, because we do not require you to pay for the cover straight away. So what we can do is we can push that first annual premium up 30 days for you. So no need to pay for the cover today, not tomorrow up to 30 days. So what day did you want us to do that first annual premium bond?
[34 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So today is the third. Let's do the 3rd of November or the 1st of November up to 30 days. 1st of November, yeah.

Are you happy for me each record your acceptance of this policy now and we will send out all of your policy information to your e-mail and and also postal address. Yes or no?
