[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.

[1 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So I'll go through how it works and then we can look at a quote and then we can check your eligibility. So before I go into that, Please note all of our calls are recorded and any advice that provides general in nature may not be suitable for your situation. And can I just confirm your first name, last name and date of birth?
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Alright.

[1 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Sam Rutten 20th September 90, threeitsruttenfabrication@gmail.com.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yep, thank you. OK, so income protection insurance, basically we'll just go over what we have to cover and then we'll go into the quote.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So this is designed to provide a monthly income benefit paid directly to you if you're unable to work due to the disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. If you are replacing an existing policy, we do recommend that you do not cancel it until your application has been approved and you have reviewed this policy in full, as it may not be identical to your existing cover. And you should also consider the benefits that may not apply or waiting periods that may start again. So with the income protection, we offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000 of cover. Very easy to apply for. We'll just ask you some help from Microsoft questions on the phone. Now, once the policy is in place, it will cover you into your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. And keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS. OK, now, uh, for this one here we'll go over a duty based assessment. That's just a few questions about your job and then we'll go into a quote. So could I please confirm that you are a male Australian resident?
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And in regards to duty based assessment, uh, before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your coverage claims time. So the first question just says, do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yes or no thank you.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : No.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment yes or no thank you. Do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle? Yes or no? Yep.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yes.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Are you qualified, skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licences to perform your role?
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yes or no thank you. Do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, army, armed forces or do you handle explosives, yes or no? Do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights above 10 metres, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul?
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yes or no thank you. So that's the duty. Best assessment complete so thanks for your patience going through that. In regards to the quotes, are you currently employed or self-employed?
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Self-employed.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts, less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. This is the amount the business would otherwise cease earning in the event you are unable to work due to disability. So, uh, for this one here, umm, your annual income before tax is what we looked at to get an idea of what we can provide for you. So what's your annual income before tax?
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Well, yeah, that's the tricky part.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Well, it it'll have to be 100 grand minimum because yeah, like my first year out on my own.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Mm, hmm.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : So it's like, yeah.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : So I'm expecting to earn 100 grand, yeah.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So $100,000 And so that means, uh, based on your duties and income, you can select a monthly benefit amount from between $1000 being the minimum up to 5833 dollars of cover. Uh, the higher amount of cover you choose, the higher the cost and vice versa. Umm, So what? What monthly benefit amount would you like me to quote you on?
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep, 5000 please.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yep, no worries. Now we look at a waiting period and a benefit. As well. So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. And please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. This means the future is a 30 day waiting period. Your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So which waiting period would you like me to select out of 30 days or 90 days?
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : 30, please.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : And the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So you can choose six months, one year, two years or five years. So which benefit. Do I can select?
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. Six months, please.
[5 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So for a monthly benefit amount of $5000 of cover with a waiting period of 30 days and benefit a period of six months, we'll go into a quote for that. And for your smokers status, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Nah. Nah.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So fortnightly the premium for this SIM would equate to $41.46 per fortnight.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Keeping in mind the waiting period of 30 days being the lowest waiting period does bring up the price. 90 days of course being a long, the waiting period would produce the cost, but if you want to leave it at that, it's 4146 fortnight. And of course, with this policy, your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each as you age.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So I'll give you an example of how that looks. Did you want me to leave it at the quote we've looked at there or did you want me to change anything? Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Well like just out of interest if I go to 150 grand a year, how much does that how much does that change?
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : The monthly benefit amount. MM hmm.
[6 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, the monthly benefit and then if we up the monthly benefit, how much does it change the premium? Sorry the.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So if your if your annual, so if the annual income before tax is one $50,000 of cover, then you can choose between 1000 up to $8750.
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : 6000, please.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Which monthly benefit amount will drive me to quote you on 6000? Yep. OK, so if you're looking at a $6000 monthly benefit amount, do you want me to leave it at the 30 day waiting period or the 90 day?
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So we'll go 6000 monthly benefit amount with a 30 day waiting period and a six month benefit. Is that correct?
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So that would be $49.75 per fortnight.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah. 6 bucks. Yeah. OK. A fortnight. Yep.
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep. Now, umm, in regards to the rehabilitation benefit you get with this, the policy has a rehabilitation benefit included. So this pays a reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit to a maximum of $3000 to help with rehabilitation costs whilst claiming. Or we can reimburse up to six times your income benefit towards cost of equipment or modifications required to assess your return to work. And it also includes the final expenses benefit as well.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So this is a bit of a morbid topic, but basically this pays 10,000 dollars in the event that you pass away to help us assist with funeral costs or final expenses for your family.
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. Yeah.
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm now in regards to the premium projection, I'll give you a an idea of how that looks. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, then your premium next year would be $46.48 a fortnight and your monthly benefit amount would be $6000 with a waiting period of 30 days and a benefit period of six months. I know you're probably thinking, you just told me it will increase and it looks like it's gone down. Umm, it does have age as a factor.
[9 minutes][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So uh, currently at $49.75 a fortnight, the following you would actually go down to $46.48 a fortnight, umm, in 2020, 633 though it would be 4956 a fortnight.
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Oh, you got like that. Yep.
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, now in regards to umm, the premium structure, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website if you need to anyway, but we just like to go over that on the phone to make sure it's clear. And uh, you get a refund of $129.34 paid back to your, uh, to pay back to you following your first policy anniversary date with this one, uh, just after the first year, It's basically like a thank you for being with us. Uh, pay.
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, Yeah, OK.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Umm, another thing with income protection insurance, uh, we aren't financial advisors of course, but keep in mind that the premium full income protection, uh, so the premiums, full income protection are generally tax deductible, which can make it even more cost effective for you. And, uh, when it comes down to eligibility, we'll go over those health and lifestyle questions now and see how you go. This of course, will give us the outcome.
[9 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[9 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So I'm just gonna pop Sure.
[9 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : I've just a quick question.
[9 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : MMM, mm, hmm. Mm, hmm. Mm hmm.
[9 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Can I up one, up the income protection and two, change the the length of just say say in two or three, four years time I'm earning well more and I need like a hire cover and a longer period. I can change that at any time.
[10 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : With this one here, you can only apply to do the lower risk on on our end. So for example, if you have $6000 monthly benefit amount, you can apply to decrease the benefit amount at any time, but you can't apply to increase it.
[10 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[10 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : If you have a waiting period of 30 days, you can apply to have it up to the 90 days. But if you had 90 days to start off with, you can't apply to bring it to 30. Umm, And if you have a benefit period of six months, that's the lowest benefit. You can select. So you can't apply to bring it down further, and you can't apply to increase it. But if you had a higher benefit. Then you can apply to decrease it.
[10 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, Yep, yeah, OK, OK, OK. Yep, Yep, Yep. That makes sense.
[10 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, now when it comes down to the policy itself though, for whatever reason, uh, you want to reevaluate, you know, laid down the track, uh, there are no cancellation fees locking con, uh, sorry, there are no cancellation fees locking contracts. So you can call up and apply to cancel at any time. And with this policy, uh, you can apply up until the age of 60 years old, subject to eligibility at the time if you're an Australian resident. OK now umm, in regards to that, has that answered your question?
[11 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[11 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And what was your post code for your home address? 6255 OK and the suburb?

[22 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yes or no, ADHD or ADD, yes or no, uh, other mental illness, yes or no, umm, have In regards to the one we said yes to, how many episodes have you had which required treatment? So for this one, we do have a definition of what we mean by episodes, which we'll rate out too, just because sometimes people get a bit confused on this one. So let me pull it up now. Medical definitions. Bear with me one SEC. OK, so it's a bit of a lengthy umm definition, but it gives us examples. Well to make it a bit easier. So it just says an episode is an event, occurrence or recurrence of symptoms with increased severity from normal mood and usually require either medical intervention, referral, treatment or alterations slash adjustments to existing maintenance treatment. So treatment can take the form of medication and or counselling, flash therapy. So these are the examples. So if someone has mental health symptoms that require treatment this is an episode and if they return to their doctor several times to monitor the situation and also repeat prescriptions this is the same single episode. If, however, they have a relapse or symptoms worsen and treatment needs to be changed or increased, then this constitutes the second episode.
[24 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Bye.
[24 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Similar to this, if the applicant recovers and treatment stops and the applicant's fine, but then at a later date symptoms return and they have to go back to the doctor to seek further advice, this will be a separate episode. So basically Sam, umm, if someone has mental health symptoms that require treatment, this is an episode, and if they return to the doctor several times to monitor the situation and also repeat descriptions, this is still the same single episode. So for yourself, how many episodes have you had which required treatment? Would you say 1 to 2/3 to 4/5 to 6/7 plus? Yep. And then it says was it more than one episode? Yes or no? Yep. Have you had symptoms or treatment for this condition within the last six months? Yes or no?
