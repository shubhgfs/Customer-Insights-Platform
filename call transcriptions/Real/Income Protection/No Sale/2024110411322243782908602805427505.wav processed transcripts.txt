So to give you some pricing to start off with, if you did go for your maximum cover, which will be the $4403 right, includes 30 days and benefit period of two years, you would be looking at exactly $117.46 per fortnight for that.

[26 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 50 and no problems. I'll leave that there. And just to make it aware with your premiums, it is step to many will generally increase each as you age. And just to give you a bit of an indication to say if you make no changes to that cover your premiums for next year, you'd be looking at $121.43 a fortnight for next year as a projection. And if you ever need to, you can also find information about that premium structure on the website. But we do get everything out to you via e-mail and also a hard copy through the post to you as well. And if you are happy with the policy, what we can do from here to get that referred off. There's no upfront payments required even to get you covered after that as well. So you can select your payment date in the future, link it to the account of a choice and reach out the declaration over the phone to get your acceptance of that one. Is that something you're happy to proceed with?
[26 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Is it active from today?
[26 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So what we'll need to help because it does need to be referred to the underwriter for assessment.
[27 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. I thought you said that.
[27 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Umm, which means yes, so that they just may be sent off to the underwriter. So they review the application just to confirm that's umm, good to go. And then, so if it has been approved with no changes, we're able to get you covered immediately. As soon as that does come back, uh, which being later on this afternoon, it may not come back to because it'll be off on the weekends for the underwriters. It may not come back into Monday at, uh, which I should keep the final outcome for that one.
[27 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, it makes sense.
[27 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : If you, if there's, uh, if they do it approval without any changes, would you be happy for you to record your, the acceptance of the policy now and send you out all the information to your e-mail and postal address?
[27 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, correct.
[27 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Easy. We can get that done and what I'll do now for you. So I'll link it to the account of your choice and we can set a payment date in the future for you. So if that does come back fully approved, we can get you covered. And again, there's no upfront payments required to get you covered immediately after that. Was there a day you'd like your first payment to start from 30 days? Let me have a look. I'll see how far I can push this one out. OK. Yep.
[27 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Then the 3030 days WH what does 30 days get it to it get to line it up for a Tuesday when the when the pay comes in on Tuesday.
[28 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, on the Tuesdays, do that. Let me have a look for you.
[28 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : That's all mate, Is it?
[28 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yes, 15th. I'm pretty sure I can. Let me just double check. Yeah, Tuesday the 15th. Yeah, I can do that. That's fine. So I'll check it for the Tuesday the 15th and just be every fortnight after that for you. And would you want this one to come from a Visa or MasterCard or just a BSDN account number? BSB, is this one a savings or check account?
[28 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Is it 15th BSD savings?
[28 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Savings and account name that's just under your name. All good. OK. And when you're ready, I'll note down the BSB number there.
