So you mentioned BHP, so is that with the, uh, income protection or is that a separate policy you hold with them?
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No, like that.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : That's who I work for and stuff and I've got like, yeah, yeah, you, you know, you get sick leave and stuff like that.
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yep, of course.
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : But I just think like a just to be unforeseen, you know, like like like, like my dog had a had a car accident, started to take time off work and yeah, just things like that just just raise the issue that I was thinking to myself, so sorry if I do you have an accident or whatever, like, and I don't have to display there. How am I gonna pay the bill? Mm hmm.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yep, of course, not a problem at all. Well, by look, that's exactly what the income protection is they're designed to do. It's so they help cover, you know, if your bills and bills and living costs is interrupted during the time, umm, now without income protection, you'd need to be unable to work due to possess a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Now as long as you do work at least 15 hours per week in paid employment, you can apply for the income protection.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Now what we offer is an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : MM hmm.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Now how we do determine how much somebody would be eligible is through the annual income pre tax. Then what we would do is ask you some help and livestock questions over the phone to see if we can get you approved and if so on what terms we can offer the cover to you. Now once that policy is in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS. Now by with the income protection, I'm not too sure if you know, but it's generally tax deductible as well, which could actually make it even more cost effective for you at the end of the day. So let's now take you through the duties based assessment. What that one does is initially would check there if you would be eligible for the income protection. So before answering any of our questions, it is important that you're aware of your duty to answer all that questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your cover at claims time. Now, do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yes, mate, yes, a lot more.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's OK. Now, is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment, yes or no?

[4 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : So I spend kind of like, I guess you call like 50% of the time in my office and then 50% of the time I just go in my youth and go and check on the job and then come back to the come back to the office kind of thing.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yep, yeah, yeah, no problem. So look, this this question is only asking where you spend the majority of your time. So it comes down to how you answer it. So, umm, do you feel the majority is an is an is in outdoor or umm, you know, in or out the majority of it.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I I reckon the majority would have to say them out outdoors. Yeah. Like like, yeah, not can't be down to the office. Yeah, a bit in the outdoor.

[5 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : No. I quit smoking cigarettes probably nearly nearly two years ago now.
[6 minutes][Agent] : Wow, Congratulations. Good for the wallet and also good for the health.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, I understand.
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Umm, yeah. All right. So are you currently employed or self-employed? Thank you.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Employee full time.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So the pre tax income is the total annual remuniation paid to you by your employer but before tax, excluding super contributions including salary and regular commissions or bonuses. So what is your annual pre tax income?
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : I like, like what my pay G thing is that we get what the tax get.
[6 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So it would just need to be the annual pre tax income. So what you make before tax? 1000, Yep. Yep.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Is that what you, it was 178,000 of this year's tax return, but I think that includes my I don't know if it's like my, my base income is 100 and 51, but then you get like, like it.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I have the time and stuff like that.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Overtime and super on all hours and things like that. But my, my base is $149,000 a year.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK so this is only asking what you made umm and your pre tax income.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So on the on that certificate shows that showed 178,000 beautiful. No problems at all. Umm. Now based on your duties and income, you can select A benefit amount anywhere from $1000 per month up to the maximum of $10,383 per month. So that's the maximum benefit amount that we can pay to you. So what did you feel was enough coverage for the income protection?
[7 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : I'd like to do like, like would kind of like replicate what my earnings are per month to do that like say if I was incapacitate, incapacitated to be able to work, then I'd like to try to get like replicated my wages as close to to possible, if that makes sense.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yep, yes. So just keep in mind, uh, with our uh income protection, it's a benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, no, that's fine.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So that's OK. So as I said, the maximum we can provide for you is 10,383 per month with the minimum being $1000.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I fully understand that it's so yeah, well done.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So we can choose anywhere in between those levels. So what did you feel was enough, you know, as a monthly benefit amounts?
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK, so my two pays are tax per month, fortnightly is about 48. So can I do? Let's go look at 9000.
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yep, no problems. I'll pop in for 9000 now. The waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured events. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So which waiting period would you like me to select? A 30 day or a 90 day waiting?
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Does the waiting period affect anything else in the CLA in the in the claim like what people are? Why would why would you choose like the 90 day one and to wait that long? But but. Oh yeah.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So some people may choose a 90 day one if they've say got enough in sick leave or they have like other funds that they can, you know, afford to live up to, you know, that that time frame without getting a benefit amount where with some people that may not have access to, you know, that long of sick leave or they might not have any money left behind or spare. So that's why there is an option there to do a 30 day or 90 day waiting.
[9 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, to be safe, I'll do the 30 day one please.
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : 30 Of course, no problems at all. Now the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So you can choose a benefit period from six months, one year, two years or five years. So keep in mind what this one means is if you were to, you know, have a disabling sickness or injury and you off work for say six months would pay it for six months. If you're off work for one year, you would pay it for one year and vice versa. So you have the option there of a six month benefit. A one year, A2 year or A5 year benefit. So umm, what would you like me to select? Yes. So the cost is determined on obviously these factors. So having a shorter waiting period, uh, the cost would be adjusted to that. Having a longer, uh, you know, amount of time that we have to pay the benefit amounts, uh, those costs would be adjusted to would be a little, the, the, the five years would be more expensive than a six month benefit. Because we're paying it for a longer time.
[10 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Does it also does it affect the figure that we that it comes to like the the Yeah, understood. Yeah.
[11 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK. It Co it it comes out of how long you think that you know you would need the income for?
[11 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : May I please have and would take to get work? Yeah, it's it's choose a year and then like during the policy, if if I rethink it and think, oh, maybe I should do a year, two years or maybe I should do six months. Can you change it during it?
[11 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yep, I don't believe you can because I think it would be locked in. I'll just get further confirmation if you just bear with me 30 seconds, I'll just ask the question.
[11 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : OK. Thank you.
[12 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : All right. Thanks for holding it both.
[12 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So with this one here, you can decrease the benefit, you won't get an increase. If you went for a two year benefit. You could bring it down to a one year. You couldn't increase up to say A5 year.
[12 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[12 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So if you're the six months, you couldn't increase it up to A1 year?
[12 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK. I'll do one year please.
[12 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yep, one year, no problems at all. Umm, Now the next step you bought is to take you through the health and lifestyle questions as the price and any terms of cover is determined on that outcome. So let's take you through those questions there and then we can see if we can get you approved and then as of what happened, then it will generate the pricing for us.

[18 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Not a problem at all. By the next questions here are just in regards to medical history questions are all still yes and no. But there is a main question here that we do refer back to with all these questions. And that main question says, have you ever had symptoms of, been diagnosed with, or treated for, or intend to seek medical advice for any of the following cancer, tumor, mole or cyst, including skin cancer, sunspots, Melanoma or leukaemia? Have you ever had an uh, abnormal PSA test or an enlarged prostate?

Hepatitis, already disorder of the liver, stomach, bowel, gallbladder or pancreas. Epilepsy, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's disease or paralysis. UMM, anxiety, depression or stress requiring medical treatment or any other mental health disorder.
[18 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I did about, well a few years ago for anxiety, take a tablet from the, like, prescription medication from my local doctor.
[19 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[19 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : But that, yeah, that, that, that was for like when I, I had a break up with my boy's mum.
[19 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, yeah, yeah, not a problem at all. He said that, uh, and how long ago was that? OK.
[20 minutes][Customer] : That was years ago now, yeah.
[20 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : That's OK because it it'll just ask us a follow up question in regards to that one. So it says is your condition a form of schizophrenia, bipolar or psychotic disorder? Yes or no? OK, and this is your condition. So I've got depression, anxiety, postal depression or stress, including post traumatic stress disorder, anorexia nervosa or bulimia, ADHD or ADD or other mental illness. So you said it was just anxiety, was it?
[20 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Oh no, yeah. Like I, I feel a bit of anxiety and a bit of depression. I I think that like, I just didn't feel right, you know?
[20 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, comple, comple. Completely understandable based on the situation there. Umm, so it just says here, how many episodes have you had which required treatment? So I've got one to 2/3 to 4/5 to six or seven plus.
[20 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I just, yeah, I think yeah, zero. Like, I've never had a episode of anything. Like, I guess you know when you just will find it hard to get out of bed, so you just kind of go to the doctor and say that.
[20 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep, Yep. OK, look what I'll do. I'll give you our definition of what we deem as an episode because based off what you're mentioning to me that it would fall under 1 episode, but I'll just give you our definition.
[21 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : They just say I said it might be depressed, you know, OK.
[21 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So an episode is an event, occurrence or recurrence of symptoms with increased severity from normal mood and usually require either medical intervention, referral, treatment, alteration, adjustment to existing maintenance treatment. Now treatment can take the form of medication and they'll count counseling or therapy. Now our three examples here are if someone has mental health symptoms that require treatment, this is an episode and if they return to the doctor several times to monitor the situation and therefore repeat prescriptions, this is the same single episode. If, however, they have a relapse or symptoms worsen and treatment needs to be changed or increased, then this constitutes a second episode. Similarly, if the applicant recovers and treatment stops and the applicant is fine, but at a later date symptoms return and they have to go back to the doctor to seek further advice, this would be a separate episode. So if we go back to that overarching question there, umm, it says how many episodes have you had which required treatment? One to 2/3 to 4/5 to six or seven plus. So we so we just, so you would just trade it for the, for the one. Uh, so you would just trade it for the the one condition there. OK, Yep. And was it more than one episode? Yes or no?
[22 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, Yep, one please, no one episode.
[22 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And have you had symptoms or treatment for this condition within the last six months?
[22 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : It was well, when it said you said that you you get given a prescription and the you get a repeat. It's just stayed on that.
[22 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, so you say, OK, so currently still on medication though for that. OK, yeah, not a problem at all. So we'll say yes to this question then because technically you are still on the medication. And have you ever seriously contemplated or attempted suicide? Yes or no?
[23 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no.
[23 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Thank you very much. And have the factors or causes that triggered the symptoms been partially or fully removed?
[23 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yes, fully removed.
[23 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yes or no, Thank you. And in the last 10 years, have you required hospitalization as a result of this condition? Thank you. All right, let's continue on.

[31 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : No one 100% yes.
[31 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. All right, so two things I'll need to just discuss for this. So the first one is we will just need to refer the application off to the underwriters just to have a look at the shoulder key health surgery you had 14 years ago.
[32 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[32 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Then the second thing that has just popped up is a exclusion. So no benefit will be payable for any disability, condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to or arising from mental health disorder or illness, stress, drug or alcohol abuse. But other than that, umm, it's made no changes to the price. Umm, So I can now let you know what you would be looking at. So let's jump out. OK, so if we look at a $9000 monthly benefit amounts with a 30 day waiting period and a one year benefit. Per fortnight, $123.47 uh, per fortnight for that one there.
[32 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : That's fortnight 123, 123 and that's fortnight and that's for 9000 and that's for 3/30 day.
