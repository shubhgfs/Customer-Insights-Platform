[5 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Y, yeah.

And so is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment? Was that a yes or no?

[10 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : No, no, that's no.
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : No, that's fine. So just with your smoking status. Also Lazaro, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Nope, that's good as a non spark of the premiums. They do work out to be cheaper and I just needed umm. Just to help determine how much cover that we can offer you. I'll provide you with a definition of pre tax income but just confirming with the employment status. Are you currently employed or self-employed?
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : No, Yep, I'm self-employed. I'm the owner of the company.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Self-employed, Yep. Then with being self-employed, pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly through to your own personal. If it's list any business expenses and excluding super contributions, This is the amounts, uh, that the business would otherwise cease earning in the event you were unable to work to to a disability. So what is your annual pre tax income? Uh, bizarre. It's around 100,000, so 100,000 around, Yeah. Yeah. So you're happy for me to note that down as 100,000 as your annual income before tax?

[12 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Uh, we just, uh, notice, just, uh, to be able to determine how much cover that we can offer to you.
[12 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[12 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So you can obviously choose which, which amount of cover suits you. Umm, but yeah, it's obviously determine how much cover that we can offer. We do need to note down your annual income, uh, before tax.
[12 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, OK, alright.
[12 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So I'll just confirm was at $100,000. Is that correct?
[12 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, around this.
[12 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so based off your and your, your duties and income, we can select A benefits amount from $1000 up to the maximum of $5833. What what, umm, what amount would you like me to quote you on that?
[12 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : It's a, it's a this a month, a week, a monthly. I don't know, Let's say five.
[12 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : That's also that's the monthly, uh, benefit amount, uh, let's say 55000.
[12 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[12 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine. And we can play around with the benefit amount if need be as well. But you also have the options to select different waiting periods and benefit periods also depending on your circumstances. So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. And you can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. But which, which waiting period would you like me to quote you on there? So you could do 30 days or 90 days.
[13 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : I don't know. It's, it's make a like a lot of difference in the.
[13 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So the the shorter the waiting period, the the more premiums you pay and then the longer the waiting period, the the less of the premiums.
[13 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I think can be the long one.
[13 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I think it can be the long one. OK, so the 90 day waiting.
[13 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : That's all right, Yeah.
[13 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And then you've got a benefit. Which is the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. Uh, with that you can choose six months, one year, two years or five years. The longer the benefit. The more premiums and then the lesser the benefit. The the lesser the premiums. Yeah, let's say a year, a year, Sure.
[14 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, let's say a year and and see how it goes. Yeah, if it's possible you change like you check for me later, like how much it is like a six month and a year, you know what I mean?
[14 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So if you're looking at the possible you change like you check like it is like a six month and eight, you know what I mean.
[14 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : How much I will pay for six months or how much I will pay for the year would be great. Yeah.
[14 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : That's what I'll give you the price differences there for you otherwise.
[14 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm. How much? Pardon.
[14 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So if you were to look at say the benefit period of say one year waiting period of 90 days with the monthly benefit amount at 90 days, you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $37.79, $37.79 a fortnight. So that covers you for the monthly benefit amount of $5000 with the waiting period at 90 days and a benefit period of one year. OK, OK.
[14 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : OK, alright, OK, no worries.
[14 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : But did you want me to make any adjustments to any of those or you happy to leave that as it is? Let's let's, let's like this.
[15 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : No, let's let's leave like this. So it's possible you send me this through the e-mail like I would like to show this for the for my clients.

[15 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Hmm.
[15 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : If this solves what they need, you know what I mean?
[15 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So what they need, you know what I mean? Yeah, that's fine. I can see that all out to you. So you can speak something. Hmm.
[15 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Or, or if I have to change, uh, something and then, yeah. And then we continue.
[15 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : And then and, and then we continue. Yeah, that's fine. I can see that all out. So you can do all of that. Uh, was there anything that you're unsure about the cover that I can clarify for you over the phone though? I don't, sorry.
[15 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Like, pardon, sorry, I couldn't hear you properly.
[15 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So was there anything about the cover that I can clarify over the phone for you?
[15 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Uh, no, I think, I think it's OK. I think it's OK.
[15 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK. And look, just to let you know, just to make sure that you're fully aware of how the policy does work. So as part of your income protection cover, all of us, we've also included in your policy and no extra cost a rehabilitation benefit along with a final expenses benefit, which pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away to assist with funeral costs or other final expenses. OK.
[16 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK, good.
[16 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : And your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. But as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $40.32 per fortnight. OK.
[16 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK, 4040.
[16 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : But you can also find, no, sorry, you got it.
[16 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, no. So forty, $40 per fortnight.
[16 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : That's right. That's so, yeah, that's, that's an indication that'll be $40.32 a fortnight assuming that you don't make any changes to the policy. So that's what your premium will be in the next year as an indication.
[16 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[16 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[16 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep.
[16 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So $40.32 a fortnight. But you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. But is that, is that all made sense, Lazar, so far?
[16 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh huh.
[16 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because, umm, once you've actually held this policy with us, what's 12 months? We do have a reward. So following your first policy anniversary date, we'll be refunding your back 10% of the premiums that you've paid to us in that time, which would be $98.26.

And umm, the final, but the final process will determine on the outcome of these questions as well. Because the last thing that we want you to have to do is ours. Obviously spend all that time speaking to your clients and they call us back to go through the applications to find out about any further changes. OK. But it shouldn't take any more than a couple of minutes. It's only yes or no questions apart from your hiding weight. Is it OK to quickly go through that with you now? Yeah.
