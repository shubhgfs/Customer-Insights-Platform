[59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Did I say it right?
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Right.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : That's good. Are you Greek?
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Uh huh. Good guess.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : You.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : And no, no, I'm Australian, but I'm a little bit older. I'm 63. So.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : That's alright. That's alright, Yeah.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : But I, I know some Greek people, so I, I love the souvlaki.
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Uh, you're actually like that.
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : I do love so lucky. All right. And umm, your date of birth, the 29th, sorry, 22nd of the 9th to umm, 1957.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yep, thank, thank you. And are you a male Australian resident as well, Spiros, thank you. So let's have a look together. Umm, what we've done is we've developed a life insurance for our seniors so that you can have it in your senior years just to leave something behind for your family to tidy everything up for you.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Alright, yes, Alright, yeah.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and with this particular policy, you could have some different medical conditions and still be eligible for this one because there's only 8 questions that we've designed. We're seeing is in mind, of course. And also if your death with you to an accident, your family will receive triple the benefit amount. So I wanted to ask you what prompted your inquiry about the cover though? What made you decide to look?
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Umm, As for some reason I get all I got couple of kids, you know, that's something new.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. OK. How old are your children?
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : When I died with nothing else in my name, I was yeah, 27 and 24.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Oh, lovely. I understand. Well, my daughter's 28, she's overseas at the moment.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Oh, you're very close.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : They grow up very quickly, don't they? So let's have a look for you. I'll show you how it works.
[2 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So the cover is designed to do that. It's a lump sum benefit. It's paid out if you were to unfortunately pass away before your 85th birthday. So, uh, when the sorry before your 85th birthday, when the policy ends. So it's giving your children, your, your loved ones financial protection. OK.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's all.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : And you can, yeah. And you can choose from 10,000 up to $200,000.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : But like I said, keep in mind, if your death was due to an accident, the benefit amount your loved ones receive will be tripled. So if you had a $50,000 policy, for instance, and your death with you to an accident, your family would get $150,000. OK.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's only an accident.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Accidental death, it's tripled.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Hi.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. Umm, also keep in mind that at the time of claim, your family can request an advance payment there 20% of the benefit amount first that comes out so they can look after your funeral and final expenses. We understand that not all families of course have that funding sitting and waiting, OK? It's also very easy to apply Spiros, because because we only ask you 8 questions in relation to your health, you can have a number of different medical conditions and still be eligible for this cover, OK?
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So once we look at those, if you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. Alright. Yep. And then also there's something on the cover for you. It's called a terminal advance payment. This is on the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to leave by a specialized medical practitioner will pay the claim in full to you instead. And that can assist you with your medical costs and allow you to get your fares in order etcetera.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yes, in 20. What's 24 months?
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, so let's say, I mean, I hope this never happens, Touchwood, if you have it, you can take advantage of the term legal advance payment. If you've got something like cancer that was terminal and if you were diagnosed with 24 months, like 2 years, so 24 months or less to leave by specialized medical practitioner, we'll pay the claim in full to you instead. Yeah, Yeah. So the are you understanding that? OK, now I was gonna ask you, do you have any questions for me at all before we look at some amounts for you?
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's the, what's the fish? Is it how much you have to buy a week or something?
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Oh, yeah. Let me look for you. Depends on the amount of cover.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, how?
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So let's have a look. Let's have a look.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : What is it, 200,000?
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, let's look. Can I ask you, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no? Yeah, that's OK. Let me look, so if you're looking now, you look can look from 200,000 down to 10,000, right? 200,000 would be $600,000 for your accidental debt. OK, Umm, that one comes in at $392.11. That's plus fortnight. Is that working within your budget or would you like to look at a different amount? Mm Hmm.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, yeah, uh, that's Fortnite 360,360 dollars.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : No, 392 and 11 cents. Yeah. Is that working or do you want me to look at a smaller amount?
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : That's look, that's too much. I am person.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : It's too much. OK. Oh, OK. Thank you for letting me know. Let's have a look because it is still tripled for your accidental debt. All right, let me see if we can get something that works for you. I'm going to go down to the 50,000 and see where that comes in. If you look at the 50,000, which is 150,000 for accidental debt, that would be $98.03 per fortnight. So that's under $50 a week. Would that one be more suitable for you or do you want me to lower it a little bit more?
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got a look at this. It's been there, you know.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : We'll look at this one and see if it's if you're eligible.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yes, I guess.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, alright, let's go.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Have a look at that and I think about them. I called you back, you know.
