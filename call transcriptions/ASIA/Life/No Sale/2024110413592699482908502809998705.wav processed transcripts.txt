[4 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : That would be correct. OK, perfect. Umm, it all depends on the pricing. If you do think the price wise is coming a little bit higher, I can blow out the benefit amount to find your suitable cover to spell.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yes, right.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK Umm, so to begin with the pricing, just a quick question to ask you that is in relation to your smoking. So have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?

[4 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sure.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So it does work out well for you, saving you some money to fill up with the policy premium. It's still loading up in the systems. My apologies. My system is lagging a little bit today. So in the meantime, what I'll do, I'll explain to you in terms of how the policy will work. OK, so one of the benefits you have with the policy if you live is called an accidental death benefit.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I understand that. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : I understand that, yes. So if you pass the right due to an accident, the $100,000 cover, it will umm become triple.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : 000. OK, that's fine. Yeah.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So it will convert to it will convert to 300 in a car accident or something like that.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : So if you appeared in a car accident or something like that, then it would triple. Yep.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : As long as the umm, the accidental death reason is not anything to self inflict self-inflicted injury.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. Yeah. Yep. Yep.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Like suppose, yeah, sure.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Understand. Understand. Yep.

[6 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 10,000 or something like that. And depending on what amount you go ahead with Phillips, suppose if you go ahead with $100,000, she can request to have the 20% of the benefit a man which comes out comes down to $20,000.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So she can request that as an advanced payment to help our guest through the immediate funeral cost or any other day-to-day cost while the rest of the money is getting prepared to be paid off to her.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Right. OK, I understand.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK and perfect. Thank you. In terms of the application process, I'll let you know quickly as well. Umm, the process is quite simple.

[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep. Yep.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : I'm glad that you do understand Sir, but I just have to run you through the quick information with you as well.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Sure, sure.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so with the policy there is also a living benefit included in the policy that is for the terminal E advance payment. That means that if you are diagnosed with 24 months or less to leave by a specialized medical practitioner, we're going to pay you the $100,000 amount in full.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So you can use the money while you're still alive towards your medical expenses or any other day-to-day expenses.
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : No, that's very good. Yep.
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Just making sure there is a difficult time arrives in your life you that that you can use that money to receive the best care possible.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Alright.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, but do you have any question, uh, for me if you would before I take you for the pricing?
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I'm, I'm a bit, I mean, before we go through the 8th questions, I'd be very interested to find out what the annual premium would be.
[7 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Very interesting to find out what the annual premium would be. Of course, This is why you're taking it through now, just to go through the pre premium to find your suitable policy. And if the premium does coming suitable, I'm going to take you through the same questions to confirm whether you're eligible or not.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, fine.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Thank you.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Uh, so you do go through annually the premium. Is that how you prefer? I wouldn't pay it annually. OK, All right. That's OK. I can do annually as well. Regardless of how do you pay your premium remains exactly the same throughout the year.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : I would pay an annual premium, Yes, Yep, sure. Does it increase annually the the premium?
[8 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, Umm, so for increase annually it does. I was going to go through the premium structure with you after giving you the pricing. I'll go to everything in details. OK, yes.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's how I think the key to it before we waste any more time is to find out what that first year premium is and then we can, if I'm still interested, then we can discuss further.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Exactly.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : I think 'cause we we could spend quite a few hours talking about some that that I and then in, in quarter of an hours time you tell me the premium and then I tell you I'm not interested.
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : It's been quite a few hours talking about now.
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : So I think the first thing to do would be to tell me the first year's premium.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for letting me know. I was going to go through the pricing. As I said, there was a bit of system issue. Now I got the pricing in the system, I can quickly let you know $400,000 your annual premium is $7977.87.
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Right, OK, so let's say 8 there. So what will it be in the second year?
[9 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Second year I can let you know as well. So your premium is kept, which means it will increase each year.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep. So basically it's it's what they term term life insurance. Is that correct?
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so as an indication, is that correct? This is a life insurance.
[9 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sure, sure. Yeah, I realise that. Yep. OK.
[9 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So the policy, umm, so if you have to pass away before your 85th, but the when the policy ends, So if the policy will cover you from 76 up until 85 and I'll give you the premium, umm, information about the next year as well.
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So you have some idea.
[10 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : That, that, that that would be interesting.
[10 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. As an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be 8000 $536.32.
[10 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK. OK.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : And I can go, yes, yes.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : So basically Bas basically just looking just very quickly doing some sums in my head, by the time I turn 85, I would have paid out more than $100,000, is that correct?
[10 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Umm, by the time I turned 85, I would have paid the umm.
[10 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. No, no. Well, thank.
[10 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : There is a chance that you might be paying more than the benefit amount depending on how much you are receiving.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Thanks.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Umm, Philly, the purpose of Yeah.
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Thanks very much.

[11 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for your time as well.
[11 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK. No, not not, not really.

[11 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : No, no, thank you.
[11 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Did you?
[11 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : No, I, I, I can, I'm, I'm an ex accountant, so I know how, how things work. So no, I'm, I'm fine. Thank you.
