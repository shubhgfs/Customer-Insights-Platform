[3 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK Yeah.

[3 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So basically the seniors life insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when this policy ends.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now with us, you can choose between $10,000 up to $200,000 cover.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : And to apply for the cover, we ask you 8 questions relating to health.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Now if you are accepted with these eight questions, and once you've decided to commence the policy, what we do then is that we will cover you immediately for death due to any cause. And the only thing that's not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months, OK?
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK.
[4 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : We also give you a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover as well. And what this means is that if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, then we compare the claim directly to you in full, OK? So while you're living, you can use your own life insurance in that event to support your medical expenses and ensure that you receive the best care possible. OK.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : The policy will also include accident cover, uh, Tucson. So if your death, God forbid, is due to an accident like a car accident, then your chosen benefit amount will triple.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK. And lastly, we provide a funeral benefit as well. So how this funeral benefit works is that at the time of your passing, if you're beneficiaries, if they don't have any funds to help cover the cost of your funeral, they can request an advance payout of 20% of your benefit amount to help with your funeral and final expenses as well. OK, so those are the benefits of our seniors life insurance policy. Do you have any questions on the benefits?
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : OK, sorry.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Again, do you have any questions about the benefits of ex of this explained to you?

[10 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, So at the moment what I want to make sure is what are you, what are you looking at life insurance for? Is it just to leave your money to your wife or children?

[11 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, so here in the Australian seniors, we understand that, you know, you wanna, uh, provide protection for your beneficiaries, but we also wanna make sure the cover is affordable for you and suitable for you. Because if you're on a pension, we understand the funds that you get from the pension is not much. OK? Now you have other bills to pay for other expenses. And if you pay, you know, something that's not in your budget, then you're the one who's going to, you know, be affected at the end of the day.
[11 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[11 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, so when you consider the quote that you've requested at $30,162.81 per month, which roughly is about $75 a fortnight, do you feel like that is affordable for you or do you wanna look at the low? I can only bring out bring down the price by bringing down the color. OK, So if you look at 30, sorry, $20,000 cover then monthly that's $108.54 per month for 20,000. There's no 25,000, there's only 1020, Thirty 4050 all the way up to 200,000. There's no, there's no amount for us to select here.
[12 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : And there is no 25,000 amount you you can you can make exception now 25,000 now because 2025 thousand 25,000 my wife as well is going to take life influence.
[12 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : It's only well, I wish I could give you 25,000, but I don't have the option here for 25,000. It's only 10,020 thousand 30,000.
[12 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So this and you let me know how does 20,000 sound to you? Is that more affordable for you?
[13 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : It's more affordable, but, uh, you know, I always can, uh, but, you know, every thousand is better. Yeah.
[13 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : It is better, yeah. Again, it's up to you, right.
[13 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : I mean, this, this always thinking about the, about the, you know, a down value of money, you know what I mean?
[13 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Well, remember to send the price again. I I do apologize. I want to retract the statement of it is better.
[13 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : That is all this means, you know, Oh, what is, what is your yeah. What is your name? Uh, uh, just wanted to know in, in the case, uh, if I change the mind, you know, I will call you back.
[13 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : I want to mention that's fine because my name is AJ from the Australian Seniors. Now can I ask you a question? You called yesterday, you've called a couple of weeks ago. You cons.
[13 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah yeah. I always, I always when I find, I think it's not, it's making different, uh, different, you know, it's not the same.
[14 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Why? Why do you?
[14 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : That is why so sorry, you know, because I, I thought this is a couple of times.
[14 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Why do you feel that it will be different? But why? Why? Why do you think that it's different?
[14 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I thought it different, you know, but they different to make the quote maybe affordable quote for someone else. That is why. That is why.
[14 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Well, well, if the cover doesn't change every day, you know what I mean. It's the same cover. The price, the amounts are still gonna be the based off your age, gender, smoking status and level of cover you choose. If you call tomorrow, it's still gonna be the same. Does that make sense? Yeah. So. Well, the price will only go higher and higher if you call after your, you know, as you're getting older and older, it doesn't reduce. It's not like car insurance, it's not like home insurance. This is a life insurance. So life insurance is different to the other insurances that you're possibly looking at.
[14 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, No, no, I mean, I, I, I, I mean, always said that it's not that there's some different field or some different, you know, Yeah, yeah.
[15 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, now you know, I gotta, I gotta clarify Now this policy, you know, if you feel like the 30,000 is what you want but you can't afford it. So if 20,000 is sounding affordable for you, this policy is flexible. So for example, if you wanna start a fund, a level of cover that is affordable at least and it gives you the Peace of Mind you have something in place in the future. If you can afford more, you can give us a ring and apply for a separate pop up policy subject to eligibility and you can increase your cover. And you can do that as long as the total that you have with us does not increase about $200,000. OK. So at the moment if you don't have, do you have any life insurance at the moment or any kind of protection at the moment for your family, you don't have anything?
[15 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, no. I haven't got any.
[15 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : You don't have anything.
[15 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't have. I don't have any. Yeah, I don't have any.
[15 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Well, you're approved for cover, yes Yeah. So keep in mind you are eligible for cover. We don't really get a lot of people who are eligible because not everyone is healthy, you know what I mean?
[16 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. No, I thought that.
[16 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Some people can umm, you know, based off those questions that, you know, some people can be declined and those questions they don't like, you know, for example, next month you may get a ha, God forbid, a card attack or cancer or something. You just never know what's gonna happen.
[16 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[16 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So at the moment you are eligible for cover and you are able to take out life insurance. I don't know what is going to happen in six months time or one year's time to your health, uh, or anything. We can't, we can't determine that, right. So if you're eligible and if you feel like the 20,000 is standing affordable, how about we send you the, the policy documents for the 20,000. You can sit down with your family, review that, see if it is affordable and suitable, and then if you're happy with it, you can continue that one.
[16 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Every, No, I am happy with that and about explanation, I understood every, I understood everything, you know, So I just wanted to, to tell you, give me, give me, give me a couple of days. I will talk with my wife. I got your, uh, number and then I will call you back, you know, because I'm 100% interest about life insurance that I have to take to apply, as I say, to protect my father, family of the international problems, you know what I mean?
[17 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. Again.
[17 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : In the case when it comes death or, or, or illness or or something, you know, yeah, give me, give me, give us, give us, give us a couple of days. I will speak with my wife and we will consider all that stuff and we will decide which amount and, and and and they will call you back, you know.

[17 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : No, won't be, won't be long. Won't be long. Won't be long. No, no, no, won't be long.
[17 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : You've been trying to, you know, speak to us and you, yeah, uh, again, I'm just, I'm just confused to why it's, uh, why you're constantly, you know, you know, asking for the same amount, same price for the last few months.
[18 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[18 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : I just wanna help you as best as I can to understand what the situation is. Umm, C can I ask you, you know, Y you know, is the cover the C the I understand the price may be a concerned, but do you, do you not understand that this cover or the, the, the health questions, you know, it's, it's all approved for you at the moment. So what I can do is we can send you your documents instead of a quote and the PDS, we can send you your actual policy documents. You can sit down with your wife and review it while you're protected with us. You don't need to stop paying for the cover. AIA, that's an insurance company. Yeah.

[19 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : That's fine with our policy, it's eligible.
[19 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : But yeah, but I am not I I am not anymore in ambition, you know, that means no Hoskin lymphoma skewed, you know, and they, they, they say, ah, no, that is umm, you don't know the blah, blah, blah, you know, and they declined, declined, you know, and This is why I always thinking maybe I find find another company, you know, uh, for $107.00 for 110, even $120.00 if it's 120 monthly, I will take it and 3030 thousand amount. And why I already insisted on 30,000 and 50 just because of the value of money, you know what I mean?
