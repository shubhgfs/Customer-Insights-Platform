[59 seconds][Agent] : Also, thank you for that. And I just need to let you know as well, umm, that calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general in nature and then I'll be suitable to your situation. So great. Just so I can help you a little bit better here, umm, and so I can have a better understanding of what sparked your interest as well. Are you new to life insurance or do you kind of have some cover in place?
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : No, I haven't got any insight.
[1 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : I just thought, no, I don't push it.
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK. And what's prompted your inquiry?
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : We're gonna die, aren't we?
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, it is. It is a tough dis umm, discussion to have, but that's the reality, isn't it? So what I'll do for you today, Craig, is I'll explain the main features and benefits and just run through some pricing with you as well. So if you haven't got anything in place, like you mentioned, umm, what seniors life insurance is designed for is to provide that financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. So you can choose cover between 10,000 up to 200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive that benefit amount as well. OK. And what includes since policy Craig, is that if this is due to an accident, your choice and benefit will triple. And we also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount as well to help with funeral cost or any other final expenses at the time. And so it's easy to apply. We do ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone just to see if you're approved and if you are accepted. And once you commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK. And in addition as well, there is a terminal ill, ill advanced payment included in the cover. So what that means is if you are diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can pay your benefit amount in full to help with medical costs, uh, just to ensure that you receive the best care possible. I just wanted to check in with you, Craig. Do you have any questions for me at all? Just with what I've told you so far? Yeah.
[3 minutes][Customer] : No, it seems OK.
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. All pretty straightforward.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. So let's get through a quite together. But to begin with, I just need to ask you a question relating to your smoking status. So have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[3 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No, no.

[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's a nice place.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, Of course. Awesome. So let's just have a look at this. Lights up. Awesome. So for $100,000 of cover for you, Craig, at the moment, without going through the questions, it's coming up to be a fortnightly premium of $145.78. So that's every two weeks. How's that sounding to you in terms of suitability or did you want to look at any other levels of cover? 50,000 of course. And of course, I'm, I'm more than happy to look at different levels of cover, see what works for you as well. Umm, so for 50,000, that's coming up to a $4.00 premium of $72.89.
