[11 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[12 seconds][Agent] : Hey, good morning, Margaret. My name's David. I'm calling from Australian Seniors. How are you today?
[17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm good. Thank you.
[18 seconds][Agent] : That's good to hear. Well, the reason for my call today, Margaret, it's just in regards to that life insurance inquiry they received online.
[25 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[24 seconds][Agent] : So I'm happy to help you out with that today.
[27 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[26 seconds][Agent] : I just wanted to confirm that I've got the right details here. First and foremost, am I speaking with Margaret Stroud?
[33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[34 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful and date of birth that I've got here for yourself, Margaret, 6th of the 5th 1961, is that correct? Beautiful. And last thing I just wanted to confirm is that you're a female Australian resident.
[40 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I am.
[47 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful and just wanted to let you know as well that calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. Now, just for my better understanding as well for your own situation, Margaret, is this your first time looking into life insurance?
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No, I did look into it. Oh, a long time ago, but I I never ended up doing anything. Yeah.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, well look what I'll do for you today is I'll explain the main features and benefits with our product care, of course, and then provide some pricing to you as well along the way. But what are you wanting to get out of this life insurance at the end of the day? Was it more so to provide protection for your loved ones? OK, beautiful. And who would that be for yourself?
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I have got five children. Yes, yes.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Five children, beautiful, all grown up or still running around the house.
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Oh no, too old to have a young one.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, fair enough. Well, look, age is just a number, I guess at, at some stage. My, my mom is quite old as well, uh, for her age to have kids. Uh, yeah, like hasn't been, uh, a long time since I was just running around the house as well myself. But yeah, with, with our life insurance, of course, uh, market, uh, it's designed to provide that financial protection for your loved ones. And that's done through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. OK. And the reason I ask you, in regards to your beneficiaries or, or who you would want to leave this money behind to, you can actually nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive that nominated benefit amount and you can choose cover.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : There we go. We have 5.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. It's just the right one. No one left out. Umm, And you can choose cover between $10,000 all the way up to $200,000, which is our top level of cover.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. I was looking at the custom.
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Umm, yeah, of course. Uh, the top level of cover, of course is, is a main driving point in price as well, as well as age, time of application and a couple of different factors as well. Uh, but with this covered here, Margaret, there's, uh, a feature built in, which means that if your death was due to an accident, uh, what will happen is your chosen benefit will triple. And we also include an advance payment of 20% to your loved ones, uh, of the benefit amount to help with things like immediate funeral costs or any of their final expenses at the time while your claim is getting processed. Does that make sense?
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I do have funeral cover though.
[3 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah. Well, either way, that does get paid out in that time if, uh, if your death was due to an accident.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Awesome.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : That, that might just be extra support for your children that, that, you know, of course, difficult time of breathing.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and it's easy to apply with us here, Margaret. We don't send you out on umm, you know, any doctor's check or anything like that. We just ask you 8 yes, Sir, no questions, just relating to your health over the phone to see if you are approved. And if you are accepted, and once you do decide to commence the policy, what you'll be covered for is, uh, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. So that's the only waiting period that we have to serve. In addition as well there, Margaret, there is a terminally ill advanced payment that's included in the cover. And what that means is if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner and that unfortunate instance there, Margaret, would you pay out the claim to yourself in full to help you with things like medical costs and of course, with your five children to plan out for the future as well? Yep. Yeah. How's that sounding so far to you?
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Good.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Sorry.
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : OK, good. OK. Yeah.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's great to hear. Umm, but did you have any questions about the cover itself? Beautiful. So let's get through some pricing then. Uh, So what I'm here to do for yourself there Margaret, is find something that's affordable and suitable just to have something to leave behind for your loved ones and your children as well, of course. Umm, but let's load this one up. OK, Sorry, it's just taking its time. And what's your preferred title there, Margaret?
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Is it miss, uh, miss or misses?
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Anything. I don't care.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, we go with miss.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Hello.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. OK, I'll just slide this one out. So it's just taking a sweet time there today. Margaret, how's your morning so far?
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, nothing. Quiet.
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Pretty quiet, beautiful.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, grandchild after school and that's quiet.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Oh, you've got grandchildren as well. How many?
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, I have 5 all up, but I have one that lives with me because I'm his mother's carer, because she was in a car accident.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, I'm sorry to hear about that.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : So I look after her and him.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, must keep you busy then.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Oh yes.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : That's the one. Umm, but with this one here, umm, I just need to ask you first. It's just in relation to your smoking status. So have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : I'm rolling on right now.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, Umm, so just for compliance purpose, uh, the, we do need to have a clear yes or no, uh, for these questions. So, yeah, would there be a yes for that, uh, question?
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Thank you. Uh, and for the top level of cover, of course, uh, if you're looking at the top level of cover, that means we've got a lot of room to play uh, around in terms of, uh, discover. It does start from 10,000 and then goes in increments of $10,000. But for that top level of cover for yourself there, Margaret, it is coming up as a fortnightly premium of $264.28. So that's every two weeks. How's that sounding to you?
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : It's getting a bit expensive.
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, and that's fair enough. Did you want to look at, uh, lower levels of cover at all to just have something to, umm, maybe compare with, uh, did you want to see that on a monthly basis?
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : If you get that 200 to monthly, that'd be good, yeah.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So with this, umm, with this calculator that we have here, Margaret, it does work out to be the same if you pay for it only or monthly or annually over the course of the year. But, umm, a lot of people assume that if you do fortnightly, then you just double it and it's monthly, but there is a few extra days in there. So for a monthly premium that's $572.61. And that's if you decide to pay on a monthly basis. Yeah.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Well, it it sounds like a lot, doesn't it?
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Well, I'm, like I mentioned to you, we do have lots of room to play if you want to look at something, uh, affordable for yourself. And with that cover here as well, Margaret, we are quite flexible in being able to apply for a top up cover later in the future, of course, subject to waiting periods and, uh, eligibility at that time as well. Umm, and if you did find that the price is a bit higher for you, umm, down the line as well, it's also flexible in a way where you can just give us a call and apply to have that decreased as well. Bring your premiums down as well. Umm, and find something affordable for yourself as well. OK, sorry.
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : How does the average senior afford that? How would the average senior afford that?
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Look, I understand. Umm, this is our top level of cover, which is 200,000. Umm, so we try to find something affordable, uh, for for every person situation, of course. And I understand like, you know, being a senior might be hopping on the pension soon or something like that. Everyone's got their own different situations. Uh, but with our pricing here, it is coming up as, uh, $572.61 for $200,000 of cover. Yeah, yeah. Did you want to look at any other levels of cover there, Margaret? Yeah, of course. No worries. Yeah, Well, look, we can, Yeah, of course we can go through the, umm, the questions, uh, very quickly for yourself. I'll just bring this up for yourself. Uh, Yep.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : OK, I don't know whether I would be accepted first I think because I and then I can think about think about the thing 'cause I got got knocked back by insurance line way back, way, way, way back when.
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Oh, OK.
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : I fir like what I mentioned to you when I had tried to get it ages ago, but I think because of my history they decided no. But now we're we're like 10-10 years down the track.
[9 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sorry, were you declined due to like some health conditions with insurance line?
[9 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Not so much health conditions.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. Yeah. Well, look, these questions are mm, hmm.
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : It's what I've done in the past Yeah, because I, I don't have any health conditions at the moment, but I have a little bit of high blood pressure.
[9 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : But just given my age, this, this normal. But see, I have a history of drugs which so long ago now, but we'll go back to 2006.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, OK.
[9 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : See, it was not, I think it was about 2009 when when I tried to go for life insurance A and because of my, my drug history, they decided no.
[10 minutes][Agent] : OK. OK. Yeah, of course.
[9 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : But now like we're now in 2024 and my drug history is way back there.
[10 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Well, look, we can have a look if you can be approved for our cover here. Of course, every, umm, insurance provider is going to be different in terms of their underwriting and the questions that the underwriters want to ask the customers before approving them for cover.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Alright then.
[10 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So let's just get through those ones just to make sure that we can be approved for the time in the 1st place and then we'll find something suitable for yourself. OK. Umm, but the first one is just in relation to umm, COVID-19 there. So have you been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the last six months or have you been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last seven days?

Like I mentioned, we are quite flexible here at Australian Seniors where you can, you know, apply for those top up level covers or decrease the cover if you'd like somewhere in the future. Umm, what? What would be an affordable budget for yourself at this stage?
