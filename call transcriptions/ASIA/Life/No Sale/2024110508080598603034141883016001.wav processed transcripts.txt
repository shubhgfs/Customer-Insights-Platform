[4 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Well, I'd probably prefer to go into the when 'cause when you sort of look at it, I mean, I, I think I'd probably rather starting the. You're better off starting at the 200 and then we'll go from there.

[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, so Richard, uh, for, uh, $200,000 worth of cover, umm, you are looking at a payment of $113.07 per fortnight. Umm, how is that sounding in terms of suitability?
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think I yeah, that's fine. I mean, as I said, it's not it is. It is what it is. So yeah.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. And were you looking at any other levels of cover or is that something that's satisfying for you?

[5 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : But it'll help pay off whatever bills or whatever. And and just to to make them, yeah.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : And at the end, yeah, exactly right. So, umm, like I did, like I did say earlier it it's not really for us, uh, for the future and making sure that all grounds are covered right.
