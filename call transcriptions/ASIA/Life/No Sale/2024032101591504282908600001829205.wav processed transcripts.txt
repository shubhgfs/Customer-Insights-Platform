[2 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So our sales life insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones to a lump sum payment if you would have passed away before. When the policy ends, you can choose cover between $10,000 up to $200,000 and normally up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount. And if that is due to an accident, your chosen benefits will triple. And we also include advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with fuel costs or any other fine expenses at the time. It's easy to apply. We just ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you're approved. If you accept it and once you stop the policy, you will be covered immediately for that due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. In addition, there is a terminally in advance payment including the color if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less than this by a specialized medical practitioner, we can pay a benefit amount in full to help them out the cost to ensure you see the best care possible. So by do you have any questions for me so far in regards to the OK, that's fine. So what we can do now is go through the quote together. I do need to ask, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
