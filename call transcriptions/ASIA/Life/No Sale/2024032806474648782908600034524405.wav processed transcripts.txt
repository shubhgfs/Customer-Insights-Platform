[6 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : That's good, Very, very good. I'm just, it's just Jaron, I'm on some of those heads at the moment. That's maybe why there's a bit of confusion there. So we've got a bit of a tricky 1 the it's an after hours call back for sales, even though it's not, that wasn't the case at all. We've got Gary on the line and he's just ringing up in regards to his mum's policy.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, Yeah, OK.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So there's no like no profiles actually showing up about, you know, her active pulse, anything like that. So I just thought it's probably best just to bring him through the support. That way you can do a search.
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no problem.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : He wanted to update some details because she has dementia that. Yeah. So she's got dementia, I think, and he just wanted to update some details. I'll just check on it. But I don't know if he's got TPA. So that's why, yeah, look, it's very, very vague information. We've at least confirmed her name is Bridget Henderson and her date of birth. I'll just actually hopped out of the lead for you now. I'll actually just close it, sorry, and then hop out of it. You'll be able to jump in that, I hope.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : It's just ringing up as a like a quote back at then if I forgot the policy from my end, I'm SH.
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : I'm just having a look. I'm just gonna search your details. OK, Yeah, I've found the other one. That's fine.
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Oh, beautiful. OK. Yeah. So his name. Yeah. Gary. We've confirmed his name is Gary Henderson. His date of birth as well. But I I don't know how we can transfer if I just tell you or.
