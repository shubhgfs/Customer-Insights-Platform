[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 15/11/82, that's the one.
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Lovely. And jumping into the funeral insurance, as I can see you're looking at some funeral insurance for your mom, just getting some cover back in place for her. Was this as I can see she previously had some cover in place or were you looking back into getting the cover, same protection place for her? Yeah, same one.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yes, same one.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no problem. And for the level of cover, so you're able to look at amounts from $3000 up to 15,000 for your mom and she'll be able to nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the benefit amount. So if she's looking at noting you down as that beneficiary when she receives the hard copy documents, she just has to fill it out with your details and send it back to us. That way we have it on file for you when you make a claim on the policy. But if you know she has any issues with filling out the form, you can give us a ring and she's able to nominate you as a beneficiary or anybody else over the phone with our support team's assistance. OK.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : That's no, no problems.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Oh good. Also, just to let you know, it does include an accidental death component for your mom. So that will be if she were to unfortunately pass away due to an accident, we will then triple her benefit amount. And would you just let you know for the 1st 12 months? So your mom will be covered for accidental death only after the first 12 months? She will be covered for death due to any cause. In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding her policy for 12 months, if she was first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we would then pay the claim out to her while she's still living. Up to you while she she's still living to use towards any medical costs or other expenses at that time as well.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : No problems.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, lovely. And any questions so far?
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : No, not yet.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : No, not yet. Yep, that's all good. All good. What we can do then is look into some pricing, see what levels looking most suitable to have in place for your mom. Umm, for the benefit amount it does range from the 3000 up to 15 I think you put with inquiry for the 15,000 you're looking at.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yes, yes of course, no problem. So for the $15,000 benefit amount you would be looking at a fortnightly premium of $160.75 per fortnight. We do also send you out a free online legal bill which is valued at $160.00 if she wants to get that organized and a complimentary subscription of the Dare magazine. But were you happy with that $15,000 benefit amount you have in place for you mom?
[6 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I can. I can afford that.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yes of course, no problem as long as that's suited towards your needs. Also just to let you know as well, Lua would be premiums. So your premiums, they are level, that means they're designed to stay the same as your mom gets older and when she reaches age 85, so you will no longer have to pay anything else as that's when the premiums will cease. So they'll stop the whole policy will still continue after age 85, and she'll also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover, which is going to be added to the benefit amount you've selected. And you can also find information about our premium structure and how it works on our website. Umm, also, if circumstances do change for you or your mom, you're also able to claim on our early cash out option when she reaches age 85. So that's if you're looking at ending the cover and we would be able to pay you out 75% of the funeral insurance benefit amount you've selected. So it just depends on what you'd like to do at that time, of course. OK, no problem.
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : OK, no problems.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Lovely. And just to also lastly let you know that you may pay more internal premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. So please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you want to cancel outside of the 30 days, that is when your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back unless you are eligible for and choose the early cash back offer. But what we can do then is just go ahead and getting that cover in place for your mom. And I'll just reconfirm with you as well. Lua, I have the address on the policy. There is a previous address, Dunblane Drive. Was that the correct one?
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's still the same address.
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yep, no problem. So it was 10 Dunblane Dr. Boronia Heights QLD 4124. That's the one. Yep. And home and postal address also, still the same, correct?

[9 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I do.

So to her e-mail, to your e-mail address within the next 15 or so minutes. And then the hard copy documents, you should receive it within the next three to five business days whilst you're also reviewing those documents. You do. This policy does also provide you with a 30 day cooling off. So that's if you decide it's not suitable, all you would have to do is just give us a ring back to cancel within the 30 days and you'll also receive a full refund of your premium unless the claim has been made. All we do now is just noting down your preferred payment date and the payment method you'd like us to note. But when would you like the first payment to start from?
