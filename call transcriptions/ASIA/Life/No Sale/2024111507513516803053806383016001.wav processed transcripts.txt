[4 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So your so on your 85th birthday the policy ends, Yes.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : So if I lived to 86, then I've just wasted all my money. Yeah, well, once I once I'm 86 or 87, then I don't have any more cover. Right.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So if you're asking what would happen if you lived beyond age, Yep, I can definitely get that. I'll read from the PDS for you.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So cover for the life insured will end on any of the earliest of the following events on the on your 85th birthday, the date of your death, the date of payment of a terminal illness claim or the date you cancel the policy or we cancel the policy. OK, yeah, sure.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep. So it's a bit of a negative G, I'm gambling and I'm going to die before 85. That's what you're saying. So it's a bit of, a bit of a negative, a bit of a negative investment, to be honest.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So what I can do is so it is, yes.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : I like to think I I like to think I live a little longer than 85. I'm I'm still working, still active.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So your policy does Mm, hmm, mm, hmm. Mm, hmm.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : I'm still, I don't take any medication, no smoke, don't drink.
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Mm, hmm.
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : So I'm I'm going to gamble.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm going to live beyond 85, OK, Which means, which means the policy is no use to me. So that means, so that means no sale. OK, So, so, so, so scratch me off the list. OK, I'm, I'm, I'm going to, I'm going to chance it. I'm I'm confident. So I'm going to keep going.

[7 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no point because I'll pay premiums in for say nine years and if I don't pass away, then there's no benefit to me for that investment. I'm better off putting that money into buying silver or something. At least I'm going to still have it at the end.
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Mm, hmm.
