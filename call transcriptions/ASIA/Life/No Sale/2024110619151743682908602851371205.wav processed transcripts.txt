[8 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : UH-100 and 64 per week. It's probably a little bit more than I anticipated. So.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Would that be manageable and suitable to yourself anticipated? OK.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Mm, Hmm.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : What I can do, I can reduce the level of cover to say $100,000, just just to give you an example.
[9 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Yeah, of course. Read $100,000 policy fortnight. You're coming up at 318 dollars. My apologies.

[9 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Right, Right.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Is that coming better and manageable, this one?
[9 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yeah, it's probably a bit more manageable. Yes.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'm glad to hear that. So Craig, I'll let you know. In terms of how the premium will calculate, your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year. OK, So I can give you an example. I have the calculator in front of me. So this year your premium is $218.77, right?
[9 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. That's it. Mm hmm. All right.
[9 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : And, and as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $234.08 a fortnight and your benefit amount locked in. There is no CPA increase or anything involved. So it remains exactly the same as uh, that you're currently insured for. OK, Uh, if you do require more information, Craig uh, you can also find information about your premium structure on our website, OK.
[10 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : All right. Just so you, so you've said it goes from 2:18 to 2:34 and after the the first year and the next year, what about the year after? What does it go to then? Right. OK. MM hmm.
[10 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : At 73, it goes $250.47 a fortnight, OK.
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK, right.
[10 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : And just to give you an example, at 74 it goes up to $268, OK, Yes, sure. With the cover is belt Craig, it is a very flexible cover. So in the future if you do think that is getting expensive for you, all you can do is call us and apply to have it reduced at your suitable and affordable cover. OK.
[10 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[10 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : But at the moment for the $100,000 cover the with the fortnight $218.77, are you happy with that? Sure, definitely more than happy to send you to.
[11 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I mean, I'll, I'll have to talk to my wife about it first, but maybe she doesn't, maybe she doesn't seem to think that we'll probably might not need $100,000 because I do have superannuation. It's paid out if I before I pass away. So I might look at, can you also just do, I'd say $50,000 just so I've got something to talk to my wife about.
[11 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course, uh, $50,000 coverage, uh, fortnightly $109.39.
[11 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Alright, alright. So it's that that's $54 per week.
[11 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So roughly say $54.69 a week.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : OK. Hmm. Mm.
[11 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK, So the reason I ask you, correct, whether $100,000, are you happy with that or not?
