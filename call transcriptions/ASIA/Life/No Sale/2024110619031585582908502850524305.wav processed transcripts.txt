[49 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[51 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. All right, thank you for that. Umm, just so I can have a better understanding of what sparked your interest today. Are you new to life insurance or do you currently have some cover in place?
[1 minutes][Customer] : I don't have a life insurance. I had one but I didn't care to follow up.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, so it's not currently in place anymore.
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : No.
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what I'll do is I'll explain the main features and benefits of our life insurance here at Australian Seniors Umm, but just note, if you are replacing an existing policy, we do recommend that you do not cancel that policy until your application has been approved and you have reviewed this policy as a new policy might not be identical to your existing cover. OK, so St. so Australian Seniors life insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday. When the policy ends, you can choose cover between $10,000 up to $200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the nominated nominated benefit amount. If that is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple and we'll also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time.
[2 minutes][Customer] : Can you repeat?
[2 minutes][Agent] : OK, it's yeah sure, sure that that just that last sentence. So if that's due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Can you repeat this one OK?
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and then come claims time. We also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with any funeral costs or any other expenses like that. OK, it's easy to apply. We just ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health and well-being over the phone to see if you're approved. OK, if you are approved and once you start the policy, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. In addition, now I hope this never does happen to you, but there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in our cover. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can pay your benefit amount in full to help with medical costs to ensure you receive the best care possible. OK, do you have any questions for me so far?
