We will just need to go through it that quickly. OK, alright, so just recapping everything, but I'm just gonna get so I can have a better understanding. You don't have any cover currently in place?
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : We want to cancel the Westpac one. My husband's plan to do that, I think this week.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : O OK. So I do need to let you know that if you are replacing an existing policy, we recommend that you do not cancel that policy until your application has been approved and you have reviewed this policy. As your new policy may not be identical to your existing cover.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : And you should also consider the benefits that may not apply or waiting periods that may start again now.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : This seniors life insurance is designed to provide that financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment. If you would have passed away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends now. If you are accepted and once you commence, the policy will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. And in addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can pay your benefit amount in full.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So, Marilyn, how is all that sounding? Sounding very familiar to you. Do you have any questions?
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, any other any questions?
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Sorry.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's all good. All right, let's stop me if you need to ask me any questions there.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : I'm just pulling up everything we need and confirming this address. The 12 Grassmere Court, Carawan, QLD 4817. Is that the current address?
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's it's actually pronounced Kerwin.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'm sorry. My Canadian accent. You can laugh at it.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : I thought I'd detected it and I think yeah.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'll still try after 10 years been trying to pronounce things, but it's I think that's forever. So now. And that's the same address as your postal address. OK, perfect. And we have here the phone number 0410215125. Is that best to reach you? OK. And I have an e-mail there, it's bobbonner51@icloud.com. Is that still valid?
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : It it is, yes, That's right, yes.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So just starting with this quote here. So have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : I've never smoked or drank alcohol in my life.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful. OK, perfect. I'll put that as a no there. Good on you there. And then from $10,000 and up to $200,000. Did you have a benefit amount in mind that you wanted to look at? Yeah, yeah, from $10,000 and up to $200,000. Yeah.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : What was the amount again from 10,000 to well, how much is it for say 180 and 1:50?
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : And for a huh, OK. So $180,000 to cover the premium will be $272.51, that's per fortnight.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes. Thank you.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : And then for you said 150,000 and then for 150,000, the cover would be $227.09 per fortnight.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Might get 150. Thanks.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now just loading up the application questions will run through. Just gonna start by reading you the pre underwriting disclosure. And also as this is a life insurance policy, your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, uh, your premium next year will be $242.99 or Fortnite. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. Any questions so far Maryland are all good still.
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Well how come you can umm because the office on the understanding that it does that according to the CPI, but no one that can envisage what the CPI will be next year.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So you mean for this insurance, so the premium is that which means it will increase each year. So I'll just pull up the the projection here again. So just here. Alright, so your premium is structured as a stepped premium. So this means the premium payable under the policy will generally increase each year. Generally as people age, the likelihood of them needing to claim on a life insurance policy will increase. So this increase in risk is factored into the prices that we charge. So that's the reason for the increase. Yeah, that your benefit amounts, it will stay the same at $150,000, that doesn't increase. Yeah, yeah, no worries.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : But if I want to, if like for instance, we did retire and oh, excuse me, I had a tickle, I've had it all day. If we found cost of living is going up more so which I think it will, can we reduce that 1:50 to say 1:20 or so?
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yep, of course. Yeah, once you start the cover umm and you commence the policy, you can apply to decrease the benefit amount. You just won't be able to increase this at a later date. However, you can apply to UMM, you can apply for a separate policy as like a top up policy if you wanna increase it. UMM subject to eligibility at the time of application and so long as it doesn't exceed the maximum benefit amount within the same brand for Australian seniors. Insurance of $200,000.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[8 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'm just loading up the questions here for us. This this will determine the eligibility factor. So this reads.
