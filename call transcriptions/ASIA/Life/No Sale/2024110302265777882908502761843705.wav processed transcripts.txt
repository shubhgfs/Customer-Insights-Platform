[10 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[12 seconds][Agent] : Hi Christine, it's Cindy calling from Australian Seniors.
[16 seconds][Customer] : Yes. Hi.
[16 seconds][Agent] : I'm giving you a call. Yep, I'm giving you a call due to your expression of interest online that you put in for life insurance. Yep. So I can assist you further, can I just confirm I'm speaking with Christine Coleman? Yep. And your birthday is the 6th of December 1958.
[23 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[36 seconds][Agent] : OK. Please note all calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general in nature and they will be suitable to your situation. Can I also confirm that you are an Australian resident, Christine?
[47 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[48 seconds][Agent] : OK perfect, so I can have a better understanding of your situation. What sparked your interest into life insurance?
[56 seconds][Customer] : Oh well, I've already got some. So I was just interested to see different quotes because I've been with this company for a few years now and it was and I joined by them doing some cold calling.
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : So I've never really shopped around and I'm going to be retiring at the end of the year, so I thought I might just start looking, see if I can find any cheaper products.
[1 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. So I can definitely help you, you know, look at some quotes today and the main features and benefits that we have. But we, we also do suggest if you are replacing an existing policy, we recommend that you do not cancel that policy until the application has been approved and you have reviewed this policy as a new policy may not be identical to existing cover. And also you should also consider the benefits that may not apply or waiting periods that may start again. OK. But like I said that Christine, I can definitely help you look at some options with us and then just go through what benefits that we provide for that cover.
[1 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, So seniors life insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday. When the policy ends, you can choose cover between $10,000 up to $200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the nominated benefit amount. If death is due to an accident, your choice and benefit will triple and we also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. OK, it's easy to apply. We just ask you a yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you are approved. OK. And if you are accepted and once you commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. And in addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to leave by specialized medical practitioner, we can pay your benefit amount in full to help with medical costs to ensure you receive the best care possible.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yes. OK.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, do you have any questions for me so far, Christine?
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : No, no, that's fine, Mrs.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : No, And do you go by Missus or Miss Missus? OK, so let's pull up some quotes for you there. And just before I do, I need to ask, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? No very healthy choice there.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't. I don't even drink tea or puffy.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, so oh wow, do you do you like having hot water on its own though? On like a cold night? No.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. OK, so keeping in mind the level of cover ranges from $10,000 up to $200,000 and of course we can look at different amounts until you find the right level of cover for yourself. So which one should I start with for you?
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Can you tell me around 500,000 cover?
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : 10,000 up to 200,000 100,000 OK, so for $100,000 of cover the premium is $100.88 per fortnight. Yeah. How does that sound for you there?
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK, that, that's more than I'm paying now. I'm I'm paying. I've got cover of 105,000 at the moment and it's 150 something a month.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, I I can put it down for you and have a look. What it do you, umm, sorry. Does your current policy cover the same things as this one does? Oh, no.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : I don't know about those extra things. Yeah, I'm not sure, but I've never really had a lot of paperwork. It's with Clearview and I think they were the company that was sort of looked into in the last couple of years about their practices they.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I see.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Because when I started it was a lot higher and it got up to over $500 a month in premiums and then I reduced it significantly because it the house will be paid out that you've seen. And I was just, and I've been speaking to someone else at work today about their cover and just got me thinking about and I am I paying more than I should think? I'm a senior. I have been for quite a while.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah. OK, umm, I can also say that Australian Seniors has, you know, a really good reputation as well, umm, as well as you know, umm, the claims being paid back on time and things like that.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : But But yeah, that that is, that is more, that's like $50.00 a month more than I'm paying at the moment, yeah.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : But like I mentioned, you know, you do have 5 beneficiaries, OK? So you can pick up to five people that they can be paid out. Umm, and also you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months, OK. And the terminally ill advanced payment is also quite important because we just don't know what can happen. And you know, it's just good to have that protection there. Umm, but but look, Christine, I can have a look at another level for you if you would like.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I didn't pay up amount.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, maybe 90,000.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : So yes, at the moment it was 105 for some reason.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, well.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : I didn't know how it got 105, but well, it'll, it'll probably still be more than I'm paying now for the the less P payout, won't it? I see. I don't know if the other policy has things like the funeral, 20%, the systems, that sort of thing. So I don't know if I'm comparing a similar product. That's the problem, isn't it? When you, you, you don't know what the other one is.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, did. Did the other?
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : I, I should contact them and just see what they do because I, yeah, it's been a while since I've done anything about it.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, did they, did they provide you with a PDF to have a look at?
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : If I did it was, it would have been a long time ago. So I think I'll pretty much only get a renewal notice once a year. That's about it.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : So, and I think that's in January each year. So that's not even due for now six months. But I might leave what I've got for now and see if I can contact them and just see what the what the conditions are and see they're comparable to yours.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[7 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Because like you say, it's not just the money you said, it's the extra benefits that you get like some others may not have.
[8 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And, umm, you know, of course I understand if you need to look into your current policy. Umm, that definitely makes sense. Umm, I would just ask if you wanted to go through the health and lifestyle questions just to see if you are eligible for it. And then alternatively, I can send you information for you to have a look at yourself. Would you like to do that?
[8 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I could do that.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And just before I do go into that as well, we will send you a free will kit, OK, so that would also you you know just give you instructions in like the basis of your will and how to put that together. OK. And just another thing to note as well that your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year, OK? So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $107.94.
[8 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK. So you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. But yeah, let me go through those questions with you just to see if you're eligible. Umm, before I do, I would just need to put a postcard in for yourself. 4017 And what's that area, please?
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : 4017 Bracken Ridge, Bracken.
[9 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Brighton Ridge and your address, Yep. Breckenridge and your first address line? Yep. Whitby St. Yep.
