So for the funeral insurance, it is designed to provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to your loved ones when you pass away.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Now, they can use the funds not only for funeral expenses, but also any other final expenses like unpaid bills. For example, you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive a nominated amount.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : And if your death is due to an accident, then your chosen benefit of that is going to triple so that your family has some additional support. So who did you have his beneficiaries previously?

[3 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : None.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : If you're in Australian resident age between 40 and 79, acceptance is guaranteed. So what I will do is bring that up. So for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause. In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with the terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we will pay your claim in full to help with things like medical expenses. Now you can choose between 3000 up to 15,000. A couple of things to note as well, how are your premiums are level, which means they are designed to stay the same as you get older and when you reach the age of 85, your premiums will cease. So you'll have nothing more to pay, but you will continue to be covered and you also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover applied to your benefit amount. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website and your cover also provides you with an early cash out options. So anytime after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover and we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit.

[14 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : I'll have a look there with you. Let's have a look and I'll get you sent out the I love that name, Hazel. Actually, I think it's a nice name.
[15 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Hazel Jane Jones.
[15 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Nice. All right, let's have a quick look at the life insurance and I can get that sent out there for you to review.
[15 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[15 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So without life insurance, we actually it doesn't include TPD so it includes a lump sum payment and you can choose cover between 10,000 up to 200,000. It covers death and terminal illness. Is that something you were wanting to look at or was it just TPD You were looking at?
[15 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : So PD, what was it?
[15 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Uh payday. What was it? TTPD, which is total and permanent disability. Sorry, we actually don't offer that.
[15 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : PD Yeah.
[15 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : I was mistaken. Yeah.
[15 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Oh, you don't?
[15 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : No, sorry. So we do have life insurance. If you're interested in the information for that. I can still get it sent out there for you, but it doesn't include what you had originally asked, which is the disability if you can't work.
[16 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. No, that's fine, mate. Yeah. Could you send me the other paperwork? So I was going to read through that as well and check on that.
[16 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So you're happy with just the funeral insurance for the life insurance? Yeah. Yeah. All right, let me bring it up then and I'll explain for you. So with the seniors life insurance, it is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones to a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. So this one's to help, you know, pay off perhaps umm, a bit of a mortgage or leave a bit of investment money for your family, umm, or some money, say for your partner to continue to financially support herself for a little while, whatever it might be. Now you can choose cover between 10,000 up to 200,000. Umm, if your death is due to an accident, that chosen benefit amount will triple. We also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help towards funeral costs.
[16 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[17 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So they have an additional umm, 20% there that they can use on top of the funeral insurance.
[17 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : That much for that. Oh, OK, yeah.
[17 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Uh, so 20% of the benefit amount, yes, it depends on what level of cover we look at. So it's also very easy to apply. We just ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you are approved. And if you're approved and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 15 months. Umm, in addition, they use a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a specialized medical, wait, sorry. If you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to leave by specialized medical practitioner, we will pay your claim in full to help with things like, you know, the medical costs to ensure you receive the best care possible. So the funeral insurance that covers, umm, a terminal illness if you're diagnosed with 12 months or less to live, this one would kick in at 24 months. So this would be paid to be able to be paid prior, so not an extra 12 months prior.
[17 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[18 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : And umm, what else is this? Including a subscription to Australian Seniors Day magazine as well? All right, let's have a look now. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Sorry, a cigarette.
[18 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : And a what dot?
[18 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : What benefit amount would you like for me to quote you on? Between 10,000 up to 200,000.
[19 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Probably about 100,000.
[19 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, let's see. So $100,000 cover comes to a fortnightly premium of $119, which equates to only $8.50 per day for $100,000 cover. Would that be within affordability for you?
[19 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : No, I did think about that one.
[19 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'm going to send it out for you to think about anyway.
[19 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[19 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : But would that fit in affordability for you?
[19 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, there's something what I'm looking at.
[19 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. All right. So as long as you do you want any other quotes or just that one?
[19 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, just that one. Thanks.
[19 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : All right. And your premium is steps, which means it will increase each year. As an indication if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $127.33 per fortnight. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. Now I'm what I'm going to do is I'm going to send you an e-mail which will include the indicative quotes we have discussed today and links to the product disclosure statement and our financial services guide.
