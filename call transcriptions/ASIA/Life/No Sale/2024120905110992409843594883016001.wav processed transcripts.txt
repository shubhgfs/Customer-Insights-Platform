So here at Australian Seniors Life Insurance, what we do is we provide financial protection for your for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday in which is when the policy ends. Now you can choose cover between $10,000 up to $200,000 and you nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the nominated benefit amount. So do you have any idea who you'd like to umm, nominate as your beneficiary?
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : My daughter.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Oh, perfect. So yes, if death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit amount will triple. And we also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit. And now just to help with through no cost and all ex final expenses at the time. So the for an example, the accident was due to this and you had $100,000 worth of cover that will triple and be $300,000. And then we also provide an advance payment of 20% on top of that.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : MMM MMM MMM.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Now it is easy to apply for Ramani. All we do is we just ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone. And if you are approved then what happens is you are covered immediately for death due to any cause except for suicide in the 1st 13 months once you accept them and once you commence the policy. In addition, there is also a terminally ill advanced payment which is included in the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to leave by the specialized medical practitioner, what we do is we pay your benefit amount in full to help you with the medical costs, just to ensure that you have received the best care possible while you're still alive. Yeah. So do you have any questions for me so far?
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : No, not now. I need a port and I will confirm you later. OK?
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. So let's go through a quote together Now to begin with reminding, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I don't smoke. I'm a nonsmoker.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's good. That's very good. Because that does keep your premium to a lower amount than opposed to a smoker.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So did you say that you were looking at $100,000? Correct.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Mm.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK. Were you looking to pay this 4 nightly or monthly?
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Hmm, I think better fortnightly.
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. So remind me, for $100,000 of coverage, you're looking at a payment of $82.35 per fortnight.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, how is that sounding in terms? Yep. After you turn 85, that's when the policy ends.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : OK, so how how long I have to pay this one till I get 80 turn 80 I turn 85. When did the policy end?
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : That's correct.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : OK, so if I think turn 85 I can get the my all money back or?
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So, Yep, Yeah. So if you turn 85, what we do is sorry. Let me just provide you with the correct information so that I'm not sorry. Bear with me. Sorry. Is it OK if I just place you on a brief hold for two or three minutes just so I can find out the information for you?
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : No worries. Thank you.

[7 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : So what do? When did I get the money then when I passed away, only I will get the money.
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : So this is only if you were to pass away before your 18th birthday when the policy ends? Yeah. Or in addition, if there is a terminally ill advanced payment that's included in the cover. If you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to leave by a specialized medical practitioner or if you were to pass away, those are the only times that yet you would receive the funds.
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK, so if if I don't pass away before before that I won't get anything OK, if I don't pass away before 85 then I won't get any fund but I paid I will get it back.
