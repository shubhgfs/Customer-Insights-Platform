I'll just make sure we have the right details that have come through from online umm and let you know our calls are recorded. Any advice that I do provide, it is general in nature. It may not be suitable to your situation.

[54 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[56 seconds][Agent] : Very good. Now, uh, what I'll do is explain the main features and benefits and then we can have a look at some pricing to get that. But just I can gain a better understanding of where they're starting and what's sparked your interest. Are you new to life insurance or do you currently have some cover?
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I had cover, but it just got too expensive mate. So. So no, no.
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK, so you're no longer covered with that one now that's OK, let's have a look for you. So with the seniors life insurance, it is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones for a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. So it's there to cover you during that sensitive time period. Umm, it perhaps if there's a bit of mortgage or some loans that we just want to leave some financial support.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : If you were to pass away sooner rather than later, which you can choose cover between 10,000 up to 200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount.
[1 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Now, if that is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple. Given the unexpected circumstance. We also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. Now it's very easy to apply. We just ask you a yes or no questions relating to your help over the phone to see if you're approved.

Uh, if accepted, once you commence the policy you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. And we also include cover for any pre-existing conditions.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep. In the cover.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Is there TRA trauma in there or is it is that the separate setup?
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so travel insurance isn't something that we include in our cover. Umm, so we just have the life insurance. We do have a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can pay the benefit amount in full to help with medical costs to ensure you receive the best care possible.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. Yep. Yep.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Umm, Now with this one here, we'll go through some pricing to have a look together. Let me bring that off. I can see you put down there for a joint cover. So you're also looking for, umm, a wife or partner?

But if anything was to be linked back to smoking then it would be fully covered for you. OK, Now between 10,000 up to 200,000, we can look at as many different amounts to find what's going to be affordable for you. But where would you like to start?
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm, mm, hmm. Oh, look, just look at the 200 for now.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's have a look. So for 200,000, that would be $261.28 per fortnight. How does that sound?
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : So that's 4400 a month, but well, I'll say 405.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, closer to 500 over just over 500 per month. So that be within affordability for you or should we do some adjusting?
