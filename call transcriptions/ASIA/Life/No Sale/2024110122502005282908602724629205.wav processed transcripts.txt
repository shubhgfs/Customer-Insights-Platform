[2 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Alright, if you could go through the quote, that'd be awesome.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure, sure. Umm. So seniors life insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you pass, if you were to pass away, sorry, before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. So you can choose cover between $10,000 up to $200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, so if death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple and we also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount at claims time to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses. OK, now it's easy to reply, we just ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you're approved. OK then if you are accepted and once you commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any 'cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK. In addition, there's also a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can pay your benefit amount in full to help with medical costs to make sure you receive the best care possible. Umm, so just in terms of obviously umm, the quotes come through for your husband Joseph. Umm, I'm not just, so it is umm, subject to approval. Sorry, I, I, I know we're, we're sort of just going through quotes here. Umm, but it, it being subject to approval, it obviously we need to take you through, umm, health and lifestyle questions.
