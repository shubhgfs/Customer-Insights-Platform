[2 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So our seeing is life insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones to a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday and the policy ends. You can choose cover between $10,000 up to $200,000 and normally up to five beneficiaries receive minimum benefit amount. If that is due to an accident, your term benefits will triple and we also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with fuel costs or any other final expenses at the time.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : It's easy to apply, we just ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you're approved. If you accepted and once you commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for that due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. In addition, that is a terminally ill advanced payment including the cover. If you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by specialized medical practitioner, you can pay a benefit amount in full to help them at the cost to ensure you receive the best care possible. So darling, do you have any questions for me so far?
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't.
