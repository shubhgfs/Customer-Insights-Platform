[1 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[1 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic. And just to understand your circumstances a little bit better, as we do have people inquiring into life insurance for different reasons. What what is inquiring? What's important for you to protect?
[1 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Oh, just looking a bit of the future.
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Sure. And umm, when you're looking into the future, what are you, what are you looking to protect?
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : No. Yeah.
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : If you got, for example, a mortgage that you're looking to cover off or you're just leaving a, a lump sum time behind to some loved ones or OK, sure, sure. Got you.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Kids partner. Yeah.
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : And is this when we say loved ones, is this for some children, a partner, all the above? Sure. OK, not a problem. Let me take you through, uh, a quote to ex uh, look at some pricing together. I'll explain while I'll, I'm loading that up how our cover works so that you've got an understanding of what umm, that cost represents and we can look, look to find something that fits into your circumstances. OK.
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Okey dokey.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK. So and with our life insurance, it is designed to do exactly what you described, which is to look to the future and provide a bit of financial security to your loved ones if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday, which is when the policy ends. Now you can choose your own benefit amount anywhere between the ranges of $10,000 and $200,000, and you're also able to nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their own nominated benefit amount. OK, now in with this policy.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : If your death was due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple and inclu. Included in the cover is an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to assist with any final expenses such as funeral costs or outstanding bills, any legal fees, TRA, transportation costs, it doesn't matter. It's there to assist your loved ones with those immediate expenses at your time of passing. Sorry, Ian, I didn't catch that.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : That's exactly the sort of thing we're looking for.
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Oh, perfect. So that's generally paid within one business day and receipt of claims forms and supporting documents without advanced payment. Now in terms of the application process, and it's really simple and straightforward. It's easy to apply. We just ask a yes or no questions in relation to your health, so we'll go through those quickly today to confirm your eligibility. If you are eligible and you decide to commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause except for suicide in the 1st 13 months. And then in addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included. So if you're diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialised medical practitioner, we can pay that full claim directly to you in in in order to assist you with any medical expenses you have and ensure you get the best care possible. OK. So that's an explanation of how the cover works in terms of the benefits and features. Any questions from you so far, Ian?
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Not at this stage, you know?
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, all fairly straightforward for you.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And Ian, to provide you with some pricing, I need to firstly ask you, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : No.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic. And in terms of the range of cover you want me to look at reminding you, you can choose between $10,000 and $200,000. I can go through any number of options for you today. But where would you like me to commence?
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Oh, we filled 100,000 is probably enough to to do what we might like for the family and suites.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure, sure, sure. And just on on that note and please bear in mind with this cover is a flexible policy. So if you did want to start say for example at $100,000 and you decide in the future you want to increase the benefit amount you have, you're always welcome to apply for an additional pop up policy subject to your eligibility at the time up to the Max amount of $200,000. If you'd like to reduce at any stage, you can give us a call and apply to reduce. In fact, you can cancel at any time, OK?
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK, that's it.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So in terms of the $100,000 per fortnight, that would be $306.84. So in terms of how that might fit into your circumstances and you'll have to guide me, is that affordable for you or do we need to look at some other options for you?
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No, I think that's affordable.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : I don't think it's number ******* you know, a round Number like 300. It's not too hard to work out.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Sure, not a problem. Umm and just to close out the the umm information puzzle here in this is a steps premium, which means it will increase each year and I'll give you an indication. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year would be $328.32 fortnight. OK. And you can't find further information about a premium structure on the website, just to let you know, but if that is sounding like it might be suitable, what I'll do in that case, Ian, is confirm your eligibility, send out documents for you to review and we'll, uh, walk you through getting covered. So, uh, in terms of sending it, uh, uh, sorry, in terms of sending documents to you, is your postal address the same as your home address?
