OK, what I'm going to do is I will need to add an interpreter. Can you confirm what language you speak?
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : No, uh, just before you add in, uh, interpreter, we've been through this, uh, questions, uh, uh, actually to, uh, first or second question. Last time we interrupted, uh, and because we were not sure, uh, regarding to some, uh, uh, uh, like, uh, issues, uh, like, uh, the questions you had, we did, we were not clear about the answers. That's why we went to, uh, her GP to get a whole record of five years, uh, to see it, to make it, uh, clear and answer the old questions correctly.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. If I've got the, all the five years record in front of me, like there's, uh, a few pages, like 100 or 50 pages, something like that.

Uh, uh, that's, uh, that's all good, but I have to help her regarding to the answer, But it's still, I'm not the, uh, umm, uh, I, I don't, I'm not able to answer the correct way. That's why I, I thought if I e-mail you the record, is that, or, or you, uh, ask her GP regarding some questions which we are not sure does it work that way or, or because we, we don't wanna answer wrong and that's when she needs the most. Uh, then say no, you did, uh, you didn't answer this correctly.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : So, uh, I don't wanna go that way at all. I wanna, uh, be straightforward correct now and not to be, uh, excuse for anyone, me or someone else in the future.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : No, sure, no sure, definitely. What I'm going to do is I'm going to just have to place you on a brief hold for maybe 5 or 6 minutes. I will need to get some clarification on whether we can receive an e-mail from you with her health documentation. I do sorry, remember this call, I did have a Persian interpreter in the last calls that we had on the 9th of December. And then we did get up to the heart questions. But then we did advise you to provide us with more information once you've received all that from your doctor.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So I'm also just going to place you on a brief hold on Mohammed, just so I can see some more clarification into this to see what we can do because I do understand how important it is to answer the questions correctly. Just so that therefore I, if you were to make a claim in the future, you would be able to, umm, proceed with this in the right manner.
