So seniors life insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday. When the policy ends, you can choose cover between $10,000 and up to $200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the nominated benefit amount.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Right, OK, right, sure. Right.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so if that is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple. And we also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help the funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : OK, right. Yeah, Well, that's another Ave. I was looking at. I was going to, I, I was thinking about funeral funds and that sort of thing. And I, I was going to, uh, with our local funeral director, uh, organize a, a prepaid insu, you know, like a burial thing or not burial, but, and, uh, because when my wife passed away, we didn't have anything there.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Oh, lovely, yeah.

[3 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's not a problem.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.

[4 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : I know it sounds sounds pretty right.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, well, let's have a look at a quote together. Umm, may I ask, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No, definitely not.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. OK, And keeping in mind umm, our level of cover ranges from $10,000 up to $200,000. Umm, we can look at different amounts, umm, to suit your needs as well. What amount would you like me to begin with?
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep, look, just do the 200,000 and and we'll go and then work down from there if I need to.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, by all means, that's not a problem. OK. So Martin, for $200,000 of cover, you're looking at a premium of $500.95 per fortnight.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. How does that sound? Or do you want to have a look at some other levels of cover?
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Fortnight every two weeks.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's every two weeks.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : So that's 1000 and $11180.00 a month.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : I can change that to monthly for you?
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's what it would be, wouldn't it? Yeah.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yes, it's $1085.39 a month. I can drop that.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, but just leave it at that at the moment anyway. And if I wanna change it, I can. Can I?
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, you can reduce the cover.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : The only thing is you can't increase it. So 200 the most anyway that we have.
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Alright, so I gather if you went say, 100,000 it would be half that amount, Yeah?
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So if I go to $100,000 of cover, umm, did you want the monthly or the fortnightly premium?

[6 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, so for $100,000 of cover, umm, it's $542.69 per month.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : It's not.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Well, that's totally up to you.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : We're actually better off staying on the other, aren't you?
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I will let you know. Your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Right, Right. Yep.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : As an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year on the $100,000 would be $580.68 per month.
