[4 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[2 seconds][Agent] : I'm just giving you an idea. Hey, good morning, Claudia, it's Sarah. I'm calling from Australian Seniors. I'm calling to help you about with the life insurance. Sir, Thank you for putting being quiet through just now. We'll go through some pricings together and do feel free to ask questions along the way. OK, Thank you so much. Please remember all calls are recorded and any advice I provide you, Claudia, is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. Your name is Claudio Puccini.
[20 seconds][Customer] : OK, that's fine.
[33 seconds][Agent] : Very good. And your date of birth, 5th of October 59, very close to mine. I'm on the 15th.
[37 seconds][Customer] : Yep, 01/1.
[41 seconds][Agent] : And uh yeah. And Claudia, can I also check with you? You are a male and an Australian resident, is that right? Awesome. And let's quickly check your smoking status as well whilst we're at it. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[48 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, I gave up two months ago.
[56 seconds][Agent] : Claudia, well done. Year resolution.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Well, early, early in the year.
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Is it sort of early one? OK, very good. So thank you so much for that. So life insurance, let's have a quick, let's have a quick turn on that. So life insurance, this one we've actually designed for seniors and pensioners, Claudio, it's designed to provide you with a bit of financial security for yourself, for yourself or for your family actually at the same age. So it's designed to provide financial protection for your family to a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends, Claudio. And you can actually choose from $10,000 up to $200,000 as well. And you can choose up to five people to receive this money. Now, Claudia, I just want to know a little bit about you. What's the reason for you to do this? Is there like a mortgage in place or is it just for your dependents?
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK, well help with the mortgage.
[1 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK. And there is. So there is a bit of, uh, outstanding on that still. OK, So what are you're trying to do is just give yourself the piece of mind knowing that if something happens to you unexpectedly, your family can use this money to pay off the mortgage and secure the home. Is that it?
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, we we'll make payments until they sell the home.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. And they can have that. OK, got it. So like I said, uh, life insurance does exactly that. So ours is actually a very simple one to apply for as well. Uh, I'm going to ask you some very simple questions around your health, Claudio, because we need to check if you're eligible for it. Not everyone gets accepted. So no need for medicals, no need for blood reports test, nothing. All you need to do is with me answer 8 or 8 yes or no questions relating to your health. If you are accepted Claudio. And once you start the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any calls except suicide in the 1st 13 months. And please tell your family as well that if your death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit amount triples.
[3 minutes][Customer] : OK, OK.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : And please also let them know that they will have the option to request 20% of the benefit amount in advance during claims time to take care of immediate funeral costs. We do understand claims can be, uh, quite a difficult time for families to go through. So we have a team here, uh, who specializes in that area and they work with the families at that time to keep the process simple and straightforward.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, all good so far, very good. Now, your life insurance will also come with a terminally ill advanced payment for you, which means that if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, you can call us yourself, Claudia, and you can apply for the claims yourself at that time in full beautiful. Is that your partner there with you?
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK, she's not with me right now, but she's only 49.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, so she wants to be covered as well. Is that what you meant? You have noticed you put a joint request, so you and your partner, right?
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, her premiums will look different than yours. Then we look at a few different, uh, we look at a few factors and, uh, because she's a female and if she's younger, even if she chooses the same amount, it may look very different from yours. OK, I'll talk to her later on. Whether you do it this together or separately works out to be exactly the same. So I'll talk to her later.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. OK.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Now my question to is, Claudio, if something was to happen with you, how much do you think your wife would need to make those mortgage payments and secure the home and sell it later?
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Well, I don't know what the difference in cost would be between the 100 and the 200.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's what I'm calling for. You and I will go through that though. OK, So you want to see the difference between 200,000 and 100,000?
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : You see, let's have a look right now. The $200,000 cover, it's showing a monthly payment. So I'm looking at fortnightly payments.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, every two weeks, $200,000 cover, which is our maximum, will be $342.48 every fortnight.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Half of that $100,000 cover will be $171.24 per fortnight. Now, between the two, mm hmm, take a moment, do the math and tell me which one will be more suitable.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, probably the 200.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. And with this policy as well, remember this is a life insurance. Your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year. And I'm going to show you very quickly how that happens. It's absolutely clear and transparent. So as an indication, Claudia, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $366.45 per fortnight. Claudia, you can also find information about a premium structure on our website as well. OK, now let's find out, Claudia, if you're eligible for this.

[14 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : And the very last one, are you experiencing any unexplained symptoms or are you currently undergoing or waiting for the results of any health related tests or investigations or been diagnosed as having 12 months or less to live? Like I said, Claudia, it seems like your wife, yourself, you take very good care of yourself. So the advisers have approved you. Well done, Claudia. I go through a lot of applications every day. It's great to see at your age. Your application has been approved. So well done. Whatever you're doing, it's working. OK, You're welcome. So what? I'll be more than you know, get the policy documents all organized to be sent. So I'll arrange to get a, uh, a set of your policy information sent to your e-mail in the next 15 to 20 minutes, Claudio. And I'll also arrange to get a, another copy sent to your address as well. So you'll get an e-mail copy today and then you'll also get a copy to sent your address in the next two to five working days. What I want you to do, Claudio, is when you receive these documents, take your time again to read through it with your wife. Go through it, make sure everything looks alright and do let us know who your beneficiaries are.
[14 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No, OK.
[15 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, you can choose is up to five. Now I know you're doing this for your family Claudio, but say after reading the document, say for whatever reason in the next few days something changes and you can't keep the policy anymore. That is absolutely fine. Our policy comes with a full 30 day cooling off. And we will provide a full refund of your payments unless the claim has been made in that time. OK, and you don't even have make a payment today, Claudia, you can actually choose your payment date. So here at Australia and Seniors, we let our customers pick their own payment date. So that way you can align it with a say a payday or a day that's more convenient. OK, you're covered from today anyway. Now today is umm, just look at my calendar. It's on 9th and it's Thursday. When do you want the first payment coming out, Claudia? Just pick a day.
[15 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK, well if we do it, it'll be next Thursday, but all of this. So I'm going to sit with my wife and see her quite her amount as well and then and then take it. I'm not just going to take it by myself.

[16 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[16 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Has she had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[17 minutes][Customer] : No.
[17 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So her premiums will look different than yours. As I said, even if you choose the same amount now and Ernie feels the same way as as you yourself, Claudia, it's a financial support for each other to secure the home and pay of the mortgage. OK, so her range, the benefits and features will be the same for her as well. And her range is the same as well, $10,000 up to $200,000. How much do you want to look at for her?
[17 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yes, the same 200.
[17 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Two 100,000. OK, ready for this Claudio?
[17 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep.

[17 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I knew that.
[17 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So that's her positive, uh, when I speak with her, she will just need to confirm whether she's happy with that or not. Umm, So what I need, like I said, whether you do this together or separately, the benefits and features, it all works out to be the same anyway. So when she's home, I'll give her a call. So where she she at work? OK, I'll talk to her la let me just grab her number so I can call her later. And if you want to put her number on your account as well as a secondary number, I could do that as well. What's her number? Yeah, I'm so sorry you got cut out. So 042178? Yeah, 622. Do you want to keep her number on your account as well as the secondary 1?
[18 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 0421780, 780622 yes.
[18 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : I see. So now it will be. I'm just giving you the total because you said you want to see what her payments look like. So hers will be $68.34 per fortnight. So together you'd be looking at $410.82 per fortnight and that'll be $200,000 cover each. Does that work for both of you?
[18 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : It sounds like it. When she when she comes home, I'll go over it. I'll have that e-mail by then, right?
[18 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so, uh, just to let you know, for you, just to let you know what your options are, I can definitely send you an e-mail with the price and the PDS for you both to read first. That's absolutely something you can do. Or the other option available as well is because your application has been approved. I, we can actually cover you from that, get all the actual policy done and sent for yours customers for you. So that way you're protected just in case something happens that changes, you get to sit and read it with Ernie. If everything looks alright for you, the policy stays and use different detected and for it to get started. Now you don't even have to make a payment now, you can just choose a future payment date and we'll get it started. Are you happy to do that now?
[19 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine.
[19 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, anything. Please take your time, ask me whatever you would need to go ahead.
[19 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Just a second once, can I have the first payment on the 16th?
[19 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Of course. And can you tell me as well? Uh, yeah, I'll put her for 16th. And Claudia, uh, what time will Ernie be home today or when did you finish work so I can call her? OK. And when does she start work? Tomorrow.
[20 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : She won't be home till 6:00, 7:00 in the morning.
[20 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Wow, what did she do?
