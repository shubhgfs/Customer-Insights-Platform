[5 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Right. OK.

[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So it's just nine yes or no questions relating to a health you ask over the phone so you don't have to go to the doctors get any blood tests or medical tests done at all.

[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no problem.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Now, once you commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[6 minutes][Customer] : Oh, wow.
[6 minutes][Agent] : And in addition to that, that is a benefit we hope you don't have to use.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : And that's the terminally ill advanced payment.
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, then we can pay your benefit in a in full to help with medical costs to ensure you receive the best care possible.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Now, a little pretty straightforward. Any questions about the covers so far, Mary?
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : No, it's pretty good. Yeah, it's fine.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, 1-2.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So also at the premium for $200,000 of cover, it is coming out to a fortnightly premium of $143.85 per fortnight.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Is that something that's sounding?
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : That's fine.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Is that something that's sounding affordable?
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : It is.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah.
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Well, you don't drink or smoke and even though I, I don't even, you know, like do want to sneak and go and get that mica's coughing, I'm even not even enjoying that. I'm not even enjoying it. Do you know what I mean? So I've stopped for the past 12 weeks. I haven't even been sneaking out, you know, on the way to work grabbing a mica's coffee. I'm not enjoying it.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. OK.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : So I would get the money I've got in the jar that I've I, I still put the money in the jar to prove that that's how much I'm saving.
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that's great. That's good to hear.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, you know, so that can go in my, my insurance.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So exactly with our insurance, it does only work out for that premium to roughly $10.28 per day.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Oh, the like, if I like, you know, like I'm in the office from four in the one until 2:00 in the afternoon, then the hours will change because I'm within the international company.
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So it does go a long way helping pay that, Yeah.
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : And then that would change. The thing is, you know, anything can happen to you, you know, like you have a stroke or anything. You just don't know. I mean, I'm pretty fit, right? I'm lucky I'm pretty fit. I've got the gym, you know what I mean? But still, it doesn't matter. Even even being super fit, you can still have a heart attack.
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yep, yeah, definitely. So no one does know when they're gonna go.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : I don't know. So I'm bringing, Well, my mummy went at 8-1, my dad went at 8, four and a half. So I'm thinking, oh, I'm hoping I can get to at least 90. I'm hoping, but I'd like a good steady your innings, which just you ******* do up.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, Yeah. Well.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : But at the moment it's like I'm facing my own work allergy because of my mother. Thanks very much. So that's where I'm at.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, yeah, that's how it goes, isn't it?
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : It is, yeah. So you carry on. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
[8 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So, yeah, no, that's all good. It's been good talking to you, Mary.
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : I try and make the joke about, you know what I'm saying because I think it's not old, you know what I mean?
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, definitely not. I know when when my time comes, I want everyone to have a a party for me.
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No, Well this is that, I mean that, you know, why not? I mean, we're going to enjoy it. You know, they've got to celebrate something, haven't they?
[9 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, exactly. Like the most of the. Yep.
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : But I just said I've got 3, three children, 2 girls and a boy, and I've got 2 grandchildren, but I've also got a niece and nephew. So I'm not sure how I'm gonna be able to, to buy all that.
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : You know what I mean? So I need a bit of help with that because.
[9 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. So like I said before, you can put up to five and it just it's going to get paid out today in the bank account there.
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And of course, they can distribute that from there and make sure it goes to however needs it and for any expenses that may arise.
[9 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK, that's fine.
[9 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Now keep in mind Barry as well that your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year.
[10 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Hold on.
[10 minutes][Agent] : So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $153.92 per fortnight. Yes, yeah, roughly $75 per week there.
[10 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Less than $75 a week and it's honestly, when you add up for an example, 535 a day, what's that 510152025, the 3035? See, you're paying, you're probably you're paying nearly $40 a week in coffees if, if you indulge, right. So that's the way I look at it.
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK. Yeah.
[10 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So you can see uses money that you're saving some coffee isn't put it towards that.
[10 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : You know what I mean? So I look at that. So just saving $40 a week, right. All you've got to put it together is 35. That's it. That's just 75 a week.
[10 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So, yeah, yeah, yeah, that, that'll do it. So, yeah, whatever you need to do to to get that money.
[11 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[11 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So lots of different ways to save there.
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : That's right. But I'm thinking how much is it upfront? How much is it to pay the whole lot for the year? How much is it annually?
[11 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So for an annual payment, I can definitely have a look at that, how much it's gonna work out. Now, while I bring that up, keep in mind that if you need more information about our premium structure, Mary, you can always find it on our website.
[11 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. That should be fine. That's fine. But I'm just thinking, well, like I've got to pay it like the car and everything else this weekend, get out of the way.
[11 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep. OK.
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : But I'm thinking maybe next week I could maybe just go bang, you know, put put a yeah, you can't.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So for the year's annual payment, Mary, it's coming up to an annual premium of $3740.12 per year.
[11 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : All right, so go to work for months. So for work for months, I can pay that off in one go. I could, you know what I mean before the end of the financial year.
[12 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So we've covered as well Mary.
[12 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : So let me think about that kind of thing.
[12 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So you can, you can choose a payment date that is going to work best for you.
[12 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So you can choose one that lines up with a payday, whatever it is going to work best for the first payment to start from.
[12 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : OK. So can we start from next week, next Thursday, You take the payment out next Thursday? Yeah, that's fine.
[12 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Next Thursday, yeah, we're going to say so first thing before that is we'll have to make sure you are going to be approved for the cover and also with that payment for you, are you looking to continue with the fortnightly or annual or what was going to work best?
[12 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think I'll do that. Let me start off fortnightly and then when I've got the 3000, I'm I'll ring you, Sir. And I'll then say can I make that annual payment?
[12 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah. So I just.
[12 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm sorry thing because, because what I had meant from from me paying that three brands or whatever it is from that point, then I can be putting money away for the annual payment. Then someone send.
[13 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yes. OK. So yeah, exactly. I see what you're saying there. So just save that money until you have enough to afford that annual amount.
[13 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then, then I'll be able to stay, right? I'm going to do an annual payment. So we're going to, we're going to an annual payment. All right.
[13 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Wonder.
[13 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : And by the time the next annual payment comes through, I'll have the money.
[13 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful. OK. I'm just having a look here. Now keep in mind as well that even though there are those different payment options, it does work out the same at the end of the year whether you pay fortnightly, monthly or annually.
[13 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's fine. But I'm thinking it's better off getting out the way.
[13 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK.
[13 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : You know what I mean? Something just instead of getting it out the way.
[13 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Now just having no, yeah, OK.
[14 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[14 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, if that's your preference, then I definitely can go ahead with that there. Now I'll just check with that payment frequency now, making sure it is something that you are going to be able to change in the middle of your policy there.
[14 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. Yes. Because it might have to be writing your policy. Yeah.
[14 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : No, yes, that may be something that you can only change on the anniversary.
[14 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[14 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So what I'm going to do, Mary, is just put you on a brief hold and just confirm the answer to that question.
[14 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yes. True.
[14 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : See if he can change it during the policy or if it has to be as an anniversary.
