[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Alrighty, now I'll explain how the cover works. So it's very straightforward. So it's easier. What we do is we pay the money out of the lump sum payment, OK?
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Uh, in the event that you would have passed, so you choose who the beneficiary that you choose who the money goes to in, in other words, who the beneficiaries are, OK.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : And we pay the money out as a lump sum payment and then they can use that money however they see fit.
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. OK Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Uh, so with this cover, we pay this money out as a lump sum payment if you were to pass away, uh, before your 85th birthday when the policy ends, OK, Now in saying that, if you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately to death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : If you take it out today and tomorrow you pass it in a car accident or a heart attack, for example, Touchwood, it'll be caught for those kind of things, OK?
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Now there's also a terminally ill advanced payment included, which means that at any time you hold the policy, if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by specialized medical practitioner, then obviously in that case, you pay out 100% of the life insurance benefit amount to you while you allow.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, uh, now just one more thing in regards to your premium. You might know this already, but your premium is stepped, which is it will increase each year. I'll give you an example as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $59.50, a $4.00.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : It's gonna be roughly $4.00 if you were to take it out of the $50,000 cover.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Uh, but you can also find information about our premium instruction, our website as well. OK, uh, now gonna be desired. It's a pre underwriting disclosure statement. It's to explain to you bit about the questions and how you should go about to answer them. And then we'll go straight into the case so it's easier.
