[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And so let's have a look. So with that as well. So if you are fully approved for cover without any changes, it is immediate cover for death by any cause except for suicide in the 1st 13 months, OK. And then also included is a terminally ill advanced payment. Hopefully. Of course, you'll never use this, but it's there for the worst, OK? It means that if you were diagnosed by a medical practitioner as having 24 months or less to live, we do pay out your life insurance in full to you. OK.
[2 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK, thank you.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So like, hopefully, of course, you never use it for that reason, but we include that benefit for the worst case. No. Alright, so let's go to that pricing. Did you have any questions at all?

[4 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : And similarly, you know, if you start off at 200 or 300 and that's too much, you just give us a call and you can get your cover decreased at any time as well, alright?
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Excellent. Thank you.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Like I said, yeah, it is pretty flexible in that sense.

[4 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : At the end of the day, it's your policy, alright?
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So look, if we go $100,000, all right, So best option I've got for you is with real life insurance and you'd be paying $65.15 per fortnight, so just under $33 a week.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : And how is that monthly?
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Oh, do you prefer to make a monthly payment?
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : That's yes.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep. And I'll just went out. So regardless of whether you pay fortnightly monthly or annual basis, you're not penalized.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : It's all calculated by the same daily rate, OK, So for going monthly for the 100,000 it's $141.16.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep. Got that.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Alright, 200,000 it would double.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So it'll be two 8233 per month and then 300,000 would be 4/23/50 per month.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : I'm trying to remember how much I used to pay. Umm, I think it's a bit more actually. Umm, I reckon I've got a 200.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yep. All right. So we'll start there. And so we'll go through the questions, OK, to make sure we can get you approved and it will determine the final cost and pricing as well. OK.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, sure.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Now part of that policy that I haven't mentioned, there's an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount up to a maximum of $20,000 to help cover funeral costs. That's made out quite quickly within usually one business day of completed documents being received.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : All right, what you also get with that policy from real insurance, sorry, next year following your first policy anniversary date, you're going to get a 10% refund on the premiums you've paid during that time. So that's a little way of saying thank you.

[8 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : In addition, the policy has automatic indexation, which means that each year the benefit amount will increase by 5% with unassociated increase in premium until you reach the maximum benefit amount or until the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday. If you don't want that, you can simply choose each year to opt out of the automatic indexation and keep the benefit amount same. Alright, but what it does mean, So next year, as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, the monthly payment would be $329.90 with your benefit amount going up to $210,000.
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Right. Yep.
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, Like I said, if you're happy to keep it the same benefit amount, when we send you that policy renewal, you just give us a call.

[30 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Would you like me to call them now, see if I can, if the subscription has been look at it. Yep.
[30 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Alright, well, just give, just give me a moment because I do. There's a couple of things with regards to this application. There's a couple of things I want to go through at the moment where they stand.
[30 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Sure, sure. Yep.
[30 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Alright, So what I wanted to bring up. So there has been a cup, there's been some changes to the pricing. It has gone up on this one for two reasons. It's and first of all, it's due to the mental health. So the stress episode requiring treatment within the last six months. OK.
[30 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : I did start. Sorry I I had missed a few words. Robert.
[30 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : And it's also oh, sorry, no, that's that's it. Sorry.
[30 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Alright. Yep.
[30 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : There's two reasons why the price has gone up with regards to this policy, OK, First reason is for the mental health section with regards to your stress, OK, with the one to two episodes and the symptoms or treatment within the last six months.
[31 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Alright, right. Yep.
[31 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : And then the second reason the price has gone up is due to BMI, OK, So your height to weight ratio, alright.
[31 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Good man.
[31 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So if we do stick with the real insurance policy, OK, The new monthly price on that, it has gone up to $765.40 for the 200,000, yeah, alright.
[31 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Oh oh boy. Yeah.
[31 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So, but so this and This is why I wanted to go through this.
[31 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[31 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : What we can consider, OK, is we do have the Australian seniors policy which is coming in cheaper than that for you, OK?
[32 minutes][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[32 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : And so the price on the seniors policy, it won't change with regards to answering the questions. It is one set price, OK, And there's not as many questions to ask about either, alright.
[32 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[32 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So with the seniors policy, it does work a little bit differently, alright. So with that cover, the policy covers you until your 85th birthday, at which point the policy will end. If your death is by accident, the payout will get triples. OK. And then with regards to the terminally ill advance payment, it is still there. It means if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, the life insurance will be paid out in full to you. OK.
[32 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, Autoset.
[32 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So a $200,000 cover the monthly payment for that policy, it would be $437.14 or if you wanted to consider it, we can go back to $100,000, which would be $218.57 a month.
[33 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Well, why don't we start there? Yeah. And then once I sort of giggle down a bit, I could see what changes I can make.
[33 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, later.
[33 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK. And so with this one, OK, So there's only 8 questions that you need to answer for me and they're very specific in their wording. OK.
[33 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[33 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So I've already read to you the pre underwriting disclosure. You still understand and agree to that.
[33 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[33 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Thank you. You've answered for me the COVID question. We don't need to go through that. Sorry.
