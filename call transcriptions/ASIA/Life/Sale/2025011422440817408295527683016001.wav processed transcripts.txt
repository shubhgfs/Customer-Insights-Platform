[2 seconds][Customer] : Hello, Michael.
[4 seconds][Agent] : Hi Rachel, My name's Joel. I'm calling from the Australian Seniors. How are you?
[3 seconds][Customer] : Speaking good. Thanks.
[9 seconds][Agent] : That's the way the reason for the call. I was following up on your online enquiry to get some quotes for life insurance.
[16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, just going to bring up the quotes for you and of course I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have as well. Now I just have to let you know that all that recorded any advice provided is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. And just to make sure I do have your details correct in front of me, Can I have your name as Rachel Ryan? Is that the one? Yep. Uh, date of birth, 23rd of August 1974. Yep. And you are a female Australian residence. Great.
[36 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[46 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thanks very much. And if you don't mind me asking, what's made you look at getting quotes for life insurance this morning?
[55 seconds][Customer] : Just thought about it.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[56 seconds][Customer] : Because, you know, you think about when you're putting all her and the funerals and all that.
[1 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah, No, I definitely know that feeling. So we're more just thinking about, you know, making sure like final expenses will be taken care of if you were to pass away or you're looking at leaving money to. OK. Sure, no problem. Look, I'll quickly bring up some quotes for you, umm, just while I do that, I'll give you a bit of a rundown on how this policy works and what it covers. Umm, by all means, if you do have any questions, please feel free to ask.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : It's umm, basically with our life insurance. So this policy is very straightforward. It is designed to provide that financial protection for your loved ones to a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. So essentially the idea being is there to give you that bit of Peace of Mind that if anything did happen to yourself, your family or beneficiaries would still have that financial security to back on just in case. Now you can nominate up to five people as beneficiaries. So if you had a few people in mind who you'd like to leave money to, you can definitely do that. But at the end of the day, it is completely up to you where the money goes. The policy does payout triple if you were to pass away due to an accident. So we would pay three times in that case just in case there were any additional expenses like medical bills. And it does also include an advance payout for funeral. So included in the cover is an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount just to help out with funeral costs or any other final expenses at that time. Now our policy, it has been designed specifically with our seniors customers in mind. So we have simplified the application process. So because we only ask eight yes or no questions relating to a person's health in order to apply, it means that there is still the potential for people with pre-existing conditions to get accepted for the cover. That way if you are accepted, and of course once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause at all. Uh, the only thing that's not covered is just suicide in the 1st 13 months, and there is also a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So this means that if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, in that case we would pay out your claim in full while you're living. Umm. So fingers crossed you'll never need to use that, but it is there just in case. Now, the cover that we offer, it does start at $10,000 up to a maximum of 200,000 and it works in $10,000 increments. So I can look at as many options as you like. Looks like on our website you're looking at a quote for the 100,000. Is that where you'd like me to start? I'm sorry, the phone just cut out. Sorry.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, it's a bit windy area.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Oh, you're right. OK, no worries. Did you want me to start on 100,000 or would you prefer a different amount?
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, now that 100,000 is good.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Sure, let's have a look at that one. Yeah, Rachel, I just have to confirm. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I'm a smacker.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine. No problem at all. Alrighty. Well, just to give you an example, let's say if you're looking at a cover of $100,000 for yourself, it works out to be a fortnightly premium of $54.83. So that's about 27 odd dollars a week.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : And that policy that would pay $100,000 to your family or beneficiaries if you passed away or $100,000 to yourself if you were diagnosed terminally ill.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : But realistically speaking, does that sound like something that would suit your situation or?
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, Sure, no worries. If you're happy with that so far, it's pretty simple process. All I have to do is quickly run you through those eight health questions just so that we could let you know if you are eligible. And once you're approved, if you're happy to, I'll organize to send you out all the documentation so that you can take some time to read through it in your own time. Uh, just make sure that you're happy with it. Umm, yeah. They're just yes or no questions. I'd say a couple of minutes.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Now the other part to keep in mind in regards to the premium. So your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year. But I do have a projection here, so I'll just show you what that looks like. Just says here as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy next year, the fortnight big premium would be $58.67. And of course, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. Basically what happens is roughly 30 days before each policy anniversary, we do send out an updated schedule notifying you of any changes before they happen. So you'll have roughly about a month each year to re evaluate and get what you want to do. And just in case I misspoke earlier with the terminally ill, advanced payment means that if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by specialized medical practitioner, in that case, we would pay out your claim in full while you're living. Now, Rachel, I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing by you. Is that all making sense for you so far? Perfect.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Alright, I'll just quickly update your profile then I'll get straight into the questions. Can I please get your post code?
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : It's 0872.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : No worries. So did you say 0872?
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And what's the town or suburb there? Please? No worries. Let me just find that one.
