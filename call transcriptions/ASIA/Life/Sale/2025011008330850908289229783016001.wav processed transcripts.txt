[1 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Alright, let's have a, have a quick look for you. Alright, so for $30,000, so there is a few, uh, additional benefits that's gonna come included in the cover as well, but I'm more than happy to provide, uh, that pricing for you first see if it's umm, yeah, something within that's affordable for yourself. And if you're interested, just quickly run through that, uh, first question I'll need to ask you there is, umm, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? OK, no worries.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Not. Not in the last 73 years.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. Well, that's what a great healthy choice Sir. Alright, so umm, for $30,000 you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $75.14 now.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : 7514 for a fortnight.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : I can have a look at 20,000 as well if you like to serve some rough idea. I've got $50.09 and $10,000 benefit amount. Uh, something to obviously if, when, when that time does come, something to cover a funeral like that, looking at $25.05 per fortnight. OK, Were any of those options here affordable or in the price range that you're thinking of at the moment?
[3 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that seems OK to me, you know?
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, seems pretty good. Cool. Well, I'll quickly run through some of the features just so you have a full understanding of what this life insurance covers.
[3 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : But, uh, it is designed to provide the financial protection to your loved ones, to your wife through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. Now, if you were to pass away from an accident, uh, there is the accidental death, death benefit, which, umm, the chosen benefit amount will triple. So if you did go for the, uh, $30,000, you were to pass away through an accident, umm, your wife would receive $90,000 for that. Now included is an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amounts held with immediate costs like funeral expenses or any other kind of final expensive time as well. Uh, Graham, really easy to apply for Australian savings. We just asked you 8 yes or no questions, umm, related to your health over the phone, uh, just to see if you are approved. Unfortunately, not everyone is approved for, umm, life insurance.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : But hearing that you haven't, umm, your whole life, I'm sure that there won't be any issues there. But uh yeah. Just to let you know, if you are, umm, accepted, uh, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except for suicide in the 1st 13 months. Umm, additionally as well, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we're going to pay you a benefit amount in full. That's why you are still alive. You can use that money to, you know, receive medical care or really just how you'd like to spend at the time. That's, that will be paid out. I'll pause there for a moment. Did you have any questions about anything at all?
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : No.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Cool, awesome. Now keep in mind though, your premiums are stepped, which means that they will generally increase each year. I can give you a projection, umm, if you'd like, but I'll choose the benefit amount that was most suitable for yourself. So what?

[5 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : What umm sounded more most reasonable, the 30,000, the 20 or the 10?
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Oh, just just go with the 30.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK, no worries Sir. Umm, that's, uh, as an indication you make no changes to the policy. Your premium next year would be $80.40.
