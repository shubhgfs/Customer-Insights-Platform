[5 seconds][Agent] : Hi Steven, it's guy here calling from Australian Saviours Insurance. How you doing today?
[3 seconds][Customer] : Hello, good. Thanks.
[10 seconds][Agent] : That's good. I'm calling to help you with your enquiry for life insurance we've received online. I just wanted to run through some pricing and features and see if we're able to help you. Any questions along the way I'm happy to stop and answer them for you too. OK, I will just do a few quick checks. So today all calls are recorded and any advice I provide is general in nature and man of the situation there I do have Stephen Smith is your full name.
[22 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[33 seconds][Agent] : And just to confirm as well Stephen to the V OK thank you mate.
[35 seconds][Customer] : Yes, correct.
[37 seconds][Agent] : And the 7th of March 69th for your birthday and you are a male Australian resident of course.
[44 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[45 seconds][Agent] : OK thanks Dave. Just so I can understand how to best help you as well. Are you new to life insurance or have you had cover in the past?
[51 seconds][Customer] : Alright, I've had trouble since I was out 20.
[55 seconds][Agent] : OK. And is that still in plus or?
[56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK.
[1 minutes][Customer] : It's 350,000 3:50.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : And how much are you covered for 250,350? OK there. And do you have like just so I can understand what what to keep in mind when we're looking at this for you? Is the life insurance mainly for like a mortgage or is it more just for family protection at this point?
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : I have protection.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Family protection. OK, nice and simple. So with seniors, our life insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends at that age, there's no looking contract or exit fee at any time. So if you don't want to hold it that long, you don't have to. It won't cost percent to cancel, but you can also hold it all the way until 85 if you really want. OK uh, 10,000 is our minimum cover. I'm able to work up in 10,000 from there. 200,000 is the Max we offer.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep. I'd be. It would be the next.
[1 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Umm, how much would you want to apply for the 200? Yep, no worries. And there's four particular benefits without cover. If you're able to get approved to the 9 health questions and you decide to take the cover from there, you'll be immediately protected for death through to any cause straight away except for suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Yep.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Umm, realistically with us say you don't need to serve a waiting period apart from suicide not being covered in the 1st 13 months. OK, umm, the other three benefits will start straight away too. So the second one I'm gonna leave. You'll advance payment more of a living benefit in the case you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a medical practitioner that is specialized in that field. You can actually claim yourself and be paid out in full while you're living. So that's built in.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : There is an accidental death benefit too. This could be something as simple as a fault or a car accident, for example. So if you pass within 90 days of the accident 1st occurring, your selected benefit of 200,000 will be tripled to 600,000 and paid to your beneficiaries. OK. We also do Chuck in a funeral benefit in the cover. So it's all in the one place for the family. It equals 20% of your benefit amount. Umm, so that they can go and organize the funeral costs and final expenses. OK, Uh, any questions about the benefits?
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep that. Now they are pretty straightforward.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Cool, cool. And have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? OK, that's good.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : No, no, what? Yeah, I can, I can easily say in the last 55 years.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : But that's awesome. But but we only checked the last four months, so that's fine. So you haven't had a cigarette at all in the last four months? OK, very good. That'll help us with the price anyway. Safe, umm now 200,000 being the Max we can offer for $148.21 a fortnight. How does that sound for you? 148 and 21 and 21 cents fortnightly.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : But anyway, yeah, no, yeah, I gotta get some like 120, 1:48 that's 300 bucks. So that's.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 321 and 13 cents a month if you convert it to a month, please.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I work. I work in monthly.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think OK.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yep umm, with us as well, because the questions are so simple, there's no loadings or anything. Umm so like when you answer these questions, it doesn't add a price on top of that, uh, it's either you get approval with this one.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : It's very simple, OK, umm, what I'll do, I just wanna explain a little bit more about the premiums and whatnot and then I'll, I'll run you through those nine questions. It takes about a minute and 20 seconds and then I can show you your outcome. Umm with our premium on this coverage steps, which means it will increase each year. I prefer just to give you an example over the phone, you're gonna get a copy of the premium projection with your documents. Umm, but doing it over the phone allows you to ask me questions as we go just a bit easier. So I want to look at a couple of years into the future, if you don't mind the David Smith, please be aware that all of our premium projections are indicative only and assume that you do not make any amendments to your cover. So as an example, uh, the premium payable in your following year of cover will be $343.61 a month. Now the beauty about our cover is we do not decrease your coverage because you're getting older.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : It's going to stay at the 200,000 unless you specifically call and apply to decrease it yourself, OK? Uh, you can do that at any time. And if you lower your cover, your payment accordingly. So you keep that in mind for the future, OK?
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Umm, So yeah, as you can say this year per month, 3/21/13 a month for 200 grand and then next year 34361 a month for 200 grand. OK, uh, the third you would go from three 4361 a month to 367 and 66 cents a month, etcetera. Can you see the pattern happening there?
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course, that's how that works. Again, you'll get a copy of that umm, as an indication for the call. If you make no changes to the policy, you'll be $343.61 a monthly at 200 grand. And you can also find information about our premium instruction on our website too. Regardless anywhere name. OK, now, uh, what was your post code on suburb please Steve.
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep, post code is 4570 and the suburb is Southside 35 Ramsey Rd.
