[3 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. Umm now it's as you mentioned there. You you nailed it on the head. It's just to be able to leave something behind you mentioned there to your kids.
[3 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yes, 2.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Umm, how many kids do you have too? Beautiful. So making sure you know, there's a little bit of, you know, financial protection there or just be able to give them something, you know, when the when the time does come.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's right.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, so this one pays out if you were to pass away before your 86th birthday when the policy ends. OK, You can choose cover anywhere between $10,000 and $200,000.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's the one they were talking about.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. OK, umm, now you mentioned the two kids there, so you can actually nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the nominated amount.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So naming the two kids is perfectly fine there. That'll work for you Now, uh, you saw that on the ad as well.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : That's, uh, you could death restrict accidents. Your chosen benefit amount triples.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, so when your kids come to claim umm, obviously it's not a pleasant thing to think about accidental death, but umm, U. Unfortunately it could happen to any of us at any time.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Oh, God. None of us know, do we? That's the thing.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : No, of course I wish we did.
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. No, probably better. We don't, dear.
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Umm, maybe we. Yeah, that's true, true. Umm, but yeah, none of us do know. So there is that bit of extra protection if that was the case. Umm, Now what we also include is an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount you choose.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : No, right, right.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Umm, the kids can claim that nice and quickly while the rest of the money goes through the claims. OK, that can help with funeral costs.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : I know you said you've already got your, your funeral covered.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : But there will be extra costs, you know, like thing in the paper and flowers and things like that.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. So I'm.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : It's just basically the funeral that's covered, but there's always extra costs. I know with my own mother.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, unfortunately that's, uh, that's right. There's always a little bits and bobs and, and extra costs. So that's kind of why we include that, that option, umm, to, for the kids to receive that, they don't actually need to provide us with a certificate. It's just something like a sign note from a professional.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Umm, let's say you passed away. They can actually get that money within 24 to 48 hours.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Umm now with the the rest of the money, umm going through the claims process or the claims team are all based here in Australia.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Oh, good. Yes. Yep.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : We're all under the same roof here in the OK umm to give you a little piece bit of Peace of Mind there as well.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Mine. Yes.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Umm now obviously they're, they're dedicated to making sure that process is as as simple and easy as possible. On average, we actually pay claims six days faster than the industry benchmark as well.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Absolutely yes.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So around 75 days versus 81 days.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, now it's super easy, everything's done over the phone. There's no medicals, blood tests, anything like that.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : No, as I said, I've got nothing in here wrong with me.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Umm, it, it's just a no, of course, of course.
[6 minutes][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Always, always good to hear umm, keeping your health in check.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but we, yeah, we just take you through a yes or no questions relating to health over the phone.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : That's the way we just check it. If you are improved to cover.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK Now if you're accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you are covered immediately for death due to any cause.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : All right. Yes.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : The only thing that's not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah. Well, that's that's normal, isn't it? Yep.
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. Now another thing we include. It's not pleasant to think about. I hope you never have to use it, of course, but it's a terminally ill advanced payment.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes. Well, that's a good idea. Yeah.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : What it means is, yeah, it it essentially it's a way that you can claim on your own benefit amount if you were to fall I'll.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, yeah, yes.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, that's when you can come to us yourself and we can pay out your claim instead of still living.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Oh, right. Yeah, that's how that works.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, Yep. If you need.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So I guess instead of, you know, waiting until the time does come and leaving it to your beneficiary, it gives you the chance to access that early. Yeah.
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah- Yeah.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Put your own plans in place or, you know, use it towards medical bills, whatever it might be.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, How does that all sound so far?
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that sounds excellent. Yes, because that I've been looking at this thing quite a few years and I'm finally just sitting here relaxing today and I thought I must ring up about this. Yeah, I know I'm old now, but God willing, I mean, most, a lot of people, God willing, are living a lot longer.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, of course, absolutely.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : So I thought, well, probably, but it depends on the cost too, as most things do. Yes.
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Of course, as, uh, as most things do nowadays, I'm, I'm afraid, umm, but let's jump into that for you. Umm, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months, Susan?
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : No, I've never smoked. No.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : No perfect. Umm, nice healthy life choice.
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I try. True.
[7 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, easy on the wallet as well from I see, from what I see. But that does make an impact on the premiums as well. So let's have a look at that one now between 10,000 and $200,000. You mentioned you were leaving just, I guess a little bit behind to the two kids there.
[8 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : What amount do you think is going to be most necessary for you?
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Well, I probably thought about 15,000.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah. So with this one here.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : I, I, I, you know, I need to be guided a bit because I don't really, you know, I haven't thought a lot about it's, it's really going on. The cost of it. That's what you know. Oh, right.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely. So with this one here, you can go in increments of 10,000. So umm yeah. So what we'll do, let's have a look at yeah that that would both work nicely. Umm, we'll start there and see what that looks like for you. Umm, we can always drop that down to 10 if we need to.
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : That'd be 20,000 because I've got two kids, yes.
[8 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Umm you do have flexibility with the level of cover as well, so you wanted to reduce that. Umm, whilst you hold the policy, you can do so just by giving us a call. Umm, our support team will take you through what that looks like. Umm, if you wanted to take out additional cover, you can do that as well in the form of a a new top up policy that's obviously subject to the application again and as long as you're still an Australian resident and fit the age criteria as well.
[9 minutes][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, But if we're looking at the $20,000 of cover, it comes out to be a fortnightly premium $34.67.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep. Yeah. 34.
[9 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, How does that one sound there? Is that sounding like it's affordable?
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that sounds OK. Yeah. What would the 10,000 be?
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Can you just tell me that?
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So if I oops, Yep. So if I drop that down to 10,000, it's $17.33 for that one.
[9 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : 17? Yeah. And did you say that benefit double S or something with being off the television or what did you say? What?
[9 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So it's accidental.
[10 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Oh, oh God, yes, yes. Yep.
[10 minutes][Agent] : So if you're death with an accident, so I say you're in a car accident or something like that, God forbid, but that's when that that 10,000 will become 30,000. So triples.
[10 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Oh, right, yeah, no, I think I'd just go. I think I'd be better to just go for the 10,000.
[10 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. OK, let's leave that.
[10 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : It'd be something at least, you know, they're both not too bad off, but at least it'd be something.
[10 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : I have to really do what, you know, for my own. Cos you said that's fortnightly.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : And it's been yeah, that's fortnightly.
[10 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep. Yeah.
[10 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep. OK, perfect.
[10 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : And I could manage that with the pension, I mean, you know. Yeah.
[10 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Now, if, if that one's sounding suitable there, umm, what we'll do is take you through those health questions just to confirm if you're eligible for cover and then I'll give you options from there.
[10 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep.
[10 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Umm, what was your home address, please? Susan Craigmore and the five one, four. OK.
[10 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : 16 Christine Circuit, Craigmoor 5114 South Australia The other thing I was just gonna ask you like there was something flashed up there and I didn't see it pop. Well, I read a bit of it. When you're 85, does it just go until you're 85 or what happens then?
[11 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So essentially the the insurance is in place until that point. Obviously if you were to pass away, it's it's kind of there for the unexpected as well. Yeah. So it's kind of that protection.
[11 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, but it's only goes until you're 85, doesn't it?
[11 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's correct.
[11 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Is that what you mean?
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : That's correct.
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : You don't, you know? Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. No. Well, that's T Yeah, no, that's alright.
[11 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, absolutely. There's no, umm, there's no locking contracts, there's no exit or hidden costs either.
[11 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Cos you can cancel it if you decided at anytime, can't you cops either? No, that's what I thought was just saying is yeah.
[11 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, so if you do want to cancel, you can do so at any time. Just give us a call and we'll run you through that process. Umm, now that home address you gave me, is that the same as your postal address as well?
[12 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, dear. Yes, yeah.
[12 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. OK, I'll copy that one across there.
