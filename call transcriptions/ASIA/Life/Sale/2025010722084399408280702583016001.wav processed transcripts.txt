[4 seconds][Agent] : Oh, hi there, Carolyn. My name's Amy. I'm calling from Australian Seniors Insurance. How are you?
[9 seconds][Customer] : I'm good, thank you.
[11 seconds][Agent] : That's good to hear. I'm giving you a call in regards to the inquiry that's been popped through for the life insurance that we do have here. So I'm here to help you with that. I will just make sure we have the right details that have come through from online and I'll let you know our calls are recorded. Any advice that I do provide, it is generally nature may not be suitable to your situation. I have your name here as Ms. Carolyn Noble, is that correct?
[34 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it's Mrs. Carolyn Noble.
[37 seconds][Agent] : Oh, thank you. I'll update that. So Mrs. Carolyn Noble, thank you. And I have your date of birth, the 30th of the 3rd, 1955.
[44 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[46 seconds][Agent] : And you are a female Australian resident as well?
[49 seconds][Customer] : Sorry.
[50 seconds][Agent] : You're a female Australian resident as well, is that right?
[52 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yes, I'm a citizen.
[54 seconds][Agent] : Thank you.
[54 seconds][Customer] : Australian citizen.
[56 seconds][Agent] : Oh, beautiful. So you're a citizen of Australia, currently residing in Australia. Yep.
[1 minutes][Customer] : Yes, I didn't.
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : And your gender is female, is that right?
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : I didn't, sorry.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : And your agenda is female.
[1 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. So what I'll do is explain the main features and benefits and then we'll run through some pricing together with the seniors life insurance. It is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 86th birthday when the policy ends. So instead of coverage during that sensitive time period, perhaps there's a little bit of mortgage leftover or loans, or you just want to offer some financial support. You can choose cover between 10,000 up to 200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount. Now if death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit amount will triple and we also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. Now it's very easy to apply. We just ask you a yes or no questions related to your help over the phone to see if you are approved. So there's no medical checks or blood tests or having to remember a lifetime of medical history.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : None.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : And once approved and you commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for deaths you to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the covers. If you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, they can pay your benefit amount in full to help with medical costs to ensure that you receive the best care possible.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Now we'll have a look at some pricing. Any questions about any of that so far, Carolyn?
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : No, it's OK. That's fine.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : No worries. Now to begin, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? That's OK. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : I'm sorry I didn't get you a cigarette.
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : I can be very good. I just said yes or no for that one.
[3 minutes][Customer] : No, I don't smoke and no.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much. So we can have a look at cover between 10,000 up to 200,000. We can look at as many different amounts as you'd like to find the right level for you, But where would you like to start? 100,000 Sure.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : I'd like to start with, OK, 100, yeah.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So for $100,000 cover, that comes to a fortnightly premium of $132.23?
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Can I get that amount again, please?
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure, A fortnightly premium of $132.23. How does that sound, $0.23?
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : One 132 and $0.22 20-3 cents.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right. That's OK. Sometimes it's hard to hear the numbers over the phone.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Sorry how much is the if I pay? Is there any discount or if I pay it yearly?
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Great question. There's no additional discount if you do pay it annually. So it's whatever. It's just most convenient for you. If you would like to pay that annually, you can. Or if it's more convenient for you to pay monthly or fortnightly, that's an option for you as well. MMM. Yeah, sure. What amount?
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : OK, how about for can I, can I ask you for I'll go down Yes and let's say 50,000.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. So for 50,000, that brings the fortnightly premium to $66.12, which equates to only $4.72 per day. So how does that sound, $0.12 per fortnight? Does that sound more manageable for you?
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : $66 and $0.20 and and this and this is 50 grand, isn't it?
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's $50,000.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. And this one here is 100,000. Let's say I'll go in the middle and I can you give me a quote for 75, please?
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : I can do 70 or 80.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : 0780, please.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Sure. So the $80,000 cover comes to a fortnightly premium of $105.79.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, All right. And then what will you once I close the deal, will you, will I get a confirmation or will you send the brochure or something like that?
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yes, so all of the information gets sent out there for you so that you can, umm, start to review. We'll check to see if you're eligible as well. Uh, in addition, we also provide you with the free online legal will, which is valued at $160.00 with each policy and a complimentary subscription of Australian Seniors Dare magazine.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Now your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year. So as an indication, so if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $113.20 per fortnight. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. So that's going based off of the 80,000.
[6 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So for example, that's the $105.79 per fortnight at the age of 69. At the age of 70, that would then be 100 and 1320.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK. So E every every year it comes up.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : That's right.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : It depends on how old you are.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yes, that's right.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So it's calculated each year following your policy anniversary. So your age policy anniversary, you do get made on a month prior to those changes each year. So you have the time to go through and accommodate for those changes. So which amount do you think you're leaning most towards at the moment, the 50,080 thousand or 100,000 or sorry, was it 150? We were looking at 100,000.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Uh, I'm looking, I'm really looking at 100,000 but I I have to think about it when I have to compute it one 2012 2223 * 2 * 12.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : No. So it's not times 2 * 12 what it is times 26. So it'll be 3000.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : I'm 26.
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yes, because it's the fortnights, because there's a slight more frequency in fortnights throughout the year in comparison to the month. So the annual premium is $3438.04, so 3438.04.
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK, 24382. OK, but how about for 80,000 annual?
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, let's have a look. So 80,000, that would be $2750.43, so 275 O .43.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK?
[8 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : And then did you want to look at 50,000 as well?
[8 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Sure, that would be $1719.02, so 1719.02.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK, I get that. Oh, OK. I'll think about it.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, definitely I can get it all sent out for you.
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : And, uh, will you be giving me brochure, as you said, sending it and then I have to go to it?
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : I'll send that out for you now.
[9 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, thank you very much.
[9 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : What I'll do as well is I'll take you through a more check to see if you are definitely eligible for the cover uh, and then I can let you know the options that are available to you here now. I'll grab your address.
[9 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK, it's four. Yeah.
[9 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So, uh, if you are accepted, I can get documentation sent out. Future review. Was there one amount that you were leaning most towards between the three, the 5080 or 100? You said of you were kind of leading most towards the 100,000. Is that right?
[9 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Alright, 88, yeah, but then, uh, it's 3430 and it goes up, up, up.
[9 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : You do have the option to, umm, decrease your level of cover over time if you would like us all to accommodate UMM, but if you want to sell the lower level of coverage to accommodate for the future increases, you can do that as well. Whatever is most convenient for you. Sure, let's have a look now.
[9 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : OK, so maybe I'll go for 80 address.
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : I'll grab your address. Let me just bring that up. I'll start with your post code and suburb first if I can.
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : It's Kondell park 22 double O NSW.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. So 22 Double O Condell Park and your street address there. Thank you. And is that your home and postal address?
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, I live in a villa so it's 4 stroke 1 Kardella court with a KKARDE double LA court, yes.

[13 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, very good. All right, Carol, and that is all done there for us, so I can let you know. Congratulations, your application has been approved, which is great to see. So what I can do is I can leave you with that general information with the quote.
[14 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh.
[14 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Alternatively, because you do have this approval, you have the option to be able to have cover in place from today. So what that would look like is you would be covered from today. I would send out all of their personalized policy documentation for you to start to review. And this policy does give you a 30 day cooling off period to decide if the policy is suitable for you. So if you decide for any reason that it's not suitable, if you cancel within 30 days from your first payment, then you will receive a full refund of your premium unless the claim has been made. And you're also not required to make any payment today. So we choose a future collection day that would suit you best, but you still get the coverage from today. So does that second option actually sound better for you?
[14 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : None, and it's how you call this one. You mean to say I'll be, umm, I'll be insured from today?
[14 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So you would be insured from today, but you're not required to make any payment today. We can choose a collection day anywhere from today up to 30 days in the future. And I'll get all of your documentation sent out to your e-mail within about 15 minutes.
[15 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[15 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So you're happy with that second option?
[15 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : What's the second option again?
[15 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : The second option is having the cover in place.
[15 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Having the cover in place.
[15 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So first option is just the general information that I've sent out to you with the quote.
[15 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh.
[15 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Second option is getting to have cover in place from today. We choose a collection day that suits you best and I send all of your personalized policy documents for you to start to review.
[15 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, that's fine.
[15 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Sure. So you're happy with the second option.
[15 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[15 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. And when would be the best collection day for you?
[15 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Maybe next month, it's within 30 days you said, isn't it?
[16 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Anywhere from today up to 30 days in the future. So if you do want it to be next month, we can do that.
[16 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Oh, so it will be fee for March.
[16 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Do you have a particular day going to be 4 weeks from today, which is the 5th of February, 5th of March, on November 2? Monthly.
[16 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Uh, is it I, I And so it will be uh, if I pay it annual because I'm looking at annual, not not fortnightly and not, not monthly yet. Yeah, yearly.
[16 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So do you want that to be for nightly or monthly or annual?
[16 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yearly.
[16 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yearly, Annually.
[16 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, annually, yeah.
[16 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, so that would be the $2750.43. So do you want that to be on the 5th of February or the the I think the latest that we could do that would be I think the 8th of February. Are you happy for me to do the 8th or the 6th of February?
[17 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : 6th to 8th of February before I decide and and I'd like to talk to my son. Is that fine? Is that OK?
[17 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, definitely. So with that first option, I can just send you that general information. And with the second option, you still have the opportunity to speak to your family and do everything you need to do, but it does give you cover whilst doing so. And as mentioned, you're not required to pay anything today, so we would put that collection day in for you. But if you change your mind for any reason prior to that or if you need to rearrange the payment day, then you can do so as well moving forward.
[17 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Oh oh, alright, I agree to that. Thank you.
[17 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, So when would be the best collection day for you then that we can set for you today?
