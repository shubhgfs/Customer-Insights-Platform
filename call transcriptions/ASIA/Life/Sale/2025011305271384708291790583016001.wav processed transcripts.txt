[2 seconds][Agent] : Hi there, Arlene, it's Sharon calling you back from Australian Seniors Insurance. How are you? No, that's good. I was just following up again once more for the life insurance enquiry that we were discussing earlier this month.
[1 seconds][Customer] : Hello, I'm fine OK.
[15 seconds][Agent] : So I'm just essentially here to, you know, continue along with the application process for that wonderful. Just so we can revisit very quickly and again, letting you know that our calls are recorded and any advice I provide is generally in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. And Elaine, if you could just say your name and date of birth for me once more, please. Mm hmm.
[37 seconds][Customer] : My name is Arvind Kalabager and my birthday is on April 2, 1969.
[46 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you very much, Arlene. It's just a form of ID that we use on each new call. If I may. It is just a little bit hard hearing you at the moment, if you are able to speak up just a tiny bit, if that's OK. Thank you so much. Much better. So I remember we did discuss that looking at the 200,000, I had that sent out to you and we were pretty much just waiting to go through the application process. But did you get a chance to read through the quote that I had sent out? Perfect, perfect. And still happy with everything as well.
[57 seconds][Customer] : OK, Uh, yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful. All right, well, let's take you through the application. It should only take us a couple of minutes. And then once we've got an approval, we'll be able to discuss the options that we have available for you. Now, I've already confirmed your e-mail, so it was carlo.eileen@yahoo.com.
[1 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[1 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : And then in case you get approved for the insurance, we also like to have it sent out via post. I'll just pop in. What would be your post code first there, Eileen? 2430, you said? Yeah. And what was the town or suburb for you then?
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : 240 Zero Yeah.
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Oh, no. So the like the suburb, the town. Alba.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : NSW Old Bar Yeah.
[2 minutes][Agent] : Let's have a look here. Just going through the list. There we go, Alba. And then just the street number and street name for you, Eileen.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Kirkwood St. 6 Kirkwood St. Old Bar.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Clerkwood over there. And how did I spell the street?
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Umm, CORK wood.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Ah ah, Corkwood, Sorry, that's my fault. I misheard you, but there we go #6 Corkwood St. in Old Barn, NSW.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Cork wood, correct?
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : And that's the same as your postal address as well, correct?
[2 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Wonderful. All right, that's everything there. OK, So just to revise, looking at $200,000 of life insurance coming in at a monthly premium of $222.22. We'll take you to the application and then we'll see what we can do for you there, Arlene. So, umm, just while I'm loading up the questions, I'll need to read out to you what's called a pre underwriting disclosure. Uh, so it'll just be a statement that makes you aware of your responsibility, of course, before answering the questions.
[3 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, so just to see and of course as a reminder, please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes. We collect your personal information to provide insurance quotes you should cover and other related services. We will share this with your insurer and make sure with other Australian service providers for the purpose of administering your policy or handling claims. Our privacy policy tells you more, including how to access and correct your information and lodge complaints about breaches of privacy. By proceeding, you understand that you are applying to purchase a life insurance policy and as such, you have a duty to take reasonable care to not make any misrepresentations. This means that you need to ensure that you understand each question I ask you and that you provide honest, accurate and complete answers. You need to answer each question in full, even if you have provided some information to us in any earlier discussions you have had. If you do not take reasonable care, you may breach your duty. And if this happens, your insurer may be entitled to cancel your policy, decline a claim, or make adjustments to the terms and conditions of your policy. So Arlene, with that being said, I'll just confirm, do you understand and agree to your duty, yes or no?
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : That is 200 something monthly.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So just before I revisit that there, Arlene, just so I can confirm it for the sake of the recording that statement that I just read you out there, do do you understand what I read out to you there and do you agree to your duty to take reasonable care? OK, perfect. Now I just have to make sure that's all. But yes, we were looking. So it was $200,000 of life insurance at a monthly premium of $222.22.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, OK. And do I need to pay that now? No.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : No, no, no, no. So what we're doing at the moment is I'm reading out that pre underwriting disclosure just to make you aware of your responsibility before you answer our application questions. Once we have gone through the application, if you're approved, we can have you covered today, but it won't cost you anything upfront. You'll be able to pick your first payment date yourself. OK, you there, Arlene?
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Oh, sorry, just cut out for a second. OK, well, we'll go through the questions here. So the way this will work, I'll read the question out to you in full first. I'll then just ask yes or no. You respond accordingly and we should be able to move through fairly quickly. So the first one is asking, have you been hospitalised for COVID-19 in the last six months or have you been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last seven days? Yes or no?
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : No.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Very good. And in the last five years, have you been admitted to hospital as an inpatient because of a heart attack, heart failure or a stroke? Yes or no? Yep. In the last five years, have you been admitted to hospital as an inpatient because of a lung disease? Other than for asthma or pneumonia as the only conditions, no. In the last five years have you been diagnosed with or treated for any of the following cancers? Lung cancer, cancer of the esophagus, stomach or pancreas cancer, brain cancer, multiple myeloma or any other cancer that has spread to other organs? Or are you currently or soon to be treated with chemotherapy? No, very good. And do you have a renal kidney condition that currently requires dialysis or transplant or a doctor has advised will be required in the future? No Perfect. And do you have a liver condition that will require a transplant in the future? No Very good. Have you been diagnosed with or currently undergoing testing for, or has a doctor advised you to be tested for motor neurone disease or any form of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease? No. In the last five years have you attempted suicide or been hospitalised for a mental health condition?
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Very good. And then finally, Arlene, this one's just confirming. Are you experiencing any unexplained symptoms or are you currently undergoing or waiting for the results of any health related tests or investigations or being diagnosed as having 12 months or less to leave? Yes or no, Beautiful. OK, that is the application done and dusted there. I appreciate going through that with me and perfect. It has bounced back immediately. I'm sure you can imagine as well-being so healthy that you have been approved for the life insurance. So congratulations, Ali.
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No, thank you.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK. But yes, that means now that we know that you can take the insurance out, we can work together to get you covered there as well. As I said, it's just to revise and a bit bit of a refresher. Once you start the policy, it is coverage immediately for death due to any 'cause it's just suicide in the 1st 13 months that isn't covered. OK, all right. Not to mention the terminal illness benefit, the advance payment that I mentioned and the accidental death benefit where it triples. So that's all inclusive and that's what you can be covered for today. So with that being said, now that we know that you can take this out, Arlene, were you happy to get covered for the 200,000?
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Uh, yeah.
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, I'll load up the final steps for us today. That way I can take you through and we can have you protected and we can get all of the information out to you in full. The only other thing, and I'll just double check, I have covered all of the information for you there too. I always like making sure I do as thorough a job as I can. OK, beautiful. Well look, just in case I didn't cover it, just as I like making sure I always go over everything. The premiums, I believe we did cover it, but they are stepped just meaning that they will increase each year. And to show you an indication or an idea of what that looks like next year for the $200,000 this is giving you make no changes to the policy it works in at $237.78 per month in the following year.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So there is an increment.
[9 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yes, so it does increase, but we send you a notice each year 30 days before your policy anniversary. So you will always get a heads up in what it will look like before it actually occurs, OK, OK. And if you are curious, you can also find more information about the premium structure on our website. But with all of that being and gone through now everything that we have discussed, I mean in terms of life insurance, it's all been understood and you're happy with it.
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. I received also the letter, the e-mail right, OK.
[9 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, yes, I believe you would have received that. Yeah, perfect. But yes, what we can do today. So we'll get the policy documents set and sent out to you. So you'll get an e-mail today and you'll get the physical copies about two to five business days from here. But that will be all of your policy documents. And as I said, you'll be covered as of today. So what we do, we jump into the calendar together. As I said, you will get to select the first payment date yourself, and then we note down a payment method so when the day rolls around, we can keep your insurance up to date. And then I'll just need to read out a final declaration for you, which summarizes the policy in a more formal matter. OK, wonderful. All right. Well, in the next coming days or weeks, Arlene, when would you like to select the first payment date?
[10 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : On the 30th, Yep.
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : 30th of January, I can certainly do that. Let me just jump in here. And that way it's just every month on the 30th is easy for you.
[10 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Now I'm very much the same. I do either towards the end or the beginning of the month, it's easy to remember. OK, so we'll have it the 30th of January 2025 as the first collection day and moving forward every month on the 30th. And then Arlene, the two options for a payment method that we have is either using a direct debit from a BS be an account number or you can use a card which would you prefer colour. Yeah. OK, let me swap this over here. Now before you relay any information to me, I'll let you know that for security purposes while obtaining your card details, the call recording will stop and we'll recommence after we have collected your details. OK.
[11 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : A credit card, OK.
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : All right. So I'm just going to. And please be advised that the call recording has now resumed for quality and monitoring purposes. So that is everything to cover for you there. Arlene, just before I go to the final step and read out the declaration here, was there any other questions you had for me for the time being? 85, yes, yes, correct. So the life insurance.
[13 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : What I understand, yeah, I have to pay that up to the age of 80, 85 and there's its a life insurance, right, Yeah and times for the accident and that there's no hospitalization on it, yeah.
[13 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : No, Sir, As we established last time, it's not like a health cover, like a hospital cover. It's just a life insurance aspect there. But we do have the health insurance team, It's just not my department. But you can definitely have a chat with them. They may have something that lines up more with that aspect.
[13 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[13 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Any other questions?
[13 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : No, thank you.
[13 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Well, OK, that's OK. All right, So bear with me just while I read this out, there'll be one question in the middle, 2 at the end, and we'll have you covered from there. OK, so it just says here. Thank you. Arlene Bagger.
