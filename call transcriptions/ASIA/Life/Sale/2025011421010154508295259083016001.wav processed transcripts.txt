[3 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[4 seconds][Agent] : Hi, good morning there, Robert. My name is Amy. I'm calling from Australian Seniors Insurance. How are you?
[10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, next question.
[14 seconds][Agent] : I'm giving you a call in regard to the inquiry that's been popped through for the life insurance that we do have here. So I'm here to help you with that.
[20 seconds][Customer] : No, goodness me, that's quick.
[22 seconds][Agent] : Yes, that could be as efficient as possible, but I just happen to be available when you were the first one in line. So, so umm, I'll just make sure we have the right details that have come through from online and let you know our calls are recorded. Any advice that I do provide, it is general in nature. It may not be suitable to your situation.
[40 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I'll work.
[40 seconds][Agent] : I have your name here as Mr. Robert Reed, Is that correct?
[44 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's correct.
[45 seconds][Agent] : And I have your date of birth, the 10th of the 7th, 1953.
[49 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's correct.
[50 seconds][Agent] : Very good. And you are a male Australian resident as well.
[53 seconds][Customer] : It is.
[54 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Now what I'll do is explain the main features and benefits and then we'll run through some pricing together with the seniors life insurance.
[1 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : It's been designed to fill a bit of a gap in the market for seniors looking into life insurance, and it's there to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday. When the policy ends, you can choose cover between 10,000 up to 200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the nominated amount. If death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit amount will triple and as part of the policy we also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses of the time.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Now we've made it very easy to apply so we specialize in life insurance for over 50s and rather than sending you off a medical checks or blood tests or having you remember a lifetime of medical history, we just ask you a yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you're approved.
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, if you are accepted and once you commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. In addition, there's a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we will pay the benefit amount out to in full to help with medical costs to ensure that you receive the best care possible.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, wow.
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, uh, we also provide you with a free online legal will which is valued at $160.00 with each policy. So if you're updating will or if you haven't created 1 yet, they help you from start to finish. We also provide a complimentary subscription of Australian Seniors Day magazine with each policy. So we'll have a look at some pricing together to begin. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? A very good idea. Is it a yes or no for that one there?
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : That's right. I'll start it now.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. We can have a look at cover between 10,000 up to 200,000 as mentioned. So what benefit amount would you like for me to select for you?
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : I'm trying. Let's see, I'm in the middle, probably 100.
[3 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Let's have a look and we can look at as many different amounts as you'd like to find the right level for you. For $100,000 cover that comes to a fortnightly premium of $218.77. How does that sound?
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Excuse me? Yeah. That's not it.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Would you like to look at any other levels of cover?
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : That's not it to them, Yeah. Can you give me a quote for, say, 80?
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. So 80,000 that comes to a fortnightly premium of $175.02. So that sound more manageable.

[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Well, hopefully it, you know, it, it gets itself a little bit better sooner, but I understand, you know, wanting to make sure that there's something in place, umm, you know, for Peace of Mind. So I'll take you through. We'll check to see if you're eligible. Umm, now your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be a fortnightly premium of. Let me just bring that up, $187.27.
