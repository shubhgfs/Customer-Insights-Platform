I I mean growing up as you grow older, I mean as your age, grow up and it will go up as well until you barely can afford anymore. Yeah. I think that's that's common knowledge to everyone.

[2 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : And OK. So with your current life cover, how much are you paying at the moment?
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : It's that for myself, I guess this is for both of us, but for myself it's 152 something.
[3 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK. For a month or a fortnight, fournight. OK. And for how much benefit amount are you covered?
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : I think for a fortnight, like I think it's 490-8000.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : 490-8000, So 498,000, you're covered. So around 500,000. OK, no problem.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yeah, yeah, I don't like that.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, I see.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : And so you're just wanting to see what you can get better, umm, with the pricing and also obviously for that financial protection for your loved ones in case anything happens to you as well. Is that right?
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yes. Plus we do have a mortgage, things like that. So that's what started with when we took out our mortgage and everything like that. It's just started with like 50,000 and then it went up to almost five. Yeah, 500.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : I the terms and conditions of the bank account. Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : But the premium is getting high and we, we just like to revisit if this is still within, I mean within our financial capability to maintain this or not, things like that.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Are you gonna drop where are you gonna direct debit? Understand. And so when you say, umm, with the, the mortgage, you're, you're obviously wanting to have this cover your current mortgage. And yeah, so how, how much do you have left for your mortgage to pay off?
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Alright, yes, it's 200 or less than 200.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, 200 a thousand less than 200 a thousand.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's good to hear. That's getting, you know, less and less as you, you know, pay off. And so for, for this cover with your, sorry, your current one, is it mainly just for life cover or is there any other covers that's included?
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : There are some benefits like when you are redundant, when you get sick, things like that. And yeah, it's, it's just like minimal like, and they are extended period of one month, those basic things, 30 days, 30 days.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Did you say stand period of how many months, 24 months that that?

[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So is that, is that like an income protection that you're talking about here?
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think so. Sorry.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Oh, oh, OK. Right. Because just so you know, umm, this is obviously separate products. So this is the cover that, umm, if you're looking for life cover, that's different to umm with that income protection where you have that, uh, like to protect your income. So it's different.
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. Mm hmm.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, So this is purely just life cover and it's designed to provide you that piece of mind if you're looking for that, umm, you know, to help with the financial umm, heart for your loved ones as you were to pass away. So see it as a, you know, death benefit. Is that what you're after?
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. I just want to see options like like what I've seen. So if if this insurance is just for when you you pass away and you have something or what if you are diagnosed with terminal illness or things like that, are you not covered?
