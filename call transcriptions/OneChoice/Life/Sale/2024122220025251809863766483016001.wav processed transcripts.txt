So thanks for going online earlier this morning to do the quote with us. You're up quite early this morning. If you don't mind me asking, what has made you decide to look at some life insurance? Yeah, of course. That's a great reason to be looking into cover. When you mentioned family, are you talking about like kids or a partner or are you talking about siblings? Mum and dad. Siblings, Ye.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Just because there will be oh, just good for the family, just siblings and leasing in it.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, you do have nieces and nephews. That's nice.
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, just to pay anything.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, so no kids of your own just yet that you just want to be able to prepare for the future if anything happens to you, you can leave some money behind for them so they can look after your nieces and nephews. OK. And look, you know, when it does come to life insurance, I mean, you get to choose who you're leaving that money behind you.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So if things change in the future and then you have a family of your own, it's as simple as updating the beneficiary form, OK. And then you can leave that money behind for your own kids when that time does come. And are you 18 at the moment? How many brothers and sisters do you have? Brothers and sisters? Or do you mean nieces and nephews?
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think just off the top of my head, I think about team, I think brothers and sisters.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Wow, you've got a messy family. That would be nice this time of year for Christmas and New Year.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Do you all get together?
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Chit Chi ah, no, it's TC percent nice.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Oh, yeah, I'm the same. So yes, I'm, I'm the same when it does come to my family as a a couple of different sides of the family, like different, you know, different mums. So yeah, look, some of us are close and some of us aren't. I assume that's totally the same for you.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, it is the same.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. So it happens. So I guess when there's different families coming together.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So I'll go through some information with you and explain to the policy and how it works. It is designed to be able to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. So the benefit amount that you choose that could be used to help house a new loans or debts, even if you don't have them now and say later on, you know, you might have a, a loan when it does come to like a car or like a package, those sorts of, umm, even a personal line, the, the life insurance can help support those sort of, uh, those sorts of debts if you were to pass away.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Oh cool.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK. And then basically with the life insurance, it's there for some Peace of Mind that if anything happens to you, you know that your family is supported and they've got that financial security. So when it does come to yourself, you're talking about your siblings, you know that they're OK and they've got that money there. Look after your nieces and nephews as well and support their own families. You do get to choose up to five people to be able to receive the amount when you pass away. And like I mentioned, that nomination can be updated at any time. OK. And then your loved ones do get to request an advance pay out of $10,000 to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses that you might have. Sometimes it can be quite a difficult time on the family, not just emotionally but also financially to come up with money to pay for a funeral, especially if death is quite sudden. So with our policy, they can request that advance payout and it's generally paid stand with one within one business day of receiving the relevant documentation. So then you've also got that piece of mind as well with the policy, OK.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, that sounds good.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : And we do keep everything very simple for you. So everything is done over the phone. There's no forms that you need to fill in.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : I see. Yep.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : You don't need to see a doctor either. Yeah, what I simply do is go through some questions about your health and lifestyle. They generally have some questions and they'll confirm whether you can get cover with us. They'll also confirm the final price in terms of the policy.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that sounds good.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I'll bring up, I'll bring up some. I'm glad. I'll bring up some quotes now for you. We'll go to a quote and you can let me know how it all sounds. So just a quick question about your smoking status. First, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep, vape.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, me too. OK.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : It just started vaping this year.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : I think I just started. It's one of those things when I just started, it's hard to stop. I'm exactly the same. So with the vaping, we have to answer yes to this question for you, OK. Would you consider it as a cigarette? And then is your current annual income $50,000 or more?
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think we'll pay you. OK. One start, Mixy.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, not a card. This would be about your annual salary you'd like if you're working at the moment or not.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Oh, last start the mixy started job I just finished studying.
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK Did you have what did you finish, like school or did you do a course?
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sort of like Corsair E30 just for carpentry.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Oh, yeah, that's good. So is your current annual income $50,000 and more? That would be a no for this question. Is that correct? OK, thank you. And then you do get to choose a benefit amount from $100,000 up to a maximum of $1 million. What amount would you like me to quote you on?
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : How much would it take a month? Monthly. The full 500?
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : You're looking at 500,000. OK. We do fortnightly months to annual premium. So just to confirm, you'd prefer it monthly, is that right? OK, so for $500,000 to cover the monthly premium is $113.46. How does that sound?
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, not too bad. What about the 100?
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, let's have a look. You can go in between that. So if you want to look at 250,100 thousand, then you can. And at a later date when you are working, I know you mentioned at the moment you're going to be starting a job next year. So once you are like earning a little bit more money and feel like you can afford a bit more and you want more cover, you just have to give us a call. You can apply to increase the level of cover up into the age of 70 subject to eligibility other time. OK. So if you're looking at 100,000, that would be a monthly premium of $22.69. And then another example for you at 250,000 is a monthly premium of $56.73.
[8 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Oh Y yeah, this is oh Oh yeah, I might just start off with 100 and just slowly increase it as I get older.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK. So 100,000 dollars, $22.69 is the indicative amount per month. And then what I'll do is I'll go through the house and last questions with you.
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Sweet.
[8 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, thank you. So you've already got a job job lined up for yourself. That's pretty good. That's good. So you finished.
