Now with the policy here, you will be covered for death or due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months.

[18 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, got it.
[18 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Now in addition there for yourself, Nathan, you're touching base back on that terminally ill advanced payment that I did mention that is included within your cover. What it means there for yourself is if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we would actually pay the benefit amount out to yourself in full. And so we like to call our living benefit here at One Choice. So with that money then, Nathaniel, this is where you can actually do with what you see fit with the money. So whether there'll be a go on one last holiday or tick up a bucket list, or even just to get the best kit possible while you do go through what you go through that choice then Nathaniel, it would be entirely up to yourself and we wouldn't tell you how to spend a single cent of it.

[19 minutes][Agent] : Yes.
[19 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[19 minutes][Agent] : So terminally you would diseases, yes. And with this one here, please be aware that your premium is stepped which means it will generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation.

So with that being said, there for yourself Nathaniel, as you were approved there, there were no changes and that premium did remain at the $31.17 a four month, sorry there for yourself and that one is all completed and approved there for yourself. So that was the best case that you could have gotten. I know that you certainly were wanting something emailed out to yourself and that's certainly something that I can provide for yourself there.
[19 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Alright, Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : I do just wanna let you know of both the options that you do have there in that instance there as I know that you don't you don't currently have. You were wanting to get some cover in place there for yourself.

[20 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So they will be a tailored policy documents for yourself. And with that one there, we don't actually require any upfront cost or payments from yourself. You pay. So what I'm able to do there for yourself is I can actually pop down a preferred payment day in the near future if there's any pay cycles or bill cycles you're wanting to link it up to, as well as taking down that preferred payment method. We pop those two in there for yourself and I'll send all the policy documents out for yourself there. And while you are sitting down and reviewing that one there for yourself. Miss annual comparing with a A, If you do find that the comparison that you're like in the sounds of A A more, you're simply just unhappy. You don't know what to proceed with our cover there. You can actually simply call us and apply to have that one cancelled or we don't have any locked in contracts or any cancellation fees that you would be subject to. Does that option sound better for you there?
