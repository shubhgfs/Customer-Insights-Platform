So I do just want to say if you are replacing existing policy, we do recommend that you do not cancel it until you have reviewed this policy in full as it may not be identical to your existing cover. But what our life insurance is designed to do is quite simply provide the financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment. If you were to pass away now without benefit, it could be used to help maintain their lifestyle, pay out for mortgage or simply any other cost involved in raising a family. So basically it's just there for that Peace of Mind. Now with us, we give you the option to nominate up five beneficiaries to receive this benefit amount. So did you happen to know who you would be nominating for your beneficiaries? Your husband.

Now in terms of applying to give you a quick overview, we like to keep everything nice and simple here at one Choice. So everything is done over the phone for you guys. There's no forms you to fill in, no medical checks you to complete, no blood tests for you to do.
[3 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : We simply take you through our health and lifestyle questions and then that would determine the final pricing in the terms of the policy for you. OK, So what we'll do is I'll get you some indicative quotes to begin with.

[15 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[15 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : And even if it's just an indicative quote and in order for me to create the profile, I will have to come and speak to him as well just to get his details from himself. So I could definitely do that. I could definitely do that for the both of you, which I will do later down the track for sure for him.
