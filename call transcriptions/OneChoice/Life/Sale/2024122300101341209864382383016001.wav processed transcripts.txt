So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay out the $600,000 to you in full. That way you can ensure you receive the best care possible there for yourself. OK, now, now with this as well, we still do have the option for you where your beneficiaries will still be able to request a funeral advance payer of $10,000 at the time of passing as well. OK, just for those immediate expenses. OK, alrighty, beautiful. Now if you are liking the sounds of everything and we can confirm that the fortnightly, sorry, the monthly premium of $63.58 per month is affordable there for you.
[24 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK. Sounds good.
[25 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, wonderful. So what we'll do is we'll get you immediately covered over the phone today and what I'll do is I'll send you all the policy documents for you to review. Now with this, we do offer you a 30 day cooling off. So if you decide this policy is not suitable for you and cancel within the 30 days, then you will receive a full refund of your premium unless the claim has been made.
[25 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[25 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, beautiful. Now please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year. Now in addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by five years, sorry, by 5% with associated increases in premium. So you can opt out of this indexation each year, OK, So you have that option there available for you as well.
[26 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : That's OK. So that means that hold on, on the indexation question. So that means that the monthly premium will also increase, but I have an option to opt out if I don't want to do increase, right?
[26 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK, alrighty, OK, no, so, so the monthly premium is stepped, which means your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year, but in terms of the indexation which will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. So you can opt out of the indexation each year, but your premium it is step. So we'll still generally increase each year.
[26 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : So roughly, but how much does the premium increase each year with you, with you now?
[26 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK. That is a good question. So I can give you some indicative projections. So this isn't 110%. Once again, it's just an indicative premium projection.
[27 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[27 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So let's just say one year from now as the policy owner is right now you're 38 as you're 39. So a year from now, the total monthly premium would be $69.42 per month.
[27 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[27 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK. And yeah, that's just some projection there for you, OK, For the following year.
[27 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[27 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Alrighty, alrighty. So what we'll do is we'll grab a few more details off you here. So I will just confirm the address. So could I please one second here, Sorry. OK, alright, so just give me one second here. I'm just gonna pop everything in order there for you, OK?
[28 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Alright, alright.
[28 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Alright, just give me one second here. Alrighty, wonderful. So now that's come up there. OK, beautiful. So I've got everything in order there. And just to recap with you as well, we did look at the $600,000 for $63.58 per month there. Now the next step here, Nova is dependent on you. So we actually have to get you to choose a day where you would want your first payment to get taken out. So we give you that flexibility here. So you're not required to make any payments today. So what day would suit you best there for your first payment there? The 30th of this month. OK, no worries. Let me pop that in.
[30 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : I would say the 30th of this month, yeah, no, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. We are going to have that 30 days from now, right?
[30 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So the 30th, What was that? Sorry.
[30 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : So now, so are we. Do I have the option to give like 30 days before I start game?
[30 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : No, no. So how it works is you have a 30 day cooling off. That starts from the day you start your first payment.
[31 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[31 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So when you start your FIR you'll be covered immediately by the day you start your first payment. From then on you have a 30 day cooling off. And then if you cancel within the 30 days, then you receive a full refund of your premiums.
[31 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, OK. Makes sense.
[31 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yes. But if you want to, you do, you can stretch out your first payment to whatever suits you best. So if you want to do it this month, you can do it this month. If you want to do it early next month, you can do it early next month as well. So what day suits you best, Sir?
[31 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Is it possible to do it on the 20th of next month? Yep.
[31 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : On the 20th of next month, it could potentially be. Let me have a look. Yeah. So I can pop your first collection date as the 20th of January 2025, and then it'll be every month on the 20th from then on.
