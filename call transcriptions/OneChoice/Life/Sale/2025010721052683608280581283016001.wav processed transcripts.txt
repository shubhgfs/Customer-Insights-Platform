Be more than happy to take you through. Yeah, perfect. So we'll go over to funeral now. OK. So just so I do have a good understanding for this quote as well for Fowler, are you new to funeral cover or do you currently have some kind of cover in place?
[24 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please no.
[25 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Well, what I'll do is I'll explain the main features and benefits of our policy. I'll run through some pricing with you. The other thing I'll be here to do is and any questions, OK. So if you do have any questions, please do not hesitate, be more than happy to answer them. So with our funeral cover, it provides a cash benefit of up to $30,000. And really what it's designed to do for you for follow is provide you Peace of Mind that you would know in the event of you passing away, we would pay that money directly to your loved ones. Now that money can be used for not only for the funeral expenses but any other final expenses such as unpaid bills as well. OK.
[25 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : None.
[25 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Now you mentioned on the first call that for the life insurance, your children's father would be the beneficiaries, is that correct?
[25 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep.
[25 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : He also be the beneficiary for the for the funeral insurance?
[25 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep.
[25 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah. So as soon as one choice does send that money out for the funeral insurance, that's as far as we look into it. OK. So if your children's father did pay for the funeral and they did have any money leftover and certainly do with that what they please. Now without funeral insurance, you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the benefit amount. So same like the life insurance, you do have the option of up to five. You don't have to use all 5, but you certainly have the option. And included in our funeral insurance, we do have an accidental death triple benefit. Now what that means here is if during the claims process that comes out that unfortunately for fall, you passed away due to the direct result of an accident, what we do for you at that point is we actually triple your benefit amount. So let's just say for example, you went for $20,000 worth of funeral cover. That $20,000 would automatically become 60,000 and we still send directly to your chosen beneficiaries.
[26 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : None.
[26 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : We don't send out to any banks or any lawyers, nothing like that about now. In terms of the application process for the funeral, insurance is much simpler than the life insurance. There are no medical checks at all. We don't expect you to fill any forms in, go to any doctor's appointments, do any blood tests. There are actually no questions that I would need to take you through at all. It's because we actually guarantee acceptance based on a couple conditions. So you do have to be a New Zealand resident currently residing in New Zealand. You do have to be aged between 18 and 79. Now I'll let you know that the accidental death triple benefit, we also have an accidental series injury triple benefit as well.
[27 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : None.
[27 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So if you were to suffer an accidental serious injuries such as quadriplegia or paraplegia before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, then the benefit amount will also triple. So the accidental death triple benefit as well as the accidental serious injury triple benefits. So 2 separate scenarios in the policy where the benefit amount can triple. Now for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause.
[28 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : None.
[28 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with the terminal illness for 12 months or less to lead by medical practitioner, we pay that the set amount to you in full. OK. So, so in terms of the pricing here, so you can choose between $3000, sorry, not pricing in terms of the level of cover, you can choose between $3000 up to 30,000. It does go up in denominations of $1000 for four. So it goes 3004 thousand, 5006 thousand all the way up to 30,000.
[28 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : What's the 20,000?
[28 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : What benefit would you like a quote on 20,000? Yeah, no worries. So for the benefit amount of $20,000 of funeral cover, you are looking at a fortnightly premium of $45.37. How does that sound in terms of suitability?
[29 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Would you be able to just send me the quote with my papers and I'll just have a look at it if it's alright?
[29 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, of course, of course, absolutely.
[29 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[29 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Now, just before I do get that one sent off to you for follow up, I will let you know in terms of your premiums for the funeral insurance, your premiums are level. So they're actually designed to stay consistent year on year instead of increasing as you age. And then when you do reach the age of 85, so I can see here a long way off, still got plenty of birthdays to celebrate before you reach that milestone. But when you do reach that age of 85 for fall, the first thing that happens straight away is your premiums will cease. So we don't actually expect you to put a single cent more towards that policy when you reach the age of 85. And we still keep that policy in place for you, we'll actually add a 25% bonus cover automatically to that benefit amount. So if you did go for the $20,000 worth of cover, when you do reach the age of 85, you stop paying for the policy at all. That $20,000 becomes $25,000 and that anytime after your 85th birthday you will have an early cash out option become available to you. Now what that means is you can choose to end your cover and we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit.
[29 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[30 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, now I'll get that one emailed out to you as well. But just before I do e-mail it out, I just want to make sure that this policy does sound good for you. So the benefit amount of $20,000, would that be enough to cover your funeral?
