[1 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Just a typical toddler.
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that's understandable. I actually don't have any kids for myself and we're the same age. But hopefully one day I do have a boy just like Yous or Chestnut, because I've always wanted all boys. So fingers crossed by myself there.

[1 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So was. Yeah. What was that?
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Oh, you do? I don't. You don't want any girls.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : No, for some reason, I've always, I've always been a bit more interested in boys for some reason.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes][Agent] : But they would you tell me that girls are much harder than boys. But from your experience so far, is it easy taking care of a boy?
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Oh.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : He's actually quite easy going compared to my cousins who have a girl.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that's nice to hear.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : So boys are easier than girls.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, I've always wanted all boys, but other than that, a as long as my chapter, my child, my future child's healthy and happy, then it's perfectly fine. I couldn't complain. But other than that, there's just now, was this to cover like a mortgage or is it just a bit of financial security for your lovely son?
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yes that's fine just for security.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : For security, Yeah. So that's exactly what our life insurance is designed to do. Now, I understand that Nikita was going through a quilt with yourself there. So just to begin with, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : No I don't smoke at all.
[2 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : That's perfectly fine. I'm really glad you don't because I don't either. And it's such a a good healthy lifestyle choice as well.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : It is.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So and also is your current annual income $50,000 or more?
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : I currently don't work at the moment so I just stay at home and look after my son full time.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : That is perfectly fine. So are you receiving any type of benefit for your subscription? OK.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I am below.
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : And so would you say would that benefit be more than $50,000 or just below that below? That's perfectly fine. Then I'll put no for that question there. So understanding that you don't work Sheshna, but you do have that source of income, which is the benefit, Is it perfect? So you can choose cover between $100,000 and order up to a maximum of $1 million. What amount would you like me to quote you on 1st day, Sheshna?
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I'm actually not so sure myself.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. So, so for example, do you know perhaps maybe how much you want to leave behind to your son? So we can get anywhere in between, in between by $50,000 increment. So would you like me to start off at $100,000? Then we can work our way up to find something that does fit into the budget. Perfect. No worries. So, so Shana, if we were to start off with $100,000 of live cover, you are looking into getive payment of $3.20 a fortnight.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, uh huh.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So that's roughly around $1.60 a week. How does that one sound there?
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, No, it sounds good. Yeah.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : No worries. So did you want me to work our way, way up by $50,000 increments or are you happy to stick with that $100,000 just for now?
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : If I do $500,000, how much would it be just in the middle?
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Of of course, we can definitely look at that 500,000, of course, yeah. So for $500,000, it would be $15.99 a fortnight.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's good.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : How does that one sound now, Seschner OK, no worries. I'm really glad we're able to find the right level of cover for yourself. So say for example, sessional or for example, in the future if you do resume work for yourself or perhaps in the future if you change your mind you just wanted a bit more cover or you wanted lower cover. You can actually just call us back and apply subject to eligibility at the time of application to increase that or decrease that, that level of cover with our support team.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Now sessional you also have the option to add in extra benefits with your life insurance. So these optional covers are the serious illness cover and the total and and permanent disability cover. So it's really entirely up to you if you want to add it in or not. So for a serious illness cover, the insured events are heart attack, cancer, stroke or coronary bypass surgery. So each of these events are defined within the policy and each claim is assessed against these definitions.
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So you can apply from $50,000 up to the less of $500,000 or 50% of your chosen life insurance benefit. So just to give you an idea there sessional for $50,000 of serious illness cover you will be paying $2.50 a fortnight on top of your life insurance premium. So your total premium with the life insurance and the serious illness cover it would be $18.49 a fortnight.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : I think so, but is there is there an option where I can think about it and then later edit later on? Yeah. Uh huh.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So does this sound something like the optional cover sounds something like you wanted to add with your life insurance decisional of of course, that's perfectly fine session now to say for example, for both of these optional covers, say for example, if you just decide to proceed with the life insurance only today, you can always call us back and apply subject to eligibility at the time application to have those options have it added on.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : If you do change your mind, OK, perfect. No worries. So, so Chanel, I'll just leave it just for life insurance only there. So the next step is to go through the health and lifestyle questions as this will determine the pricing in terms of the policy.
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, uh huh.
