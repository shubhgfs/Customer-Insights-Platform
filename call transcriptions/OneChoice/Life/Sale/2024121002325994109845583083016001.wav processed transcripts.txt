[3 seconds][Agent] : Hi, Anna. It's Christina calling back from Montrose Insurance. How are you?
[8 seconds][Customer] : I'm good. Thank you.
[9 seconds][Agent] : That's good to hear. I was giving you a call back today about our conversation that we're having a couple of weeks ago about some life insurance for yourself. And I was, yeah, I was calling back today to be able to go through that with you. So I can do that for you. Can I please get you to confirm your full name and date of birth?
[19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm the man of 18/6/1970.
[33 seconds][Agent] : Thanks. And can I confirm that you are still currently residing in New Zealand? Thank you.
[39 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yes, Yeah, I'm citizen.
[41 seconds][Agent] : Thanks, IC. Sorry, what was that?
[41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm citizen.
[47 seconds][Agent] : Yes, but you are still currently residing or living in New Zealand, is that right?
[51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[51 seconds][Agent] : OK, great. I'll let you know that all calls are recorded. Any advice to provide is limited to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they're suitable for your needs which not transfer your personal circumstances. So we were talking about the last insurance. Now, I went through a couple of quotes with you and you mentioned to me, Anna, that you were looking at the life insurance because you do have six children, 8 grandkids, and you're thinking about the future and just being able to leave some money behind for them if anything happens to you. We looked at 400,000 was the cover and then we also had a look at 350,000 and 300,000. I don't think we actually got to those the other quotes, so I'm just going to bring them up now and remind you of the cost. OK, great. So just, uh, in regards to your smoking status, have you had a secret in the last 12 months?
[1 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, thank you. So initially we looked at the 400,000 and that was a fortnightly premium of 80. Sorry, $400,000 is a fortnightly premium of $76.65.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : How much is that one?
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : And then you wanted the quote on the 350,000 which is $67.74 per fortnight, $67.74 per fortnight. And the next one that you wanted to look at was 300,000 and that's a fortnightly premium of $58.83. OK, So out of the the 300,000 and three 50,000, so any of those amounts suit you.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : I think the and and once you once you decided they don't wanna go up if you know in the future, you know, like if if I say like 3 Hun 300,000 and then later on like in a couple of years time and if I decided to change it to 400, that can be possible or no.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So you can, you can contact us and apply to increase the level of cover up until the age of 70 years old. It is subject to eligibility at that time.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : OK, I see.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So we'll go through those questions with you again, OK. But at the moment with like you know, your budget and affordability is 300,000 more suitable? Is that more within your budget? OK. Well, we can keep it there at 300,000 and then if things change, you just give us a call in the future.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK, great. So what I'll do then now for you is, I'm not sure if you remember, but when we spoke a couple of weeks ago, I mentioned to you that with the life and trying to go through some questions about your health and your lifestyle, which then confirms the final price and the terms of the policy. OK. So I'm going to bring up those questions now with you.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK.
