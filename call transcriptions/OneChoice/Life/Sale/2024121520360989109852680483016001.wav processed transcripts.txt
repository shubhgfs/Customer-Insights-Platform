[2 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Thank you so much for that as well. Alrighty, so let's pop this open here now just so I have a bit more of a better understanding there as well. Are you quite new to life insurance or do you currently have some cover and place there? Oh, OK, OK, good.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : I used to have life insurance reviews and then I let it lapse like I was paying it for like a couple of years and then I let it back because I didn't realize it was not getting paid. And then yet it same.
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : And then did it end up against yourself? Oh, OK, no. So if you don't mind me asking, how long ago was that coverage there?
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : So is there a way where I can start up again a couple of years?
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Couple of years, yeah. So with us now, we would have to go through all the health and lifestyle questions again and we would have to treat it like a new cover just because it has been a couple of years since our last cover ended then. So what I would love to do, because you have already been with us, I'll just quickly recap over all the main features and benefits. Hopefully re gob your memory a little bit there and then we'll go through those health and lifestyle questions and we'll see what we can offer you.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, OK.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK alrighty, so let's pop this open here. So just a quick recap there. What our life interest is designed to do is provide you with that financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. So with this money, this benefits, sorry, it could be used to either maintain their lifestyle, either pay off mortgage loans or any other costs involving in raising a family. So basically it's just there to give you that Peace of Mind that something was to happen to you. Your only would have that financial security there for themselves. But with the life insurance day, if you don't mind me asking, just for a better understanding, who do you plan to leave the money behind to to your nephew? And when you leave the money by my.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : To my nephew, yeah, It's like my son. I like raise them.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK. So like, you're fairly close to you guys, are you?

[4 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK. You.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : He was.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, I completely understand. Well, very similar thing happened in my culture as well.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : My older sister was actually raised by my auntie, so she calls my oldest sister her daughter instead of Miss Miss.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, same.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So I do completely understand where you're coming from there. Now with that as well, when you do leave that money behind to your nephew, are you leaving the money behind for him to do something with it or is it just for his financial security? Or do you do you like let him know that you wanna pay off a mortgage potentially or he loans or anything like that? Yes, the financials.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : It's just his financial security I never looked after.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful, wonderful. So with that as well with us you can nominate up to five beneficiaries there.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : It'll yeah, it'll be two of them. It'll be two.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So in your case, if you just want to nominate your nephew, you can nominate just him and just two of them. Yeah, beautiful. So with us you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this benefit amount and you can split it whichever way you would like.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So if you would like 6050 you could do that or 6040, it's completely up to you. And then and with that as well, at the time of passing, when you do pass away, they can also your beneficiary can also request an advanced payout of 10,000 to help with those funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time of death there for you as well.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK, repeat that.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, just to help tho, just to help your beneficiary out a little bit as well.

It's just our terminally ill advanced payment. Now, of course such would this doesn't happen, but if you there is a terminally ill advanced payment as well. So if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, I do believe we pay out the benefit amount to you. But I I will go through over sorry, I will go over all of that later on as well there for you. So what we'll do now is in terms of applying to let you know, it is all done over the phone. So we like to keep it nice and simple to you guys. There's no forms to fill in, no medical checks or blood tests.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : It's just simply those health and last hour questions that we take you through and then that will determine the pricing in the terms of the policy.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what we'll do first is I'll get you an indicative quote, like a rough idea. So to begin with, just to key yes or no, please. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? No, beautiful. Have you always not smoked or just like a bit more recent?

[6 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Not sure how you did it.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : I used to vape. I used to vape for honestly, I would stop smoking. I wouldn't have a cigarette until after 11:00. That was my starter. And then I would make it later and later and later during the day.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, so you said like you wouldn't have this to get to 11:00 AM and then slowly start like pushing it later and later in the day to stop.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yeah, later and later. And then I'd lift up to like, Oh yeah, I'd have done it in my last degree, right. And then same the next day, the next day, just make it later, later.
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Oh, wow.
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : And that worked for me. Yeah.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's the if you don't mind me asking.
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : It's like I I wouldn't have to figure it unless I earn it type thing.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK. And then if you don't mind me asking, how long did that take you to like, let go of it to have it 2 1/2 miles? That's that bad at all? OK.
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : 2 1/2 months, yeah, I, yeah, I tried to, took cold Turkey and it didn't work. And then I tried that way. And then I found that that works for me.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Oh, wonderful. Yeah, yeah. No, that's it.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Just like pushing the cigarette to like when you really deserve it, like, and then sometimes I forget that I even had to have that cigarette. And then so it'll be a couple of days and then, Oh yeah, I'll try a cigarette.
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : It's all good.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : But to be honest, it's the first week you can get over that first week, two weeks, first three weeks, that's all good because it's the two weeks that it's your craving.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So that's all I've been trying to do. I've been trying to get cold Turkey and I just find it so hard after the second day, I feel like I'm losing my mind. I'll definitely try your technique. That sounds like a good technique. I'm sure that would work for me as well. That's a good one.
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, and and and honestly, the two weeks after that, two weeks you don't even crave, but the craving makes you gotta get over.
[8 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, definitely. Well, look, thank you for the tips there. That's actually a really good idea.
