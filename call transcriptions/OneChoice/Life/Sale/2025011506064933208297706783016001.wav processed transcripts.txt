[7 minutes][Customer] : Oh, no, no, sorry.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, That's all right, All righty. So that's processing that. OK, sorry it's taking a while to load. OK, gone through now. OK, awesome. So, yeah, you'll get your policy document shortly. Have a good read through it, make sure you're happy. Umm, if you have any questions, you can give us a call. But actually, while I have you here as well, umm, that's your life insurance sorted. Do you have funeral insurance in place?
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Do I have what? Yes, I do, Yeah.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Uh, funeral insurance You do? OK, they're all good.
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : That's good that you have it. Then I'm just going to offer to go through a quote. Would you be interested in getting a quote with our cover casino?
[7 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Oh, wouldn't it?
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's have a look. So it's the same content. I guess it's similar. It's designed for the same reasons, you know, just to keep you that Peace of Mind. If something was to happen to you, then your family would get that money. You can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the benefit amount.
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Uh, you can choose anywhere from $3000 up to $30,000 will cover umm, And then there's actually a couple of ways where we would be able to triple your benefit amount. So if that was due to an accident, your choice and benefit will triple and for the living benefit too. So if you would have suffer an accidental serious injury such as quadriplegia or paraplegia before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, then the benefit amount will also triple. OK. So yeah, obviously hoping you don't have to ever claim in any of that. That's just, you know, worst case situations. Now with this one, there's no medical checks and acceptance is guaranteed. And then for the 1st 12 months, you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. And then after the first 12 months, you will be covered for death due to any cause. OK.
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[9 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : And then in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by medical practitioner, then we pay the benefit amount to you in full again, just really there is worst case scenario. So hopefully that doesn't happen. Now, is there a certain amount that you'd like to look at being covered for for the funeral insurance?
[9 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Not sure what a funeral cost is these days.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : That's OK.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : We'd probably want food.
[9 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : We can have a look for you. Look at it depends on the type of funeral you wish to have. I mean, research has shown that the average cost of a standard burial funeral service in New Zealand is $11,000, while the average cost of standard cremation in New Zealand is $7500.
[9 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Oh OK.
[9 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[10 minutes][Customer] : No, probably. Yeah. 2020 grand, I suppose.
[10 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So, yeah, we can go through a few different amounts just to give you a rough idea. But yeah, look, I'll start at $20,000 for you. And then with the funeral insurance, your premium is level, which means they're designed to stay consistent. You're on. Yeah. And then, Henry, when you've reached the age of 85, your premiums will stay. So you'll actually stop paying premiums all together at that point?
[10 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[10 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And you'll also get a 25% bonus cover automatically be added to your benefit about when you're age 85. You have another option there because anytime after your 85th birthday, you can end your cover if you'd like. So you can choose to end your cover and then we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. So if you. Yeah, if you needed any immediate money at that time, OK. But if we look at $20,000 of cover, the accidental serious injury component would triple to $60,000 and you'd be looking at $53.17 a fortnight and that's $26.58 give or take a week.
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : How does that sound? Yeah, Yeah.
[11 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it sounds alright, but I'll just, I'll just go with the other one, the one I've got already, Yeah.
[11 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Just the the life insurance, Yeah, Yeah, that's OK. Well, yeah, you've got that ready to borrow. If you don't mind me asking, just with your funeral insurance that you already have in place, do you have $20,000 there as well?
[11 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, the other one's, I think it's 30.
[11 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : 30, OK.
[11 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[11 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And is it working out to be cheaper or is it more expensive?
[11 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : And it's probably about a couple of dollars a year.
[11 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : They're all OK. Yeah, OK.
[11 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yes, more expensive, but yeah, that's right.
[11 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, you wouldn't be interested in in, you know, having it all under the same roof, I guess, or what? What? One choice.
[12 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. I don't know. No, I'll just, I'll just stay with, stay with you before.
[12 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, that's OK. It's something for you to think about anyway. But yeah, your life insurance is good to go. And if you change your mind about the funeral, feel free to give us a call back. And we also do income protection if you're interested in that later down the track.
[12 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, alright. It's kind of weird just talking about.
[12 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Alrighty, I know it's not something that we talk about every day. Umm, yeah. But look, you're, you're still very young. Umm, you have plenty of years to live. It's just, you know, something that we do put on the back burner like it's not going to happen anytime soon, but well, hopefully it doesn't it of course, but yeah, you just let them know.
[12 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, it's wrong.
[12 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Alright. OK. Well, well, thank you so much for your time today. Enjoy the rest of your night. And yeah, like I said, feel free to give us a call if you do have any questions or change of heart.
[13 minutes][Customer] : Yep. No worries.
