[15 minutes][Customer] : Yes.
[15 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And would you like any other information now or would you like me to read any part of the policy document to you, Yes or no? No, Beautiful. I'm going to go through and accept that one there for yourself. Bear with me. That one is just loading while you still are here on the phone with me today there. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
[15 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I don't do that.
[15 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : No, beautiful, not a worry, I will look. I can also let you know as well. We do have a funeral insurance policy here at One Choice. If you're interested in wanting to have a look into our funeral insurance here, I can look at some information and pricing for yourself.
[15 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll look at it myself.
[15 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yep, beautiful, not a worry at all. We'll look in regards to our funeral insurance. The way that this one works here for yourself is that with this one here, it provides a cash benefit of up to $30,000. So of course, with this one, what it's designed to do is provide you that Peace of Mind that if you were to pass away, we would pay that money to your loved ones to help not only for things like funeral expenses, but any other final expenses such as unpaid bills there. Now with this one as well with this policy, you can also as well nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this benefit amount there for yourself. Uh, in regards to that one. Now I know that you did mention that you do have two beautiful kids, so you can certainly pop them both down as the beneficiaries for the funeral insurance as well, to leave the money behind to them. But for yourself here as well. I will let you know there is going to be two instances where your chosen benefit amount is going to triple. And this is in the event, Touchwood, that your death was due to an accident. So that's the first instance. So say we look at $10,000 worth of funeral cover here today. In the event that you passed away due to an accident, we would actually pay the benefit amount out to your beneficiaries as triple the benefit amount. So $30,000 out of a lump sum.
[16 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : And.
[17 minutes][Agent] : And now the second instance for yourself is if you were to suffer an accidental serious injuries such as quadraplegia or paraplegia before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, then the benefit amount will also triple in this instance for yourself. Now for yourself here was, well, I will let you know for the 1st 12 months, you will be covered to accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months, you will be covered for death due to any cause. So whether it be of a natural cause or an accident, you are going to be completely covered there.
[17 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[17 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : And now in addition as well, uh, this is, there is a terminal illness benefit. Uh, which what that means there for yourself is that after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we would actually pay the benefit amount out to yourself in full. That's what we like to call our living benefit here at One Choice. So with that money there for yourself, you can actually deal with what you see fit with the money. So whether it be to go on one last holiday or ticket for bucket with bucket list with your children, or even if you just want to get yourself the best care possible at that time, the choice would be entirely up to yourself. And we're not gonna tell you how to spend a single cent of that money. Now, just keep in mind here for yourself, the minimum benefit amount we can look at is $3000, up to the maximum benefit amount of $30,000. Now, of course, we can bring this one up or down to sue any needs or budgets you may have in place there. Now, do you know what benefit in that you'd like me to quote you on 1st?
[18 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : I think for now with funeral insurance, we can just wait. Yeah, I know.
[18 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[18 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : We can just wait for it at the moment.
[18 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Look, and that's not a worry.
[18 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's what that is.
[18 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, beautiful. And look, that's still no worry at all there in regards to that one. Look, if anything does change there, you're wanting to look back into some funeral insurance there, Please feel free to give us a call at any time there. We'd be more than happy to assist you further in regards to that one.
[19 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[19 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : But the last one is all done and set for yourself there. But is there anything else I can assist you with further today while you're still on the phone here? No.
