Nice and quick and easy. Let's have a look at the results for you here. OK, so the results have come back immediately. Great news for yourself. You have been approved for the life insurance policy, Jonathan. Jonathan, so big congratulations to you. OK, no problem. Now I want to let you know and explain in regards to, umm, the outcome here. Now you mentioned hepatitis, so I just want to make it nice and clear for you. So for the hepatitis, you have that Peace of Mind that that is covered, OK? So we've captured that in the application and you have that support with us for the hepatitis.
[11 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep, OK.
[11 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, Just so you're aware now it goes through the benefits for you here and explain how that works. Umm, so you have the understanding of how it supports, as you mentioned, your kids. Now, please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it'll generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 2%, associated increases in premium. You can of course opt out of this indexation each year now. The first benefit included for yourself here Jonathan, is the support for death. How this works is for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death. Only. After 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause. However, suicide is not covered in the 1st 13 months of the policy. So providing for you that support for death that'll be paid up in short amount in full and your beneficiary, your kids can receive that full lump sum. OK, now what we also provide you with here is a living benefit. OK, so that works here is it's umm, a terminally in advanced payment, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you are first, so if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less delivered by a medical practitioner, we can pay your claim out in full. So with this benefit, Jonathan, you can receive the money yourself whilst alive that can be paid out in full. You can even use that money to support medical expenses, treatment costs, OK? That way you don't have to use your own money.
[11 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : If let's say you use the money towards medical expenses or treatment and you get better or you live longer than the 12 months, you get to keep that money in full. You don't have to pay anything back. OK, so that's for the term of your list. And then lastly, what we provide here is a, umm, funeral benefit. So when you pass away, your kids can request an advance payout of $10,000 to help with any funeral costs. So those three benefits, Jonathan, is all included in the cover. Does that all make sense?
[13 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[13 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yep, fantastic. Now like I mentioned, you had the great news that the application for the life insurance has been approved subject to the following terms and conditions. So we are able to offer you a benefit amount of $50,000 to $100,000 with a policy term of 20 years. So there has been a change, Jonathan, in the level of cover and premium. The reason for the change is based on the hepatitis, OK. But like I mentioned earlier, the hepatitis has not been excluded. You are still covered for that, just so you're aware. OK. So the maximum we can offer for you now is a cover of 100,000. So that's providing you with the three benefits still all included and that's a premium of $56.47 per fortnight. Are you still comfortable with that, Jonathan? So all up it's $56.47 per fortnight.
[14 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : So that's all I thought now, yes.
[14 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Now what was that order? So we can go ahead now and get that organized for you.
