[3 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : What's the other one?
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : We've got a life insurance and a fuel insurance for the both available with the life Insu fuel insurance. So although it is, yeah, it's from 3000 up to $30,000 a cover, but it's guaranteed. So there's no medical checks, blood tests, or health questions at all?

[3 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK With our life insurance, umm, that is from $100,000 up to $500,000. And that one we will take you through health and livestock questions for. OK, so I can see here you put a request through for $300,000. Is that what you were looking at?
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. I thought, well that that would obviously help my family live comfortably if I depart.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : And I guess it would be the same with my husband who we do have our own, so we own our house, but still, you know, the mortgage is still there.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : And then, but do you have, like you said, you've mentioned two different policies, but do you have one that includes both?
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : So with our life insurance, it does also allow for your beneficiaries to request an advanced payout of $10,000 to help with any fuel expenses, which is generally paid within one business day of receiving the completed documentation. So it is that quick financial help that you're looking for as well.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, that's fine.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, now let's have a look at some pricing for you there. Rose, Firstly, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?

[5 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : No Beautiful. OK, And you can choose from, as I said, 100 up to $500,000, but we'll look at the 300 for you. Let me just $1000 for yourself there. Rose It would be a fortnightly premium as $160.25 a fortnight.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK, come again. How much that would that be?
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : How does that one sound for you there, $160.25 per fortnight?

[5 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Now do you have a? Yeah.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So it is based on your age, yeah. No.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Do you have a package for family like for?
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So it would be a 2 separate policies, one for yourself and one for your husband.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : We don't offer a joint one partly because there is two different ways our life insurance can take depending on your response to the health and livestock questions. OK.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK. So can you give me a figure for for a quote for two 200?
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Absolutely. If we're looking at the $200,000, it's 200. And sorry, $110.17 per fortnight. Yeah.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : That sounds a bit doable but then I I need to look at. So what about for my husband? Can you give me a quote for his mom?
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : How old is your husband? How old is your husband?
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, 53.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, so he will be, he will likely be, uh, cheaper than yourself just based on age. He'll be a little more based on his, uh, B more would be at that same, a same age. Umm, is he a smoker or a nonsmoker?
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, non smaker.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Nonsmoker. Yeah. So taking all that into consideration, he would, uh, likely be cheaper than what you are.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK. Can you give me a quote for that?
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, I can. But before I do that because I'll need to open up a view profile, what I'll do is take you through the health and lifestyle questions. That way we can make sure that pricing is accurate and that you're eligible for the cover.

[10 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I have. I have no idea what you're asking now.
[10 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, let me just bring up my definitions for pericarditis so I can get that for you. Won't be 1 moment. Sorry, my system's going slow. There you go. I think it's too tired for a Monday morning. OK, so pericarditis, oh, it's inflammation, swelling and irritation of the thin satellite membrane surrounding the heart or the pericardium. So this is asking if the condition you had is peri, is it pericarditis?
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : I, I really don't want to say this or no because I'm not, still not sure.
[11 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, was it? So you said it was angina? OK, Yeah. Yeah, I understand.
[11 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Well, it kind of affected my heart, which caused, you know, a few heart complications, but it was an influx of, of fluid which was drowning my heart out. And so I was taken in and it affected like the oxy oxygen level, my breathing and my, it did kind of affected my heart at that time because of, because of the fluid buildup.
[11 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm, hmm.
[11 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : And then they were able, once they were able to train with it, it says fluid out went back to normal.
[12 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : I understand exactly.
[12 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : So I have no idea whether that whether that's related because I mean, but but concerned about answering yes or no.
[12 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, let me slip.
[12 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : And and you know, and, and it's simply because I don't, I'm, I don't wanna be national state due to misunderstanding.
[12 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[12 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : I will just say yes, but it may not be. Does that make sense?
[12 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, So yeah, So based on what you've told me in the definition of pericarditis, I'm confident that we can answer no to that one.
[12 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK. Thank you.
[12 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, Alright. Now it says do you have any other heart conditions? So I'll answer yes to that one.
[12 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[12 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK. Because it was the the strain on the heart due to the fluid.
[12 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yes.

[13 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, certainly.
[13 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Does that make sense? Yeah.

[14 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[14 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yes.

[14 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[14 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, now it then asks is it heart palpitations?
[14 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Can I explain that, please?
[14 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So heart palpitations is when your heartbeat you can, it feels like it's racing in in your chest. Let me get the actual definition. So it's palpitations, generally a feeling of the heart beating too hard or too fast, skipping a beat or fluttering. Heart palpitations may be noticed in the chest, throat or neck. They can be caused by stress and anxiety, too much caffeine, nicotine or alcohol. They can occur during pregnancy. In some cases, palpitations can be a sign of a more serious heart condition.
[15 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK. I have to say yes for that because when I was in hospital that, yeah, I did have episodes of my heart racing.
[15 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[15 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[15 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, alright. And then it asks have you fully recovered from all your symptoms for the last 12 months?
[15 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : I have fully recovered, but I'm on the medication and I think that's what's helped me. But yeah, totally.
[15 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[15 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : I don't have that problem anymore. Yeah. No, no, I don't have that.
[15 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, So with the heart palpitations and the, the trouble with the heart. OK.
[15 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : And that was only when I was in hospital.
[15 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : All right, So I'll answer yes to that one because you have fully recovered from all your heart symptoms for at least 12 months.
[15 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[15 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK. Yeah. And it's good to see that you, the, the fluids are helping to keep that under control. It's a horrible feeling when that builds up, isn't it?
[16 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes. The only problem is having to go to the bathroom just about every.
[16 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yes.
[16 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : It does disrupt your normal, you know, daily routine If you, you know, if you. But yeah, it has to be done. It has to be done.
[16 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's exactly right.
[16 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : And you notice the difference because then I end up having swollen ankles and so forth. It means that I have not taken the tablet. Yeah.
[16 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. Yes. Alright, now it says, were your palpitations due to a heart condition?
[16 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : So, yeah, well, not sure if it was a heart condition.
[16 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : The fluid putting the pressure.
[16 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : It was a result of this fluid buildup and I guess it also related to stress. I did have a very stressful job and and lifestyle and I think that was part of the buildup too.
[16 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, yeah, OK. Right, right. So you went looking after yourself properly.
[17 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I am.
[17 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Typical woman.
[17 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[17 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, We look after everyone else before we get to ourselves.
[17 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Except yourself. Yes.
[17 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yes. All right.
[17 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's absolutely right.
[17 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK. So there wasn't actually a condition on your with your heart. It was more of a a pressure on the heart. Is that correct?
[17 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK. All right. Now they, they said that the heart itself was fine, that there was no issues with the heart function or anything like that.
[17 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
[17 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[17 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : And every time I go in for a regular check, the heart, blood pressure, everything is all fine. Everything's just gone back to normal. Probably even better than what it needs to be.

And because you were going through all of that, you would have been stressing about that as well, wouldn't you? On top of everything with work and life.

[28 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[28 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yep. All right, let me just capture that for us. Won't be 1 moment. Alright Rose, can you just give me one moment there while that is, uh, being processed? I'll be back with you shortly.
[29 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK. Thank you.
[29 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Thank you so much for holding there Rose.
[31 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : It's fine.
[31 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : It's a pre appreciated. All right, so that is all the questions I need to take you through at this point in time. Now congratulations, your application has been approved now due to the type 2 diabetes. Umm, it is, even though I know it's well controlled and you're not on a medication or anything, you have been diagnosed with it.
[31 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : MMM mm. Hmm.
[32 minutes][Agent] : So because of that, it is subject to the following terms and conditions. We are able to offer you a benefit amount of $50,000 to $100,000 with a policy term of 20 years. OK, so the maximum we California can offer you is the TWE. Is it $100,000? That would be a fortnightly premium. Just waiting for that to pop up for me. Won't be 1 moment. OK. It's going really slow and I do apologise. OK. So ah, yes, So based on the disclosures we've captured up to there, $100,000 is a fortnightly premium of $123.60 a fortnight.
[32 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's more than the 110 that you gave me.
[32 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : That is correct. Yes, because that was just an indicative figure. This is taking into account specifics.
[32 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : The Fortnite for the right.
[33 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[33 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So fortnightly, what was that? What was that?
[33 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So it's $123.60 per fortnight.
[33 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : No, it's OK.
[33 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So it's taking into account BMI as well as the diabetes like the ones where we've answered yes to as well as all come into play there.
[33 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's for the cover is 100,000.
[33 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, that is for the $100,000 you can choose from 5075 or $100,000. If that's a little bit high for you we can have a look at something a little bit lower.
[33 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, it's it's fine.
[33 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[33 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : I just wanted to so I can't go higher than 100,000.
[33 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : No you can't. Umm OK Now the way the policy will work is for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death. Only after 12 months you'll be covered for death due to any cause. However suicide is not covered in the 1st 13 months of the policy.
[34 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Right, OK.
[34 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Now as well as that there is a living benefit called a terminally ill advanced payment. Now, what that means is, although it's something you have never nee never needed after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, we can pay that claim in full while you are still living, all right? So that way if something like that was to happen, you would have that financial support there.
[34 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK, right. OK.
[34 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : All right, OK.
[34 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : And yeah, no, that sounds good.
[34 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yep. It does also allow for your husband and family to request an advanced payout of $10,000 to help with any fuel expenses or other fun expenses at that time. And that, as I said, will be paid generally within one business day of receiving the completed documentation for quick help.
[35 minutes][Customer] : OK.
[35 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : All right. Now, please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means that we generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 2% with associated increases in premium. You can opt out of this indexation each year. It is something we offer you on an annual basis, so you've got that control and flexibility over your own cover.
[35 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK, so how do I get that started?
[35 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So it's nice and easy. We do that all over the phone for you today to get you covered immediately over the DA phone. You don't need to make any payments today. What we do is we enter your preferred method of payment. You can choose either a bank account or a Visa MasterCard and what day you want that pay to get payment to come out.

[37 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK, fortnightly this way.

[37 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Let me have a look.

Umm, if we have that first payment come out, umm, after your birth on or after your birthday, umm, that there is going to be a difference in pricing because you'll actually be, uh, 64 by the time the first payment comes out. OK, so if we have that first payment after you on or after your birthday, it'll actually be $133.27 at fortnight. Would you like to have it come out on the Thursday the 19th? So it is prior to your birthday and we can lock it in for that 12 months at the low at at at being 63.
