[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK, alright.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : You can select a date best suited for yourself. This way, you're actually covered while you're making your decision, and you have access to those tailored policy documents as well. Does this sound like a suitable option for yourself? Yeah.

[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So is that one sounding like a suitable option for yourself down the neck?
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : It probably is right now. Yeah, probably.
