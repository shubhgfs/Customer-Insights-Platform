[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Thank you. All right. And also, do you have an e-mail address?

[3 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : So it's Donna in for mary21@outlook.com.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : At outlook dot com. Yep, thank you. Alright, just opening up a new quote there. Have you looked into your life insurance before or do you have something in place at the moment?
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Go ahead. Something can take at the moment.
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK. So you're looking at replacing that one or are you looking at a top up cover?
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Well, looking at the PLA, maybe a replacement, we're just, yeah, just wanting to get some quotes out there.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Sure. But is that what you're aiming for, to replace it with a better one? Right.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes, yeah.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. Well, without life insurance, what it's designed to do of course, is to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you want to pass away. And this benefit could be used to help maintain their lifestyle by helping them pay off a mortgage, loans and any other costs involved in raising a family. So with the insurance that you've got in place at the moment, do you have that in place for any specific reason along those lines?
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I go.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. OK. And and what made you want to have a look at potentially changing it just out of curiosity? Too expensive.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, yeah, just the payment option just yeah, yeah, I think that's what I think so.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Right.
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So I just, yeah.
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK, fair enough. OK, well, I mean, uh, with, with that life insurance cover, you can choose up to five people to leave the money to and provided that we umm, oh, I'm sorry. What they can also do at the time of claim is, is request an advanced payout of $10,000 to help with any funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. Does your current one also offer a, an advanced payout for funeral expenses as well? Uh, not like it does.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : I think it does, yeah.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. And does it cover you for terminal illness?
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, we do have a former as well as the Lord.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Right. OK, Well, this policy automatically comes with a terminally ill advanced payment. And how it works is if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we'll pay your claim in full and the money could be used for medical costs, etcetera, to ensure that you receive the best care possible.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Uh, and we do keep everything nice and simple as well. So everything is all done over the phone. There's no forms to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete, but we simply take you through health and lifestyle questions as this will, this will determine the pricing and terms of the policy for you as well. So just a couple questions. First of all, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? No, Perfect. And I can quote you from $100,000 up to a maximum of $750,000. So how much cover did you wanna have a look at comparing with today? OK, so if it's 200 and so if it's $150,000 of life insurance cover for just yourself, it comes to an indicative payment of $59.03 a fortnight. So that's $59.03 a fortnight for the, uh, for the $250,000 of cover. How's that sounding for you?
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Right, no, we're, we're looking at 2:52 yeah, 255, yeah, Yep, right.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yep. But and is that working?
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : And that's a life insurance. And then so it has this sort of trauma and there's enough that you're saying that is it, right? Did I understand that right?
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : We've got terminal illness included in it.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : A terminal? Oh, no, that's yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the one.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's that's automatically built into the policy. Yeah.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : OK, No, OK.
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So does that work out to be a better option than what you've got currently? Like, is that worth replacing the current one with?
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. Well, we'll go through the health questions to see if there's any changes to the quote and if it still works out to be worth switching over to this one, then we'll get it all set up for you over the phone. So just before we go through the health questions, I just need to note down your home address before we get started. What was the post code that you're in? UH31 1-3? Yep, thank you.

[22 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, awesome.
[22 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK. But it's fine. Yeah. Yeah.
[22 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Uh, one thing I do need to let you know is if you are placing an existing policy, we recommend that you don't cancel it until you have reviewed this policy in full as it may not be identical to your existing cover.
[22 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[22 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : But I mean, the good news is that like the first payment isn't coming out until the 1st of July anyway. And the documentation we do send out to you today once we get the policy set up, so that way you can read over it. And yeah, so once we get the policy set up for you, you'll get all of the documentation by e-mail and post. So the e-mail copy generally takes, you know, within 15 minutes to reach you.
[22 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Oh, well, yeah, yes, right.
[22 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : And then the hard copy should generally take a a about 5 to 10 business days.

[23 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK.

[33 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[33 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yep, perfect. Thank you for that.
[33 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's fine.
[33 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : All right, and I've got, and do you want me to use the same e-mail as Donna as well, which is Donna and yeah, sure. So that's just donnam21@outlook.com.
[33 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Correct. Thank you.
[33 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yep. Thank you. That's all right. And you guys are obviously at the same address. Yeah, perfect. Thank you for that. So that's 4 Moss Crescent in Tarkanini 40. Sorry, 2112. And that's your home and postal address.
[33 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's correct.
[33 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Perfect. Thank you for that. OK, so just opening up a new quote for you there. All right, Won't be too long. OK, so I've seen that you're with the, uh, the same places done at the moment for your, for your life insurance.
[34 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : That's right.
[34 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. And does that have the same benefits as well? Like it's got the life insurance and then the also the serious illness or the trauma cover. Sorry.
[34 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[34 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, sure. Right. Well, as you might have overheard, uh, from my conversation with Donna, without life insurance, it is designed to primarily cover you when you pass away so that there's a lump sum payment I thought we make to your loved ones to help them with any, uh, well, to, to give them financial protection against any, you know, mortgages, loans or any other costs involved in, uh, maintaining their lifestyle, etcetera.
[34 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[34 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Uh, so basically, as you know, it's there to give you the Peace of Mind that if something happened to you, your family would have that financial secure security. Umm, So what we also have is a terminally ill advanced payment. This is automatically included in the cover. Uh, so how it works is that if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we'll pay your claim in full. That way you can put the money towards your treatment or any medical costs, uh, you know, to ensure that you receive the best care possible, but you could also put it towards like any loans, mortgages or debts whilst you're still alive. So it's out of the way for the family or, or, or however you wanna, you know, use that money.
[35 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[35 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Of course, umm, you can choose up to five people to leave the money to. And, uh, what they can also do at the time of claim, I is request an advanced payout of $10,000 to help with any funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. Uh, Alex, just a question. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Perfect. All right, good stuff. Apart from that question, we've got some health and lifestyle questions that we'll go through with you a bit later. As you might have heard me go through with Donna there. Uh, but we do, we do keep everything nice and simple for you as well. So everything's all done over the phone. You know, there's no forms to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete. So hopefully that might, you know, save you a trip to the doctor and, and getting a medical done and, and all that sort of stuff. Umm, so for yourself, I can quote you from $100,000 up to $500,000. Do you want to look at 2:50 as well or do you want to look at a different amount?
[35 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : No, Yes. Oh, no, 250 is fine. Thanks.
[36 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure, no worries. All right and just let me know if this does work out to be a better option than what you've got currently. So if if you look at the $250,000 of cover, uh, that, that works out to be $153.85 a fortnight. So that's 15385 a fortnight. Uh, does that work out to be a better option than what you've got currently for your insurance there, Alex? Oh, perfect. Alright, awesome. Well, we'll go through the health questions for your one as well. Do you wanna do a monthly payment as well if you go ahead?
[36 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks.
[36 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. So just letting you know, you know what that's gonna be, that's gonna be, uh, oh, all threes. It's, uh, $333.33 per month. Makes it a bit easier to remember.
[36 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I reckon.
[36 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, awesome. So we're going through the health questions with you there. I, I did read out a pre underwriting disclosure statement to Donna. I'll just read that same thing out to you as well. Uh, just so that we're transparent in our processes and, and so that you're aware of this sort of stuff before we go through the questions.
[37 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Alright, alright.
[37 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Uh, so it says, please be aware. All calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes. We collect your personal information to provide insurance quotes, issue cover and other related services. We will share this with your insurer and may share it with others and may share it with other service providers for the purpose of administering your policy or handling claims. Our privacy policy tells you more, including how to access and correct your information and lodge complaints about breach of privacy. I also need to inform you about your duty of disclosure before you enter into a life insurance contract. You have a legal duty to provide to us any information you know or could reasonably be expected to know, which may affect our decision to insure you and on what terms. You do not need to tell us things that we already know or should know as an insurer, or which reduces the risk we insure. You have this duty until the time we enter into the contracts. If you fail to disclose a matter or you make a false statement and answer to our questions, we may be able to decline a claim and place new conditions on your policy. Or avoid your policy entirely. Sorry. Or avoid your policy entirely. Do you understand this?
[38 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I do.
[38 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you for that. So a lot of these questions are gonna be yes or no. So we've tried to simplify it as best as we can. If you need me to reread anything or you know, give you the definitions for, you know, any medical conditions and stuff like that, feel free to let me know and I can definitely help you out with that. So just for the first, for the first question here, it's, it's just in regards to your residence. Uh, so it says are you a citizen or permanent resident of New Zealand or Australia? Currently residing in New Zealand, Yes or no?
[38 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Definitely yes.
[38 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And the next part's in regards to your medical history. So the question for this section is have you ever had symptoms of being diagnosed with or treated for or intend to seek medical advice for any of the following? So these are all going to be yes or no's. The first one is stroke or heart conditions such as but not limited to heart murmur, heart attack and angina. Yes or no? Perfect. The next one is lung disorder, excluding APSMA, sleep apnea or pneumonia. And the next one is cancer or leukaemia, excluding skin cancer. Perfect. The next one is kidney disorder, hepatitis or any disorder of the liver, anxiety, depression or stress requiring medical treatment, or any other mental health disorder.
[39 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, no, no.
[39 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : And have you been diagnosed with or currently undergoing testing for, or has a doctor advised you to be tested for motor neuron disease or any form of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease?
[40 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : No.
[40 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So the next section is in relation to your height and weight. Please be aware that I'm required to obtain a confident single figure measurement for each in order to continue with the application. The system does not allow me to enter any approximate figures, words, or height and weight ranges. So first of all, what is your exact height please? Yep, thank you. And what is your exact weight, please? Yep, thank you. And it says, uh, have you, have you ever had any of the following conditions? High blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes?
[40 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : 172 centimetres, 132 KGS, yes.
[40 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK, just a SEC. Umm, OK, just waiting for that to load up. OK. So, well congratulations, your application has been approved. However, it is subject to the following terms and conditions. Umm, so due to the uh, due to the BMI as well as that umm, that last questionnaire that I asked you, unfortunately we can't offer you the, the 250,000, but what we can offer you is a benefit amount of $50,000 to $100,000 with a policy term of 20 years. Now we do understand that things like BMI can fluctuate. So if, if, if you feel it's like you're eligible like that, you may be eligible for a higher amount in future. It could. BMI does change. Then we can definitely have a look at that for you again if you wanted to reapply. But yeah, currently we can offer you 50,000 to $100,000 of cover. So if you look at the 100,000, that does work out to be $395.45 a month. You've still got the terminal illness benefit included as well as the funeral advance to pay out of $10,000. But does that still work out to be better than what you've got currently? Or is it better to stick with your all right one?
[41 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : I think it might be better to stick with the Karen one. Yeah, for the amount.
[41 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, that's, that's fair enough. I assume that you took that one out quite some time ago. Yeah, sure. Well, I mean, at least we were able to, you know, get a, umm, a bit of a discount on a bit of a lower price for the wife's one.
[41 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yes, Yeah.
[42 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So hopefully that reduces the outgoings a bit for you.
[42 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Oh, certainly.
[42 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So if you did want to reapply with us in the future, then we'd be happy to take another look at it for you again anyway.
[42 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Oh, thank you.
[42 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. No worries. Well, was there anything, any other questions that you had for me or anything else I can help you with?
[42 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No, that's all. Thanks.
[42 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : All right, no worries. But yeah, if, if we wanted to reapply in the future, feel free to give us a buzz. We're open 8 to 8 on weekdays. Uh, or any questions, you know, that Donna has with her policy, more than happy to, uh, you know, to speak with her about that within those, uh, within that time frame as well. Remember 8 to 8 on weekdays. Uh, but look, other than that, I'd just like to thank you for coming to the phone today and for your patience there. Uh, and yeah, like I said, if you have any questions or queries, feel free to give us a buzz back.
[42 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK, certainly. Thank you.
[42 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : All right, all good. Have a lovely day.
[42 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : You too. Thank you.
[42 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : All right, bye. Bye.
