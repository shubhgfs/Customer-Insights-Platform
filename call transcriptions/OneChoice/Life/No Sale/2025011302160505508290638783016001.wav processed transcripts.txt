So each year around your policy anniversary, we're going to send you out some letter saying this is what your new sum insured is going to be with those associated increases in premium. And of course, you can opt out of that one each year.
[19 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : OK, very good.

[26 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : That's right, yeah.
[26 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So in order to finish setting up this payment with you now I do need to ask you 4 quick questions and read your short declaration. And I just need to click the note at the Inns of each. Of course, once we finished setting up this payment with you, you will receive confirmation of the direct debit authority both by post and via e-mail. And if you need to query or cancel this authority, all you need to do is give us a call back on 0800 zero 05804. That number will be in the those documents as well. So question number one, do you have authority to operate this bank account alone?
[26 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, I do.
[27 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Do you need to jointly authorize debits?
[27 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's a good question.

[27 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : I'm not sure actually, to be honest. Yeah. Oh yeah. No, no.
[27 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So previously when you when you set up payments on this bank account or you withdraw money on this bank account or anything like that, do you and your wife both need to cosign or you're able to do it by yourself?
[27 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Did it by by myself.
[27 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So being that you're able to do it by yourself, so you need to authorize debits.
[27 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No, probably not.
[27 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. OK, now have you cancelled a direct debit authority for one choice? What's Pinnacle life as the initiator in the last nine months on the account you're providing?
[27 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[27 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[27 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it should be fine. Yeah.
[27 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Are you happy to set up a direct debit authority without signing a form survey? Now in order to proceed, I need to read the following declaration and I'll need your confirmation at the end. So this is a short one paragraph declaration in regards to the direct debit and it reads you agree. This authority is subject to the terms and conditions relating to the bank account provided and the specific directive of terms and conditions that relate to this authority. So authorize your bank to allow Pinnacle Life who is the initiator for one choice to directive of this account in accordance with these terms and conditions, yes or no?
[28 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's fine.
[28 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So that's that's all set up for you there Grant. So $62.45 that'll come out on Monday the 20th and then it's going to be every second, every second Monday thereafter. So all that says for me.
[28 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Hey, just to be a tank and I I think I've changed my mind R around. I'd rather sign a form to authorise the debit. Oh, OK.
[28 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, so we don't actually send out any forms for you to fill out in regards to the direct debit. That's why we do ask that question so that we're able to gain the authority to umm, direct debit your account.
[29 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, that's fine.
