[9 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : I see, thank you. I'm just gonna give you a quick little recap as well of which we covered for what's included in the policy. There is a rehabilitation benefit as well which can assist you to return to work with the rehabilitation benefit which pays an additional reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit to a maximum of $3000 to help with rehabilitation costs or claiming. Or we can reimburse up to six times your income benefit towards cost of equipment or modifications required to assist you to return to work. The premium is stepped as well, which means it will generally increase each year's age. And in addition, the policy also has automatic indexation, which means each year your sum and short will increase by 3% until you reach a maximum benefit of 15,000 per month and with associated increases in premium. And you can choose to opt out of this indexation each year if you want to. OK, And here's one last step to do here for you. We just need to read to you the final declaration. So this will take about four minutes to read through, so you have to bear with me through that.
