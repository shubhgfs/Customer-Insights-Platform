[8 seconds][Agent] : How you doing Journey? Hi, my name is Aiden. I'm from One Choice Insurance. How you going today?
[17 seconds][Customer] : Hi Rebecca, speaking not too bad. How can I help?
[24 seconds][Agent] : The reason I'm calling you, you made an online enquiry for our life insurance earlier this afternoon. So of course that's the reason I'm giving you a call. Umm, I will be able to run you through the insurance. What up some pricing, I just need to double check. I'm speaking with Rebecca Dixon, date of birth, the 30th of the 3rd 1988. And you're a female New Zealand resident currently residing in New Zealand.
[37 seconds][Customer] : You are sure is, Yeah, yes.
[49 seconds][Agent] : OK. And then I need to let you know as well. So all of our calls are recorded and any advice I provide is limited to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they are suitable for your needs. We do not consider your personal circumstances. So thank you for inquiring with us today. Can I ask you what sparked your interest? What's made you start looking into life insurance for yourself there?
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Me and my partner have just bought a house.
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK, Congratulations to you. Some exciting times, I'm sure. Be very busy as well. Yeah, be full on. I know what it's like. It's very full on.
[1 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK suddenly no, but we have access to the shed and stuff so we can start moving from outside.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Have you moved into the new home just yet or how Good. Well, best of luck with the whole moving process. That's the biggest trouble of it all.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : But it's where when everything is, where it needs to be, it's all worth it. So again, really happy for you both. So I assume that it would be more to cover the mortgage raising that you're looking to take out carbon.
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : That's completely fair enough. Because as you're aware, being a life insurance policy, it's really designed to give you that pace of mind. In the unfortunate case that you passed away, we do pay the entire lump sum directly to your loved ones. So you you'll be in complete control on to receive some money at every stage of your policy. We do provide you with a beneficiary's form, so whoever you then nominate is who's going to be receiving that money directly at that time.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : And then with the funds available, there will be in complete control on how it's used.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : If it's purely to cover the mortgage or if there's any other expenses of bills, loans, even some more of the immediate expenses like the funeral cost as your loved ones can request an advance out of 10,000 to help with more of those immediate expenses then, uh, so I can load up some pricing. Just need to confirm a few things. Your most preferred title would it be miss misses or miss it?
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I'm not married, so I don't know.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : It's one of it's bad. It's whatever you I'll only be referring to you as Rebecca is miss OK, MI double S All right. And have you had a cigarettes in the last 12 months?
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : I don't know what they want meeting Yep, all. I've never stopped.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Oh, good on you. Very healthy lifestyle choice. Umm, I understand you've never striked just for the call recording. I do maybe here a yes Sir. And or have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Thank you. And is your current and your income $50,000 or more?
[3 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK. We can offer you cover from minimum of 100,000 to a maximum of $1 million. There is then $50,000 increments in between. For example, the minimum is 100,000. That's about one 5200 all the way up to 1,000,000. I can see when you looked at our website you were looking at the $600,000 benefit. Is that the one you're thinking of at the moment? Yeah.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, I I just thought, you know, it would help.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I just thought no, it would help. Umm OK umm, so I would be.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Well, the, the way that it sort of works is I don't earn as much as my car, so I would be more lucky in it how much it would be if the policy was on him and me. So like I'm still looking at both.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : I understand that to both of you to be insured, Yeah, No, that's fair enough. We would need to speak to your partner, just so you know, umm, to be able to provide some final pricing and umm, go through it with him.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : So I can mostly start with your side and then umm, and then at an available time for your partner, we can have a discussion with them as well.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Right. Yes.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but yes, I say.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : So I was thinking about 600,000, 'cause he's got two kids and then with the mortgage, bills and everything else with one income, I think the 600,000 should make it comfortable for him for a couple of years at least.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : I understood not. I appreciate you explaining. Well, if we were to look at insuring you for 600,000, it would come in at a premium of $21.28 per fortnight, $10.64 per way. You could equate soon again, that's leaving $600,000 behind for them.
[5 minutes][Customer] : OK, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : How does that sound in terms for affordability at the moment?
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : That's, that's not too bad.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sounds affordable.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : I'm happy to hear that. It really does need to be affordable. So again, I'm pleased to hear you say that. Just if over the years, right?
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So what happens over the years? Like do we lock?
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Should we?
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Is it like a mortgage sort of interest rate? I've heard people talking about how over the years it get more and more expensive.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : I've heard people told me that, umm, how are you? It is a step premium, so we'll generally increase each year. But what I can do, I can show you indicative figures on how it does increase. You have an idea of that? Umm, just please be aware that all our premium projections are indicative only and assume that you do not make any amendments to your cover.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So again, premium as of now, it's $21.28 per fortnight if you're keeping the 600,000. The same if we have a look at say 2025, that would be $22.21 per fortnight. Uh, twenty, $2623.48 per fortnight, 2020 seven, $25.12 per fortnight. So that's an indication of the first three years. Did I give you a good idea on what that looks like?
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Mm, hmm.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Now, of course, it needs to remain affordable throughout the whole policy as well. Now we do understand as time goes by, uh, it does, financial circumstances may change, children get older, mortgages could go down, could even need more cover, who knows. So you can apply to increase the amount up to the age of 70, subject to a legibility at time of application. If it's the other way around, you can apply to decrease the cover at any stage of your policy, umm, or by giving us a call if you wish to do so. So, umm, what we'll go through next there, Rebecca with this price, I've just told you, it's purely an indication at the moment. The reason I say that we do keep it nice and simple to apply with it over being over the phone with yes or no questions.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK Yep, Yep, mm. Hmm.
[7 minutes][Agent] : And that's what's going to confirm what the final price will be in the exact terms of the policy. So we'll have through those questions for you now.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : No problem.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, Uh, there's just a quick paragraph that I need to read to you and this is going to let you know what to expect to the questions and what we expected. You are completing these as well, so rates please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes. We collect your personal information to provide insurance quotes, issue cover and other related services. We will share this with your insurer and make sure it's with other service providers for the purpose of administering your policy or handling claims. Our privacy policy tells you more, including how to access and correct your information and lodge complaints about breaches of privacy. I also need to inform you about your duty of disclosure. So before you enter into a life insurance contract, you have a legal duty to provide to us any information you know or could reasonably be expected to know, which may affect our decision to insure you at the more times. You do not need to tell us things that we already know or should know as an insurer or it reduces the risk. We insure you have this duty until the time we enter into the contract. If you fail to disclose the matter or you make a false statement in answer to our questions, we may be able to decline a claim, impose new conditions on your policy or avoid your policy entirely. So the clear yes or no, can you please confirm? Do you understand this? OK. So with the questions, very simple hold and lifestyle questions just require clear yes or no for each place. But if you need me to clarify anything along the way, just please do let me know, OK? The first question I do need to read out is are you a citizen or permanent resident of New Zealand or Australia? Currently residing in New Zealand, yes or no?
[8 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep, yes.
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, next section. Now it's a pre qualifying medical history. It's rates.

[9 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Completely understand that. Thank you so much for letting me know. So sorry to hear about the passing of your father as well.
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[9 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : I just have some drops down questions I do need to ask.

[10 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK so I've answered a yes for that first one. So then it asks how many episodes have you had which required treatment? Have the option to select one to two episodes, 3 to 4 episodes, five to six episodes, or seven plus episodes.
[10 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : How do you mean by episodes?
[10 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Let me reach you a definition and should clarify it and then I'll have some examples at the end that I'll read out as well. Umm, sorry if someone has sorry, give me one second. There we go. So an event. An episode is an event, occurrence or reoccurrence of symptoms with increase severity from normal mood and usually require either medical intervention, referral, treatment or alteration slash adjustment to existing maintenance treatment. Treatment can take the form of medication and social counseling slash therapy. If someone has mental health symptoms that require treatment, this is an episode and if they return to their doctor several times to monitor the situation and social for repeat prescriptions, this is still the same single episode. If, however, they have a relapse or symptoms worsen and treatment needs to be changed or increased, then this constitutes a second episode. Similarly, if the applicant recovers and treatment stops and the applicant is fine, but at a later date, symptoms return and they have to go back to the doctor to seek further advice, this would then be a separate episode. So that's where it's asking you of how many episodes have you had which required treatment? So would you say we wanted to? Yeah. Yeah. Appreciate you letting me know.
[11 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : OK, I had one, one episode and it would have been 10 years ago.

Have you had symptoms or treatment for this condition within the last six months? OK. And then it just asked, have you ever seriously contemplated or attempted suicide? OK, That is all we need to capture as part of that. I just wanted to thank you very much for your patience and your honesty with that. I know these things are never easy to talk about, so I really do appreciate your patience.

[12 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : With that, let's move on. The next question asks you, have you been diagnosed with a terminal illness, motor neuron disease, any form of dementia including Alzheimer's disease, or been told by a doctor that you have a condition that will reduce your life expectancy? In the last 10 years, have you used illegal drugs, abused prescription medication, or received treatment or counseling for drugs or alcohol consumption?
[12 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[12 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Next section now. So the next section is in relation to your height and your weight. So please be aware that I'm required to obtain a confident single figure measurement for each in order to continue with the application.

[17 minutes][Customer] : So it was like they scared my body into fixing itself. Yeah.
[17 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : I say, OK, so it's just naturally just umm again, well, apart, that's actually a thing, you know, where they provide the joint procedures without doing an absolute thing and it's just tricking the body.
[17 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : So that was good.
[17 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah, absolutely. Umm, but Even so, that could be a form of treatment. So everything was successful with that and umm, your follow up smears have been normal since.

[19 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Mm, hmm. Bagel.
[19 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : So vespal vagal syncope basically means if I stand up too fast, I think.
[19 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Mm. Hmm. I understand that. OK, because I've experienced that, of course, not to the point of painting. So it's just like I heard it was something to do with like blood pressure dropping or something in the lines of that or?
[19 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[19 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Right. I see.
[19 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : So my brain seem to tell the veins in my legs to contract when I stand up and it doesn't.
[19 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Right. OK. Right. Mm. Hmm.
[19 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : But it was exasperated by the fact that I never drank water, so being dehydrated at the same time was terrible.
[19 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : It's a combination of it all.
[20 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[20 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : I understand. Good on you.
[20 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So now I drank at least 2 liters of water a day and I haven't had something since.
[20 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : I understand. OK umm, does your condition require ongoing medication at all or other forms of treatment?
[20 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[20 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK, when was your last, uh, when was the last doctor's consultation for your condition?
[20 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Year and a half ago.
[20 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK. And have you made a full recovery?
[20 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : It it probably won't either go away. My mum had it and still has it. She can be quite naughty about not drinking water.
[20 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, really.
[20 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. She's terrible. Yeah.
[20 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, just a lot. No, just not a fan of water or what is like my favorite thing. I think I drink about 7-8 liters of water a day. And that's not even which, like, actively try. I just love the water.
[21 minutes][Customer] : I know, I I don't know what it is. She's like, oh, I had heaps of water today.
[21 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : It does.
[21 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : I'm like, in your coffee does not count.
[21 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : It absolutely does not get out. She's trying to bottle a little blue, blue bowl.
[21 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : And she's like, oh, yeah, it's just so.
[21 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Uh huh.
[21 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : And I'm like, no, because the caffeine dehydrate too fast.
[21 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Exactly.
[21 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Then the water you're taking in, you can't, I can't understand it.
[21 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : She says there's water in the cup. There's water in the cup. I love that little loophole she's trying to do. Oh, too good.
[21 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, it's funny.
[21 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and you just with this last question, umm, do you require ongoing check up in the future? OK.
[21 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No very much self managed at this point.
[21 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : I'll note that down.
[22 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. When I'm standing up, I just take it.
[21 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : It's very soft, manageable and that story essentially checking water and just when you're standing up, you just take it a bit more easy or yeah.
[22 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I just found where my water is perfect. Yeah. So I just, I drank water. I yeah, I don't know.
[22 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[22 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : I can still dehydrated, obviously everybody can, but I know. I mean, I should be taking it easy when I can't.
[22 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I understand now. OK. So essentially if you drink more water, that is the treatment for the symptoms, OK. OK. And if you aren't sure of the diagnosis, what tests would so you don't know what the diagnosis was. OK, so we can just put that in and what kind of tests did they do? Was it like blood tests or any scans?
[22 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, they did blood tests. I had to wear a heart monitor for three days. So is it, what is it called?
[23 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yep, it's a hold on hold to monitor.
[23 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : That's yeah, yeah, the EEEKG Holter.
[23 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[23 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[23 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK. And those tests, did they come back all clear or is there anything found?
[23 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : They picked up on the EKG about the fainting 'cause they, I did it in the paddock. I, they told me to, if I, if I could on the last day to really work myself hard, try and make it happen.
[23 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Right.
[23 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : I, I went out and I worked all the horses in the paddock all in one day. And I bloody passed out of the paddock And they were like, well, what, you know, they, they've seen what was happening and, and they asked me what I'd been doing.
[23 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah.
[23 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : And then I think I took blood tests and all sorts of stuff and the conclusion came back with dehydration and the Vesco value syncope.
[24 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Right. OK, wow. So I told you, you just wanted a pure root to the cause. So they told you to work, work as hard as you can, and they got their answers.
[24 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, they did. It was. It was good, actually.
[24 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So you have to do a bit of a sacrifice.
[24 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[24 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, not a worry. I've noted that down. Now. I really do appreciate explaining that for me.
[24 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : No worries.
[24 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : That's what we need to note down. That's part of that question.
[24 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[24 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So let's move on. The next question asks for disorder of the stomach bell or pancreas. Yes or no?
[24 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[24 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Hepatitis or any disorder of the liver, Epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's disease or paralysis, Bladder or urinary tract disorder, Kidney disorder, blood disorder or disease, Sleep apnea or asthma, excluding childhood asthma.

[52 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, we have a big barn down in the paddock, so they kind of just bored there, but he's come to the realisation there's not going to be room for a door at the new house.
[53 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I say, I say this is a hard time for him.
[53 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : He all actually was here the other day.
[53 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that would be like his children.
[53 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Compared to sell truck, Yeah. He's like, you know, spent quite much time working on it and, like, not going to get any better than it is now.

[53 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yes, he has. He has done lots of it. Yeah.
[53 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Oh would have been his baby.
[53 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : But then the cooker, the cooker came and he was like, well, now you've got so many horses, what are you going to do with them all? You're going to get rid of some of those. And I'm like, Oh no, what do you mean?
[53 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : He went with the realization of what to do with the cars, and now you have the same realization, just with your horses.
[54 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[54 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : You're both battling through it.
[54 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Well, unfortunately it's easier to sell the vehicles than it is to sell the courses.
[54 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Absolutely. Yeah. What do you think you would do? How? Well, you've got a lot of horses, don't you?
[54 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : I do.
[54 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Five horses won't be enough room.
[54 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I've got 5 and I just had, I just had two files.

[54 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, most, most of it was my friends just going, hey, I've got a Petit, Yeah.
[55 minutes][Agent] : But worse comes to worse, they've got a good home for the sounds of it. Good stuff. Uh, just with your postal address. So I assume that would be, of course, just fine for that one as well. Yeah. Oh, OK, I say it.
[55 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, just if it if it comes to the house, it'll go to the garage, if that makes sense.
[55 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it definitely does. So if I note down your home address as your postal address, it'll go where it needs to. You'll still be able to receive that.
[55 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[55 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : All right. Perfect. OK, Umm, now just a couple of other quick things just to double check with you. So as I was mentioning with referring this off to the insurer, if it comes like fully approved, no changes in any way, we have the option where we can accept it on your behalf. So are you happy for me to record, record your acceptance of this policy now and we'll send you out all your policy information to your e-mail and postal address, noting again if it's fully approved. No, no changes in any way, shape or form. Yeah, that's bad.
[55 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : I will probably hold off because I applied for quotes from so many people today and I am almost guaranteed sure that Josh has probably gone and done exactly the same.
[56 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Really. Yeah, just being organized. Yeah.
[56 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : So I'll Wai, I'll yeah, I'll wait and see exactly what was got on the table and written cases before I say yes.
[56 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. But I can understand that. I respect that you're looking to find the best problem and the best company to have your life insurance with.
[56 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[56 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Have you heard back with any other companies just yet? Yep. Mm Hmm.
[56 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : So we checked when we applied for a loan, they gave us some quotes and stuff of that and for the full coverage, which was like income protection and everything, I think it was going to be like $60.00 a month.
[56 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK. Is that just for your side? OK, with income protection and life insurance.
[56 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[56 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Alright, Income protection, that's something that's in the works at the moment and should be coming out within the next couple of months with us. Sorry, it is something that is coming, but I can't of course offer it just you until it has launched. Uh, if that's something that you want to look into in a bit more detail, we are currently taking expressions of interest on our website if that's something that you're interested in. Uh, but at the moment we are offering the life insurance. Is that something that you're, you're wanting to have an income protection as we speak right now or? Mm hmm.
[57 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, yeah, 'cause the the whole thing is, is, is something happens to me, just can afford all the all the mortgage repayments and stuff by himself. But if something happens to Josh, I have no hope in trying to manage everything.
[57 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I say, I say OK, because he's, so he's more prior like priority to get like income protection cover as well and life insurance at the moment. Would it be? I understand that, but I understand again you want advice about so, so he's also being taken care of. Umm, so looking at a few different options. I understand the, the decision is entirely yours.
[57 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[58 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : We've gone through the heavy lifting with outside now, so we've completed all those questions. So I'll leave the decision to you If you need sometimes to work out the other options again, perfectly fine. Take as much time as you need.
[58 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No worries.
[58 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Uh, the other option you do have available when I understand that you don't currently have any cover in place at the moment.
[58 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : No, no problem.
[58 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Is that right to say, OK, the other option you do have available is if you were wanting to have something in place while you're working through all your options and looking through all the information with lining it up with us. And if it noting you both will be approved and put in place. You can have that Peace of Mind that you're immediately covered while you're doing everything you need to on your end of looking around and comparing the document side by side. If it turns out we end up being the best cover for you, This is just the beneficiaries form we ask you to fill out and send that back. But if we work out no longer being the best option, there be any locking contracts, no cancellation fees, more designed again to give you the pace of mind that you covered while you're doing everything you need to on your end. Would that suit you better at the moment?
[59 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Bye, yeah.
[59 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Alright, well with that second option, it is finalizing it. So we would need to select a preferred payment by, sorry, preferred payment date and preferred payment method as well.
[59 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Bye.
[59 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Umm, would you be happy for me to record your acceptance of this policy now then if it comes back or fully approved, no changes in any way, and then we send you out all your policy information to your e-mail and postal address.
[59 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Bye, yeah.
[59 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Alright, umm, in terms for lining it up, as I was explaining, you wouldn't need to make any payments straight away, you know. So if you wanted to keep it in line with the pay cycle or if you have a preferred day at all, I'm hoping to help you with that. Now, when would work best for you? When would you like the first payment to be?
[59 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : It would probably need to be next week on Friday.
[59 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : I can do that. So our policy would all commence noting it for fully approved from once we get the outcome back. But you just wouldn't make any payments until Friday the 9th, 2024 and then every fortnight on the Friday for you. OK. And then lining it up, we can do this either a direct debit using an account number or a Visa or a MasterCard. What would work best for you?
[1 hours][Customer] : Yeah, my debit card.
[1 hours 12 seconds][Agent] : OK. Before you read out any numbers, we do pause the call recording. It's purely for your security. So I can just like that up for you now.
