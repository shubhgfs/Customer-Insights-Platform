Well, we can graduate some pricing together. I mean, it is great that obviously you see the importance of having cover. Did you originally take it out because you've got children or a mortgage?
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : I do pay annually but it's quite a bit so but I wanted to see what your premiums were and and I don't have what I'm paying on hand but I can't get it but I'd rather not both.

And if you were looking at leaving that money behind for your children, obviously it's an, an opportunity for you to do so basically, if there's, uh, it, it's there to be able to provide you with the Peace of Mind that if something does happen to you, then your family does have that financial security. OK. You're welcome to nominate up to five beneficiaries who will receive the benefit amount and you get the selective percentage for each. And you are, they are able to also request an advanced pad of $10,000 to be able to help out with funeral costs or any immediate expenses that you may have when you pass away.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, Simple to apply for cover with us as well. We don't ask you for any medical checks or blood tests or reports. What we do is we take issue health and lifestyle questions that we ask you over the phone. And those questions confirm the eligibility for the cover and also the pricing. OK. But we'll go through a quick quote now, an indicative quote to begin with. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Good on you. And you are welcome to choose a benefit amount from 100,000 to 500,000. Now I know that you mentioned you look that you have a policy in place that's 360,000. Umm, our increments do go up by 50,000.

[4 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Now if you're placing an existing policy, it recommends that you do not cancel it. And so you have reviewed this policy in force. That might not be identical to your existing cover. Umm. And with regards to the pricing, how does that compare so far?

So what I can do for you is refer you to ensure a Pinnacle life to complete an online application or I can provide you with information and a quote on our funeral cover product with our funeral insurance. Anthony, there's no questions that we ask you over the phone. So acceptance is guaranteed or we don't ask you these wholesome lifestyle questions. Which would you prefer? Beg your pardon?
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : I'm the same big Skitter I've been. You can do it on the phone.

[9 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So I can refer you to our insurer, Pinnacle Life to complete an online application or I can provide you with information and a quote on our funeral cover products. But we don't ask you any help from master questions. Which would you prefer?
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, give me a quote. Thanks. I'm not doing cover.
[9 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : I can send you a quote. Yeah, definitely. Are you happy for me to go through some information on our funeral insurance now?
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sure, sure.
[9 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, great. So Anthony, with the funeral insurance, it does work a little bit differently where it provides a cash benefit of up to $30,000 to your loved ones when you pass away. OK. So it can be used not only for your funeral expenses, but also any other final expenses that you may have, like unpaid bills. And if death was due to an accident, your chosen benefit amount will triple. So in addition, if you were to suffer an accident or serious injury before the policy anniversary following a 75th birthday, such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit amount will also be tripled for you.
[10 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[10 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : And as I mentioned earlier, there are no medical checks so acceptance is guaranteed.
[10 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[10 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Umm OK so for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause. In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding a policy for 12 months, if you're first diagnosed with a terminate on it for 12 months, honestly by a medical practitioner, we'll pay your claim in full. So you could use that for medical cost treatment. It's up to you how you'd like to use that money.
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Now, the level of cover does range from 3000 to 30,000. What amount would you like me to quote you on?
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Quite new on the highest physical.
[11 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : 30,000 of course, yes.
[11 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[11 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So $30,000 of funeral cover is a fortnightly premium of $83.27 and the accidental series in your component triples to $90,000. How does that sound for you?
[11 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : OK. It sounds good.
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Great. Now once you reach the age of 85, your premium premiums will cease.
[11 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[11 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, so the policy will still remain in place for you, but you won't actually have to pay your premium anymore once you reach that age? Yeah, it is good. And the 25% bonus cover will automatically be applied to your benefit amount. All right. Now our funeral insurance policy also does provide you with an early cash out option. So anytime after you reach 85 years of age, you may choose to enter cover and we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit.
[12 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[12 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK. And your premium is a level, which means the designs not increase as you get older. So you know what you're paying each for that.
[12 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[12 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : All right, So can I please confirm, can I please confirm you understand the cover we're setting up today is for no cover and that you are happy to proceed. Umm, I don't want.
[12 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : I don't want to proceed just yet.
[12 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : I just want to.
[12 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : I just want to actually understand the cost of it and then I can need to go through the session with you.
[12 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course, certainly. That's totally fine. I can give you that time to obviously discuss that with your wife.
[12 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Alternatively, if you are happy to proceed, I can go through a little bit more information with you and be able to send out your post documentation for you to review. What would you like to do?
[12 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, just send me the docu. Well, yeah, just let me review it with your wife first. If you have any other information that you need to send, send me if you could send it to me so I can actually review that with my wife as well. Yeah. Just like, do you have brochures on this as well?

[13 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Do you, I don't think it's N no, I don't have the insurance but to say, but obviously if I did pass, it gets paid out anyway. You know, I guess that's part of it, I guess.
[14 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, uh, is the life insurance, you mentioned that you're not sure exactly what you're covered for under the policy with the life insurance.
[14 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. I need to have a look at that as well, comparing and have a look at it in conjunction what you have in terms of funeral cover. Yeah, yeah.
