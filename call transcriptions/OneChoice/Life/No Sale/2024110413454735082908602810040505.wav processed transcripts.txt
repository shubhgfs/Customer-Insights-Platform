[1 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.

[1 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So would it be like your, your your first time that you'd be getting together or OK, umm, no. So, so, so with the with with the questions, it's just individually done. Of course, you can line it up together in terms of payments. It can be done similar way just with each license should be required them to complete the run application.
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK. That's cool.
[1 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but I can run you through your 1 so we can see how it all sounds there for you.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yes. Yeah. OK.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : But understanding, you know, you'd want to cover the mortgage or anything like that if anything happens to either of you, which with our policy, it's mainly designed for that kind of Peace of Mind in case anything happens to you, You could leave it to your partner alone or you could nominate up to a maximum of five people based on which way you wanted to do that. Now what we, what we, I'm sorry, did you have a question?
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : No, no, that's OK. Yeah.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, Umm, what we also provide is 2 advance payments. So within the one insurance you have a death, terminal illness and funeral cover. So the advance payments are the funeral and the terminal illness advances the way that the funeral advances.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : It's a sum of $10,000 that your partner could request at the time of the claim to look after funeral expenses. And then we also have a terminally ill advance payments as well where parasitically this doesn't happen to you. But if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we will pay the full sum.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Ensure that you have to as a lump sum and then you could use that whichever way you liked at that time as well.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK, cool.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Now I'll bring up the estimated pricing there for you. How this is calculated is based on your age, gendersmaker status and, and the amount that you look at as well. If it is something that works for you, though, you're not required to then go book in a doctor visit to do any complex medical checks or anything like that. What we have is a health and lifestyle application, which is those questions we talked about before that we take you through over the phone to let you know the final pricing in terms.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, OK.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : And then, uh, your partner can just do a similar one as well. It's a nice and easy process we do over the PHO.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Sounds good.
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Now with that. Paris, can I confirm that you are a female New Zealand resident currently residing in New Zealand as well. Wonderful. And have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Perfect. And with your pre tax income per year, would that be above $50,000 or less than $50,000?
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, No, I think it's, I think it's like borderline. I'm not too sure if that's slightly above or lower.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. Yeah, that's OK.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : And I think it might be like slightly lower, but only by a few 100 OK.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : That's completely fine that that's not an issue. That's OK. I mean, sometimes it's not something you can think of off the top. Calculate tax and everything into it. Umm, but based on that, you can look at cover anywhere from a minimum of $100,000 up to a maximum of $1 million as well. However, their Paris understanding, you know, with the house, things can change over time.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So that's why the good news with us is it is a flexible insurance.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK, cool.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So you're not fixed into one figure where you can only have one amount at a later time. As long as you're eligible, you can apply to have it increased as well.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, cool.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : And, and and that's something you just need to let us know of. As long as you're eligible will increase that there for you.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK, cool.
[5 minutes][Agent] : Now with that, how much would you like me to look at for you? Just to start off with, we can go anywhere from 100,000 to one mil. Of course. No, that's OK. So 400,000 of cover there for you for the death terminal bonus and funeral cover within the one insurance would be a premium of $12.79 a fortnight there for you. Yeah.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : I, I'd like to compare it to Westpac figures and I think we went worth 400, $12.00 and you said 79.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, but how does that sound?
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Hey, a fortnight.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : No, that's good to hear.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : That sounds a lot better than what they could offer us fortnightly.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : But the they had a slightly higher for the funeral, only another 5K That's fine, I'm not too fussed about that.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : And then for the sickness and illness they had three, it sounds quite similar, three different. I'm not sure what it's called. Maybe is it policies? Is that the right the right word?
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : No, Sir, within the one insurance, it's one policy there for you. It's just different benefits, different ways that you can claim back from the cover there as well. But that way we cover you for different things that can be included in the policy there for you now also.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : This is really sounding a lot more affordable.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's good to hear. Well, with that, what we can do is I can take you through that application there. That way we can just confirm if there's any changes or no changes at all. Just based on your answers. They've that, that terms may change or there may be no changes there for you. Uh, but after that I'll let you know the final pricing in terms and let you know what the details of the cover and we can see how it sounds for you then as well.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, OK. Cos sounds good. OK, Yeah.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : 111 key thing I need to read out to you before we do that is what's called a pre underwriting disclosure and what this information tells you are the reasons why we collect your details and then also about your duty of disclosure as well.

[18 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK, sweet.
[18 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : And the way that that works is still with those 3 components of the cover that we touched on before, the way that the death benefit works. Now Paris, of course, you're still young at 24, so hopefully nothing happens to you anytime soon.
[18 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[19 minutes][Agent] : But the policy does cover you from from the day you start the policy immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[19 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[19 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So if anything happens to you, we can pay that out to your partner. You can receive that in full and then that way the mortgage would be well looked after and anything else that may be needed at the time as well. You can never know when these things happen. Second part of that there as well is the terminally ill advanced payments.
[19 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So, uh, hopefully this never happens to you, but if you were diagnosed with 12 months or left to live by a medical practitioner, Paris, just let us know. We can then pay out the 400,000 to you in full of a lump sum.
[19 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[19 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : And that way you can then use that whichever way you need at that time as well. Maybe for medical expenses or maybe income replacement, whatever you need. We'll be able to support that as well.
[19 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah. Oh, of course.
[19 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : And then your partner can also let us know at the time of the claim if they'd like to use the $10,000 funeral advance, which that gets paid out generally within a business day of us receiving the completed documentation as well. And that way that can be used for funeral expenses right away. Final detail here, Paris, please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year.
[20 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[20 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : In addition though, this policy has what's called automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amounts that you're insured for. So for example the 400,000. Will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium, but that isn't something that is mandatory. So you can actually opt out of that indexation each year if you don't want it to stay the same. And you if you if you don't want it to increase, sorry and you'd rather it just stay the same as well.
[20 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, Yeah, OK.
[20 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Now with that, what we can do from here understanding of course, you guys were looking for that Peace of Mind to make sure mortgage would be covered if anything happened to you.
[20 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[20 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : We can get your policy or started from today. That way you have that Peace of Mind. It's all up and going. The key thing is though, you don't need to stop the payments anytime soon.
[21 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[21 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : You could choose a later date that works for you at a later time, but we'll send you through everything via e-mail so that of course, you can show your partner and then that way you can let us know to do here's one, but we'll also post out your documentation to you as well.
[21 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : OK, cool. OK.
[21 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Now, Paris, you do have a 30 day cooling off period from whichever payment date that you select.
[21 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. Mm, hmm.
[21 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : What that means is that if you change your mind about the insurance and cancel it within those 30 days, you will receive a full refund of the premiums that you've paid unless a claim has been made as well.
[21 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[21 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Can I confirm your your ad, your e-mail address? Sorryihavehereispariskeppa@gmail.com.

[22 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK, Thank you.

[23 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK, no, sorry.
[23 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK. That's alright. I'll just reconfirm it there for you just so that I just so that of course, umm, umm, you're aware of it. It doesn't change anything to, it's to the, to the, to the approval or anything like that. It's just something we leave in your application. So it's accurately disclosed there for you. Umm, so the, the question in there was, umm, other than what you've already told me about. In the past three years, have you sought medical advice or treatments by a medical practitioner or a specialist? Or are you awaiting the results of any medical test slash investigations? We can actually leave that in that one because there's a drop down quote section here. Just confirm it was a pregnancy if no history of complications with current or any previous pregnancies.

[24 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. No worries. That's OK. So I'll just leave that there for you. Again, that doesn't change anything to your approval anything like that at all.
