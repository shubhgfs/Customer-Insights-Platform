[13 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : It's so yeah, that's alright. An episode is an event, occurrence or recurrence of symptoms with increase severity from normal mood and usually require either medical intervention, referral, treatment or alteration adjustment to existing maintenance treatment. Treatment can take the form of medication and or counseling or therapy.
[13 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. Yep.
[13 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So I've got 3 examples here. So if someone has mental health symptoms that require treatment, this is an episode and if they return to their doctor several times to monitor the situation and also repeat prescriptions, this is the same single episode. If, however, they have a relapse or symptoms worsen and treatment needs to be changed or increased, then this constitutes a second episode. Similarly, if the applicant recovers and treatment stops and the applicant is fine, but a later date symptoms return and I have to go back to the doctor to seek further advice, this would be a separate episode. OK one, just the one. OK so I went on the anxiety medication. Mm hmm.
[14 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK, it's one because I'm sure I went on the anxiety medication and then I was like, I stopped taking that.
[14 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : And then I was like, I stopped taking that and then I just went for some counseling just to help me. I'm just saying, you know, umm, coping mechanism for the brain injury and getting myself back to, you know, before.
[14 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : And then I just went for some counselling just to help me understand, you know, coping mechanisms for the brain injury and getting myself back to, you know, before I had the incident.
[14 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yep, Yep. Certainly. All right, so, so we'll capture that to the one to two and asks have you had symptoms or treatment for this condition in the within the last six months? No. And have you ever seriously contemplated or attempted suicide? No. Excellent. So moving on from that, have you been, have you been diagnosed with or currently undergoing testing for as the doctor advised you'd be tested for measure neuron disease or any form of dementia including Alzheimer's disease?
[14 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.

So I went to that friend's place and we're having a barbecue in the afternoon. It was like in the afternoon and booked people, one toilet in the house, lots of people using the toilet. I was like, I can't wait, I can't wait, come back.

[35 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : So I'm stood up, stepped back pulling the pants up obviously and there was nothing behind me. And down the bank I went and there was concrete stairs. So So what happened was I had the shear bag luck.
[35 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Oh, no, yeah, yeah. Oh, no. Oh, wow.
[35 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : If it was just grass, it would have been OK, but it was actually concrete steps that I landed on yes.

I said this has caused me to have a brain injury. I need this bladder fixed. I'm just leaking all the time. I just can't. I can't I just you know, I can't live like this. It's causing me too much stress. I said, and anyhow, she goes, well, you're not the problem was. And she said your friend should have more than one toilet. I said, oh, it's a bit rude. I said, 'cause most people can actually wait. But I said I was at that point where I was just, it was just giving out on me, you know?
[36 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : And I said, and it's, even though I had other stuff in there, like, you know, it's not that problem to capture. Not when your bladder is really full. Sometimes that's just not enough.

[38 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : I don't know because I would have been unconscious and then I would have done whatever they've done and made the decision to operate.
[38 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[38 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : And then when I woke up from the surgery, I had a fractured collar bone and the brain injury. And then that was it pretty much. And they put me in a brain injury unit for about PR probably lasts four or five days there. And I just said to my daughter, Get Me Out, I'm going home. I'll take care of myself, which I probably was good because I wasn't happy with the care and the brain injury. And I was articulated enough to know that this wasn't gonna work for me.

But they say your brain rebuilds itself if you use it. And so it has rebuilt itself. And, you know, I'm sucking along really, really well, you know, and I've put certain things in place, you know, but you know, I use the diary like notes down and I'm perfectly fine.
[39 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yes, yes, I have to do that regardless. Yeah.
[39 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, sometimes some people say to me, I'd do that. And it's, it's called old age or forgetfulness. And I went, oh, I'm not that bad. I'm actually probably better than most people. I remember a lot of things. So I retain a lot of information and most of my work loads quite big.
[39 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.

[48 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'm happy to proceed because at the end of the day, I think I'm just sorry, I'm just doing my math.
[48 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : You're right.
[48 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : So let's put Fortnite.
[48 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : That is per Fortnite, yes.
[48 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Hey, so 90 per week, 90 per week. I've still got the other policy in place that I'm paying fortnitely on. I didn't know whether to wrap that one up as well, but I got the other one for 60,000.
[48 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : I've still got the other policy that I'm paying Fortnite and I didn't know whether to wrap that one up as well, but the other one says 60,000.
[48 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : I'm paying $40 a fortnight on.
[48 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : I'm paying $40 a Fortnite on.
[48 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : I'm just wondering if I just did this for 3300 thousand. I'm sorry.
[48 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : I'm just wondering if I'd that's all right.
[48 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : I'm just thinking because I still got a secondary one for 61,000. I'm paying 40. Yeah. What is it, $40? No, no, no, that I'll just leave that 16 because that's $80.00 a month. That's not.
[49 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yes, well, let me have a look at what the pricing would be for the 300,000 for you.
[49 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[49 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : I just say, you know, you're with all the info there, so just give me one second there, OK? It's just gonna make me skip through these questions without answering them, uh, asking. I just need to go in through and, uh, quickly skip through the model. Umm, bear with me. Alright, so while I'm doing that, umm, while your application is being assessed to be covered for accidental death, which pays out if death was due to a direct result of an accident and cover under this last and for the insurer makes a decision on your application or 30 days from today, whichever is earlier. All right, now if we were looking at the $300,000 of cover, it is a fortnightly premium of $207.00 a fortnight.
[49 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, 1105 a week.
[50 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Uh, yeah, that, uh, it would be under that, yeah, approximately.
[50 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : OK. Do I have to make a decision on which one or can you approve me on one and I can up it to the other?
[50 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Uh, do I have to make a decision on which one or can you include me on one and I can add it to the other? Well, you're not locked into any contracts with us.
[50 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Just I'm just or do I have to decide?
[50 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : You don't need to side right now. So you're not looked into any contracts with us. So you can choose one or the other right now and if in the future you in the future you decide. Look, you know, I would like to either have them together or not have them together. Umm, you know, you can apply to an increase decrease subject to eligibility. Yeah. OK.
[50 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, alright, 'cause I'm, I'm, I'm just trying to do my calculations.
[50 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : I was just to find and do my calculation. Yeah. Calculate how much we've been paying my husband and myself to get on that other one. Mm hmm. And what that's the biggest chunk And then, yeah.
[50 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : I might, once I get off this call, calculate how much we've been paying my husband and myself to get on another one and what was the biggest chunk and then plus my separate one and work out whether it's better just to go for that 300,000 and just go get rid of both of the chub, the signal ones for me.
[51 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So with the with the 300,000, it's $103.05 a week.
[51 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[51 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep. Get into one payment.
[51 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : OK, I'll probably go with that one and just get rid of it and just cancel the others because at the end of the day, it's yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just, it's just all over the place. It's very higgly higgly, you know what I mean?
[51 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : And I'm just like, so I just, I ain't trying to track it all, but I've rather wrapped up my hair coming out in one lot Cos if I do that other lot 90 and then the 20 or with the other one, I would be about 110.
[52 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Hmm. Mm.
[51 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : I'm only paying myself $5 a week, so I don't know. I don't know how much half do I need? How about that was. Yeah, OK. And then when you went on the fridge, I can drop it back.
[52 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Well, if you like, we can set up for the 300 and then if you did want it, yeah, if you decide you wanna go with the 2:50 instead. Yeah, just a matter of giving us a call to apply to have that re reduced. Yeah.
[52 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
[52 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : All right, no problems. All right, so the commencement of your cover will be subject to the final assessment by the insurer if the insurer of the, uh, approves coverage. No, without any changes.
[52 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[52 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Are you happy for me to record your acceptance of this policy now? And we will send you out all your policy information to your e-mail and postal address.
[52 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yes. So this is a life cover.
[52 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yes.
[52 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : I just, sorry, I'm just drawing it down there. This is a life cover. And like you said, if anything does happen to me, my family can access it for funeral. I think I'm more covered with funeral only. I've got that many super funds. And then the other side of it is it's say I do get something, cross my fingers in my toes, doesn't happen. I've been tracking really well. So something like 10 years down the track and it's like a cancer or something. We don't have cancer in the family, but if I think it's something 10 years down the track, it pays out. Is that my understanding?
[53 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, if I think there's something ten years down on track, umm, it pays out. So so the generally I'll advance payment so that if you diagnose you 12 months or less, you leave by a medical practitioner, I will pay the full amount out to you while you're still in. Yep. OK, no worries.
[53 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : OK, Alright, OK, alright, no worries. Yes. Alright then that is a yes from me.
[53 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK, beautiful. Alright, So what I'll do is I'll get your preferred method of payment and what day you prefer your payments to come out and we'll get that sent off to the underwriters. So as far as when the payment comes out, we won't take anything out until such time as the underwriters have approved it. And as I said, if there's any changes to what we discussed today, I will be speaking with you.
[54 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[54 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Uh, but, umm, when would you prefer your payments to come out on a fortnightly basis?
[54 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : I don't think it really matters. I get paid monthly for them on a salary.
[54 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Umm, I don't think it really matters if I get paid monthly. OK. Do you want a monthly, uh, payment? You can do fortnightly, monthly or annually. It works out.
[54 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So I'm just trying to think it doesn't increase if it's monthly, does it doesn't change monthly?
[54 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : It works out the same on an annual basis. It sounds more when we're looking at monthly because we provide it so it's an even payment. So it's not up and down each month. Umm, so I just do a fortnightly then I just, it doesn't matter.
[54 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Does it look just do AI just do a fortnightly then I it doesn't matter.
[54 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : I just leave money in my account all the time. Yeah.
[54 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : I just leave money in my account all the time anyhow. I've got a floating account that just whatever comes out comes out and I spend what I spend.
[54 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Umm, I, I placed an account, whatever comes out comes out. OK, OK.
[54 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, I'll just go with that one.
[54 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Umm, yeah, I'll just tell it that one. Yeah, alright. No problem. Is there a preferred day for it to come out for you? Oh, OK.
[55 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Question asking someone because the other one came was coming out of my husband's account but now I'm doing this independently because every both of us has wrapped up coming out of his account but he doesn't keep an eye on anything as we've just found out.
[55 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep. All right. Would you like me to set up for say, Wednesday next week? Umm. And then that way we can make sure that that will you know, it's set up for when after the underwriters are gonna hopefully help. We'll we'll should have come back with a good decision. Yeah.
[55 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : So look it I don't think it really matters to me as long as I'm if it comes out monthly, sorry if it comes out monthly, how much is it a month?
[55 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, let me switch it over the monthly and then we can look at that. OK, so monthly it is just waiting for the pop up.
[56 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Just a monthly.
[55 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Uh, it's $448.50 a month monthly.
[56 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : I get paid on of every month yeah, it just makes it easier.
[56 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep, Yep, no problems at all. And what day of the month is it? Uh, 16th? The 15th.
[56 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : I know it only goes in 15th so.
[56 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what we'll do is I can make that for the, uh, do you want it on the 16th just in case it's like going in?
[56 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Sixteenths.
[56 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yep. All right, so we'll set it for Monday the 16th of October and then each month on the 16th after that for you. OK, all right now, uh, do you want it coming out of an account or card they carry in?
[56 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, because it was a card last time and I think that's what went wrong.
[56 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Uh huh.
[56 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : My husband's got a new card sent out and that's why it all started to fall over with the other one.
[56 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK, all right, let's use an account.
