[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Uh, yes, sure. I don't blame you with the current circumstances out there with everything increasing. Yeah, I must admit that I've actually done the same thing and taken a step back to review all of my insurances as well.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : All right, yeah, well, let's have a look at some pricing for you there. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Excellent. Is your current annual income $50,000 or more?

[3 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : I think it's about 700, which is on our last policy. So say the same. Yep.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, certainly no problems at all. So if it's $700,000 to cover, you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $65.54 for yourself there. How does that sound for yourself?

[13 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, now I'm scared of heights and shocks.
[13 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Chicken. Yep, Yep, Yep.
[13 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So no way, no hell, look, a lot of people I speak to on a daily basis are the same. It's very rare I get any answers to yeses to those.
[13 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Pretty, pretty extreme.
[13 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. All right. Well, Logan, thank you very much. That's all the questions taken care of.
[13 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Cool.
[13 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : And congratulations, your application has been fully approved with no additional exclusions or loadings.
[13 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Sweet. Cool.
[13 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : That means that we will have you immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. There is also a living benefit included T called a terminally ill advanced payment. It is something we hope that is never actually needed. But it does mean that if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we can actually pay that claim to you in full while you are still living. So if something like that happens, you've got that Peace of Mind of having the financial support to help with any care or anything.
[14 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. Cool.
[14 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, maybe do an extended trip to Bali.
[14 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
[14 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Now your beneficiaries are able to request that advance payout of $10,000 to help with any funeral class. So you've got the Peace of Mind of knowing that Maria has got that financial help as well.
[14 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm, correct.
[14 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Now, please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 5% with associated increase to premium. Now at the end of the day, this is your cover. You know it's best for yourself and your circumstances at any given time. So you can opt out this indexation each year, but it, it is something that we'll offer to you on an annual basis. So you've got that control and flexibility.
[15 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Cool.
[15 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : All right. So which level have you leaning more towards there Logan, the 8 or the 700,000? Probably the 800.
[15 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : No, probably the 800 just only because of everything going up and price and stuff like that. And I mean, it's $10 a fortnight, it's $5 a week for 100 days. So it's probably something around there.
[15 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : But I, I think if you could e-mail that stuff through, I can have a talk to Maria tonight and just work out what, umm, where we want to sit with it all and then come back to you because it all mean all of that pricing sounds pretty reasonable. So.
[15 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, certainly. Well, there is actually two options that we can go do at the moment. So I can send you out that pricing and general information to have a look at. That's no problems at all. The other alternative would be to put the policy in place today and send out your policy documents over the phone. Now we will e-mail the documents in full to you today. That way you can sit down and compare both policies side by side and discuss it with Maria to be which is one as best yourself. The policy does give you a 30 day free look. So that if you did decide the policy wasn't suitable for you and chose to cancel within that 30 days, you'd receive a full refund your premium unless the claim's been made. And that way you can actually physically see what you are covered for.
[16 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep, OK.
[16 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Make sure you've got the right decision to do that. All we would do is select your preferred method of payment and set a payment date for in the future. You don't have to make any payments today, OK?
[16 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, so I, I mean, I work from home anyway, so I can here at lunchtime anyway.
[16 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK.
[16 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : So if you see that, if you've flipped us an e-mail, I can, we can have a chat at lunchtime and then I can come back to you in a couple of hours and and we can sort that out.
[16 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely. No problems at all. So I'll send that through to you to logan.maria@extra.co dot NZ.
[16 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : So Yep, Yep. Awesome.
[17 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. No problems at all. I'm actually here until 6:00 PM this evening.
[17 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Cool.
[17 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : What time would be good for me to call you back?
[17 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : What was that?
[17 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : What was it uh, what time would be good for me to give you a call back?
[17 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, probably say 2:00, something like that. I'll, I'll generally go in there about 12, one o'clock, something like that. So yeah.
[17 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, yeah, yeah sure. Look, no problems at all. I've just sent that through. Keep an eye on your, uh, junk and spam.
[17 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah. Yep.
[17 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : It is system generated, so it does sometimes pop into bed depending on your firewall and everything.
[17 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Cool.
[17 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Uh, but it is on its way and umm, I'll give you a call after two.
[17 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[17 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : See how you have gone.
[17 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Awesome. OK, thanks.
