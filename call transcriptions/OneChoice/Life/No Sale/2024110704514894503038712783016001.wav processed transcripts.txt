I do hope you never have to use that one. And whoever you selected the beneficiary, they can still request the funeral advance payout of $10,000 as well. But please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year. In addition, this policy is automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. You can update this indexation each year. Now I do need to let you know that the price has risen a little bit just because of the BMI reading and the raised blood sugar.

The policy. It also has a 30 day calling off. If you decide the policy is not suitable and decide to cancel within the 1st 30 days, you will receive a full refund of your premium, unless of course the claim has been made. But I hope you don't make any claims in the 1st 30 days. A little bit too soon. OK now because we post it all, I need to confirm a home and a postal address. But do you know what your post code is?

[30 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : What's the main thing that you did need to read?
[30 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Start again.
[30 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : What's the main thing that you did need to read? Yeah. So we have an income protection policy as well. Yeah. So what we could do is we could sign you up for the life insurance and then go through an income protection quote if that works, because you can actually take out both life insurance and income protection. There's sets of policies, but you can take out both of them.
[30 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Is there any other cover like in in income protection cover because you know, because of the construction industry you know for OK, OK.

[31 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK.
[31 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : It's OK. Yeah.
[31 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Another question, what California can, what about can I take income protection alone or I have to take life insurance together?
[31 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So you could if, if you wanted income protection instead of life insurance, then we can look at income protection. Just leave the life insurance for now.
[32 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[32 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, well, what I'll do is I'll take you through, I'll take you through our income protection policy now. And then after we've gone through that, I'll be able to let you know what the outcome is. And you can either take out income protection, take out life, where you can even take up both of them if you'd like to. But once again, it always comes down to affordability. OK. So I'm just going to go into, I'm just going to go into income protection quickly.
[32 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK. So I'll let you know how income protection works. I wanted to know, are you new to income protection? No, I know that you have the income protection policy at the moment. Have you ever had any before that with that? Is that the first time you got some?
[32 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Oh, the the income protection is is I don't have income protection.
[32 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Oh, you don't have an income protection? No, that's OK. Did you used to have one? Yep.
[32 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, with that's what I said on the other, my other insurance company, they started off with including income protection, but they took it away.
[33 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I see.
[33 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : And just so that's why, you know, in the construction industry right now in New Zealand is in a low, you know, 20 people are under and sometimes you can find work, sometimes you don't.
[33 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I completely understand. And I know a few other people who have that problem.
[33 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : But look, the income protection policy is quite new. We've only had it for just over a month now. So what I'll do is I'll explain the main features and benefits and then we'll go through some pricing together.
[33 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[33 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Now I just, I just have a few initial questions to go through shortly, but how income protection works, is it, it's designed to provide a monthly income benefit paid directly to you if you are unable to work due to a disabled sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. So it's designed to help cover your bills and living costs if your salary is interrupted. And you can apply if you work at least 15 hours per week, you're paid employment. So what we do is we offer an income benefit of up to 75% of your monthly pre tax income starting from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. And just like our life insurance is all done over the phone with no forms or medical checks. Now we've already gone through some of the questions. So some of the questions are the same as the life insurance. So we're not going to need to go through any questions that we've gone through. It's only the ones we haven't been through.
[34 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[34 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Now after we go through the questions. And if you are accepted through the policy and once it's in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 75th birthday. Keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the policy document. And also keep in mind that the premiums are generally tax deductible. So you can always talk to your tax professional to find out a bit more about that. But I'm just going to open some initial questions first. Now before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty of disclosure to answer all of our questions accurately and honestly and fail. Failure to do so could impact your cover at claims time. OK, perfect. So let me open the first question. Do you work 15 hours or more per week? Yes or no?
[35 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And what?
[35 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Oh, perfect. And I know that you, you told me you're under the construction industry. I'm just going to ask this next one anyway. But is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature? Will you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment?
[36 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm outside, Yeah.
[36 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yes or no outside. So we'll put a no for this one then. Do you spend most of your time outside?
[36 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[36 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Put a no for that one. And do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle? Yes or no?
[36 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No, I in the construction site, I don't drive, I don't operate machinery, but I do car petrol work.
[36 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK, so would that be physical duties? Heavy physical duties.
[36 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Not a heavy physical because there are limitations that we have to do with.
[36 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. Look, look, let me you said you don't drive a vehicle at work, so we'll say no to that part of the question.
[37 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[37 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : With heavy physical duties, it may include driving commercial vehicles or operating machinery. Now I know that you don't drive commercial vehicles at work.
[37 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[37 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Do you operate any machinery and are you does your job, does it require you to carry, lift, push, pull, or operate heavy machinery at all? No, we'll put a no for that one. And then heavy machinery, also known as heavy equipment, refers to powerful vehicles, the machines designed for construction, mining, or earth moving that are typically used for tasks that have too difficult or impossible to perform manually. And some of these tasks will be digging, lifting, or transporting large items. Do you do that at all? We'll put a no for that whole question there.
[37 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no.
[37 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Now the next question, are you qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role? Yes or no?
[38 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Skilled. Yeah.
[38 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Skilled? Perfect, thank you for that. And the next question, do you work in any of the following fields, aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces, or do you handle explosives? Yes or no? Perfect, put a note for that one. Do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights above 10 meters, work offshore or carry a firearm, Yes or no? Well, thank you for answering those initial questions for me.
[38 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : No, no, yeah.
[38 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK. I'm just going to go into some prices for you now. So this just takes a little bit of time to load. So it shouldn't take too long. Now. Also keep in mind that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year to age. And I'll be able to let you know what prices. But I need to start with the smoking question. Have you had I, I know I've already asked you, but I just have to ask it again. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no? No, Perfect. And I need to confirm your employment. Are you currently employed or self-employed?
[39 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : No employed.
[39 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Employed. Perfect. Thank you for that. Now what we need to do now is, is determine your your pre tax income. So I'll provide you with a definition of pre tax income. Pre tax income is the total annual remuneration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses. However excluding employer, Kiwi saver and super contributions. Now based on that, what is your annual pre tax income?
[40 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : And multiple tax $65 an hour by 30 by 52, 72K72K.
[40 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : $72,000 yeah. Perfect. Thank you for that. Is it exactly 72 or is there any other dollars as well?
[40 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : 72800.
[40 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : 72800 Thank you for that. OK, so based on your duties and income, you can select the monthly benefit amount starting from $1000 being the lowest and up to 4549 dollars being the highest. Now did you do you want me to select the $4549 or do you want me to select another amount? Perfect. So we'll go 4549, which would be the 75%. OK, so there's two other things that we're going to need to select and I'm going to go through them with you now. So the first thing is the waiting period. Now what the waiting period is, it's a non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. OK, so it's the amount of time before the in before the insured event, but you have to wait until we start paying. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. So normally 90 days is a little bit cheaper, but you do end up waiting longer and the 30 days is a bit more expensive, but you know, you only have to wait 30 days. Which one of those do you want me to select?
[41 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 4000 900.
[42 minutes][Agent] : 30 days? Yep, perfect. And then the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness.
[42 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[42 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : And you can choose either six months, one year, 2 year or five years. Now obviously five years is the most expensive because that's the maximum that will pay you will be five years and the six months will be the cheapest. But the maximum that will pay you for anyone injury would be or illness would be just six months. So do you want me to select six months, 1-2 or five years?
[42 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Essex, Yeah.
[42 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Six months, Yep, perfect. Let me select the six months now. OK, Now I'll let you know what the price is and then we'll start with the questions. So the the price for for $4549 as the monthly benefit amount for 30 days and six months. So a 30 day waiting period and a six month benefit, It's coming in at $45.34 a fortnight for that one.
[43 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : How is that about sounding?
[43 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : 45 in fortnight. Oh, fortnight. Yeah.
[43 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : It's a $45.34 a fortnight as an indicative payment, so every two weeks.
[43 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Oh, oh, nice, nice.
[43 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So $45.34 every two weeks, How's that sounding? Yeah, perfect. Well, let's let me get those questions up for you now. So I'll just, I'll load them up again. Now I know I've read you something just before called a pre underwriting disclosure.
[43 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[43 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : I need to read another one for income protection just because there's a bit of a different wording and I'm just going to need confirmation after just yes or no says.

[45 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[45 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Perfect. Thank you for that. OK, so I'm just going to load the questions now. It shouldn't take too long. So it shouldn't be taking a little bit of time. It shouldn't be too much longer.
[45 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[46 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, Thank you so much for waiting there. OK, so I'm just laying the question now. We've already gone through quite a few of the questions because lots of them are the same as the life insurance. So I'm just going to skip through the questions. We went. We've already gone through. Shouldn't take me too long to get up to the right question. OK, so I've got a question about your occupation. Does your work require you to use explosives, travel to areas experiencing war or civil unrest, or work offshore? Yes or no? And I know I've asked this question but it does look, the next one is are you employed or self-employed? You already told me that you're employed.

[47 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : And do you, have you been in your current occupation for at least 12 months, yes or no?
[47 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[47 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Do you intend to change your current occupation in the next 12 months? Yes or no? OK. And do you have a second occupation that generates a taxable income, yes or no? Have you ever been declared bankrupt or placed in receivership, involuntary liquidation or under administration, yes or no?

[47 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : No.
[47 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : We'll put a no for that one and we'll move on to the next question. OK, so the overriding question, have you ever had symptoms of, been diagnosed with or treated for?

OK, I've just, I'm just go, I'm just up to the question where we you already put the strains in the hernia. It's just a little bit of a distance.

[56 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Two consecutive weeks of work.
[56 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So you basically say took two weeks of work in a row. So that's what it's asking.

[57 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[57 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : And that's all the questions I have for you. So I'm just going to load the results now. But thank you for going through them with me. OK, shouldn't take too long. Sorry, take you a little bit slow, won't be too long. OK, So in reference to your health and lifestyle answers, your application needs to be referred to the other right of assessment just for the income protection just so they can check the answers that we put down with the hernia in the scrape.
[58 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[58 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So the otherwise you're just going to check that now I, I just want to let you know what the terms will be with the policy.
[58 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[58 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So as I mentioned to you before, there's a residency exclusion where it is hereby understood and agreed that cover will sit under this policy if the life insured fees is to reside in New Zealand. So that's part of this one.
[58 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[58 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : And I also wanted to let you know that there has been a premium adjustment just like the life insurance just because of the BMI and the raised blood sugar. So I'll let you know what the price is at the moment. It does have to go to our underwriters for assessment. So it is subject to change. But the final price at the moment for $4549 of the monthly benefit for the income protection 30 day waiting period and the six month benefit.
[58 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Is $119.61 a fortnight for that one.
[59 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[59 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : How is is that still within the budget?
[59 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[59 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So what up? So there's two ways that we can proceed now. So while this is being assessed by the underwriter, what I can do is collect your payment re details and read you a declaration.
[59 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Did you want to proceed that way at all?
[59 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Come again?
[59 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So what what we can do now, just to make it a bit quicker next time, is we can always collect your payment details now and read you a declaration while this is being assessed by the underwriters. Are you happy to proceed that way, Jacifa? Yeah, perfect. So the commencements of your cover will be subject to final assessment by the insurer. If the insurer approves cover without any changes, are you happy for me to record your acceptance of this policy now and we will send out all your policy doc information to your e-mail and postal address? Yeah, Perfect. Well, what I'll do then is we'll collect those details for you now and I'll read you that declaration.
[59 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 23 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, the computer's just going.
[1 hours 24 seconds][Customer] : Can I ask the question?
[1 hours 26 seconds][Agent] : Absolutely.
[1 hours 28 seconds][Customer] : OK. She like yeah, if it's supposed and. Like 3 next month or maybe the other month I am booked for surgery OK.
[1 hours 45 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. Yep.
[1 hours 47 seconds][Customer] : And it and if I maybe after 30 days from today I'm booked for surgery OK.
[1 hours 57 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[1 hours 58 seconds][Customer] : So after I'm booked for surgery then I after surgery I need to help recover.
[1 hours 1 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah, that's a good question that one. So it's basically let me it is a bit of a new policy. So just just bear with me one minute just so I get that information up for you. So you're talking about, are you talking about the hernia?
[1 hours 1 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : I have to rest if the deficit is recovery, so by then I can utilize my income protection or yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 1 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem at all. Let me, it's a pretty new policy. So let me just double check that I'm waiting too long while I do that. But it is a very good question, that one.
[1 hours 1 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[1 hours 1 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : I'm just going to check that for you now. So it won't be too long. I just just bear with me because my computer is just going a little bit slow today.
[1 hours 1 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 hours 1 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So I do apologise for that.
[1 hours 2 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 hours 2 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So it won't be too long. So just bear with me. Won't be too long. So just sorry, just bear with me about a couple of minutes. I won't be too long. I really appreciate your patience here.
[1 hours 2 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yeah.
[1 hours 2 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, I'm just, it's just taking a little bit longer than it is, but I won't, I won't be too long so. OK, so I'm just going to find out the answer to the question so it it's not I won't be too long while I do this.
[1 hours 3 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 hours 3 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So it won't be too much longer.
[1 hours 3 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. No worries. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So do you mind if I put you just on a short hold fairly? It won't be too long. Thank you for that. Thank you so much for holding. I apologise it was a bit of a longer wait, but are you still there? Yep, perfect. So with the last one, I guess just to answer the question. So I it's gone to the underwriters now just so they can check those questions.
[1 hours 7 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 8 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : And then when they get back to us, I guess we'll be able to answer the question then just because they might put something on to say whether it would or not. But it's just a bit hard to say at the moment just because they need to do the assessment on that one, OK? So it's just just a little bit, just a bit hard to give you an answer because the underwriters could change it and then it could change.
[1 hours 8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK, nice.
[1 hours 8 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK. But what we'll do is we'll, we'll enter the payment details and read you the declaration. Now while this is being assessed, but what day would you like the first payment to start on? It can be normally anytime in the next 7 days, but we'll always try to match it up with when you get paid. Yeah, that's what day next week, Friday. So that will be the 15th.
[1 hours 8 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : So next week, Next week Friday, Yeah.
[1 hours 9 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Perfect. Thank you for that. And did you want to you, you will be covered from when the underwriters get back to us so that if they approve it with no changes. But did you want to use a direct debit or do you want to use a card? Yeah. So it's so it's, it's really completely up to you. So like I mentioned before, what has to happen now? I'm just go. I'll just explain it again. Sorry, just just bear with me one minute so it won't be too long.
[1 hours 9 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : For me to set it up here, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 9 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK. So sorry, I'll just I'll just explain that again. So basically what has to happen now is that this has to be assessed by the underwriters and they're just going to check you've those open-ended questions you went through about the hernia. They just need to check those answers. And so there's basically two ways that we can proceed. What we could do is we could enter payment details now and read you the terms and conditions now, or we could just wait until the underwriters get back. But which way do you want to proceed?
[1 hours 10 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 10 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll just have to change a few things in my system because I thought you wanted to do the payment now. So just bear with me another few minutes. I just need to change it around.
[1 hours 10 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : I'm just waiting for that and then I just get back then, yeah.
[1 hours 10 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK. So if your application is successful your cover will not start until we agree until we discuss the outcome with you and you agree to be covered as part of the assessment the underwriter, the underwriter may request additional information and if that is required I will contact you on the details that you have provided. OK, So what this off to the underwriters to make that assessment. I will give you a call back most likely tomorrow.
[1 hours 10 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 11 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : They normally get back to me very quickly with this, but it cou it could take a little bit longer. But Please note that if your application. Yeah.
[1 hours 11 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, OK, nice.
[1 hours 11 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So Please note that I'll get back to you as soon as they get back to me and I'll let you know what the underwriters say now. So we went through both income protection and life insurance. What do you want to do with the life insurance at the moment?
[1 hours 11 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : So that, that approximate figure from the yeah, I, I assume that they wait for the underwriters.
[1 hours 11 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, no, perfect.
[1 hours 11 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : So when they get back then I'll let you know of both insurance, how much check how much both together.
[1 hours 11 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, you and like I said earlier, you can take out both covers if you like to. You don't have to take out just one and not the other. They are both different types of covers.
[1 hours 12 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 12 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So what I'll do is I've put it through so the underwriters will start the assessment now and most likely I'll be giving you a call.
[1 hours 12 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 hours 12 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : It will probably be probably be in the morning and then I'll let you know what the outcome is. But I just want to say thank you so much for your time today.
