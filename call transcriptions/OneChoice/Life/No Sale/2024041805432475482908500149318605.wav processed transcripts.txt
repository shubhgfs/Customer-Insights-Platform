OK, so last question here is other than one of the events in the form of gift certificate or vouchers, do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following aviation other than is a fair playing person to on a recognized airline, motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, edge sailing, scuba diving, super than 40 meters, cable rig diving or any other hazardous activity? Look, you and me both. I like to keep both feet firmly planted on the ground. Thank you.
[26 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Now that all sounds too, too vigorous and yes, yeah.
[27 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So Mark, that's all the questions I do need to ask you for now. I'm just going to write the outcome up for you here. So that congratulations, your application for our life cover, it has been fully approved. So that was for the $100,000 with the cover and there has been no changes to the pricing at all. So that's remains at the $41.26 per fortnight for yourself. Uh, so oh. Sorry.
[27 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK, I know. I was just going to say OK, well that's I would just let the wife know that and see what she thinks. Did you want to speak to her about her policy?
[27 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yes. First off, I'm going to let you know a little bit more about this policy.
[27 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Right, OK.
[27 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So now that we've gone through and I can let you know a couple of the terms of the policy. So with this cover here, we're going to cover you immediately for death due to any cause except for suicide and the 1st 13 months. So we do actually provide you with that little bit of a need here and upfront protection there. And we also include with that cover what's called a similarly ill advanced payment. So how that one works is if you were unfortunately diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we're going to pay your claim out to you in full. So we pay this out to you whilst you're still living and you'd be able to use it on whatever you need to.
[28 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[28 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Whether there was any sort of treatment cost, whether you wanted to spend the extra time with loved ones, took off a bucket list, you know the choice there or not, that is entirely out to yourself there. OK, perfect.
[28 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Very good.
[28 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Now and since of that, yeah, sorry.
[28 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK, No, no, I was just going to ask like whe, whe, when the policies open like this and they should go through as the years go through, so will will that policy get dearer as you go through? Ho how does it work? Like will?
[29 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so that was, that was the next part. I, I was actually just about to take you through. You must have read my mind.
[29 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, cool.
[29 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Uh, but yes, so this one here, please be aware that your premium is stamped. So what that means is it will generally increase each year. So in addition to this one here, this policy has an automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 5%, uh, with associated increases in premium. And you can opt out of this indexation each year. So each year around your policy anniversary, we would actually send you out the letter saying, you know, this is what your new sum insured will be with associated increases in premium. And you can of course, update the indexation each year. So I can give you a little bit of an idea of what it would look like if you were to accept and decline that indexation. So Mark, please be aware that all of our premium projections are indicative only and assume that you do not make any amendments to your cutback. As an example, if you do not decline in the decline indexation on your policy, the premium payable in the following year's cover would be $46.23 per fortnight and your benefit amount will increase to $105,000, OK.
[29 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[30 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Now if you were to decline the indexation, the premium payable on the following year of cover would pay $44.76 per fortnight and your benefit amount will remain at $100,000, OK?
[30 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : He, Yep. No, that's fine.
[30 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And keep in mind as well. So if say for example, you set out on the $100,000 worth of cover today and in the future you wanted to increase that level of cover, all you need to do is give us a call and apply to increase subject to eligibility at at the time and same. So if you set out on a high level of cover and you want to decrease in the future, all you need to do is give us a call and apply to decrease the level as subject to eligibility at the time there.
[31 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[30 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. All right, So we'll save on the amount. Of course, I do still need to speak to your wife and take you through her one. But what I'm actually able to do for yourself on your cover and then we can go through and speak to your wife and do her one. But what I'm able to do for you as well is get yourself immediately covered over the phone today on that $100,000 policy without any sort of upfront payments or upfront costs. What we actually do is we note down both a payment day and a payment method that is suitable for yourself in the near future. Now this policy here, it's actually give you what's called a 30 day calling off. So during that time we would have sent you out all your personalized policy documents for you to review.
[31 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[31 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : You're actually going to receive 2 copies. So you'd receive an e-mail copy today that'll be generally within the next hour and then you'll receive a postal copy within the next 5 to 10 business days.
[31 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[31 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Now should if you then decide to cancel within those 30 days, you would actually receive a full refund of any premiums you may have paid, of course, unless a claim has been made. So of course again, we're not going to take any payments off you today. However, as a business we do generally click payment within the next 7 days, so when in the next 7 days would be more suitable for you?
[32 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Well, we get paid on. Well, I get paid on a Monday. So I mean, if we were to have the payments come out on a Tuesday or Wednesday.
[32 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Would that be this coming Tuesday the 22nd, Sorry, the 21st? Yeah, that would should be Tuesday the 21st and then every second Tuesday thereafter.
[32 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that can be every second Tuesday. Yep.
[32 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. OK now with that one there, what we'll do now is note down that payment method, then we'll read you the declaration and we'll move on to getting your wife's ones done. But in terms of that one there, we we do it by one of two simple options. So the first is either by a Visa debit, Visa MasterCard or credit card or the second is by a bank account number for direct debit. What one's more suitable for yourself?
[33 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : It would be a direct debit.
[33 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Is the name on the account? Is it just under your name, or is it under yourself and your wife's name?
[33 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No it's under myself and wife.
[33 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK What's the name on that account, please? Yeah.
[33 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : It is MW and M. Is it MEME, Oliver?
[33 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : ME. Perfect.
[33 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[33 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So MW and ME, Oliver, perfect. So let's go ahead and set that one up there for you now. So whenever you're ready, I'll enter in that account number, please.
[33 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Umm, we'll have to find the account number, do you know? No.
[33 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So take your time.
[33 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Hang on a minute.
[33 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : That's all right.
[33 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : And how much does that cost now? And so we're not getting sent from anywhere else? Yep. Are you there?
[34 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yep, I'm still here.

So in order to set up this payment with you now I do need to ask you 3 quick questions and read your short declaration. And I just need a clear yes or no at the end of H. So question #1 asks, do you have authority to operate this bank accounts alone and do not need to jointly authorized debits?
[35 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : No, we don't do it.
[35 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.

So when I say blood disorder or disease, we're going to can't answer yes to that one. So what's up on there? Do you suffer from iron deficiency anemia or hemochromatosis? Perfect. OK. And then ask again, have you been diagnosed? So iron deficiency is what you've been diagnosed with. OK. Do you, do they know what the cause of the iron deficiency is? OK, so that's all right.

[1 hours 6 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So gastritis, hemorrhoids, esophageal varices or ulcers, heavy menstrual fly.
[1 hours 7 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : They never even found out what was what caused that. They they just said I had low iron and then I needed to have an infusion.
[1 hours 7 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, that that's alright. I can capture it in the section where it says other causes where they can just say you had low iron and gave you an iron of fusion. OK, so the next one is so with heavy menstrual fly, is that a yes or a no?

[1 hours 7 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : OK, but that's what you believe it could be true to have have a menstrual fly.
[1 hours 7 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 hours 7 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I'm going to pop it still isn't no because the doctors haven't said that, but I can pop down when we capture about the infusion that that's what you've believed it to be.
[1 hours 7 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[1 hours 7 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : And now the next one is blood loss due to trauma and medication such as aspirin and other causes will answer yes too. So what's up on the IT? So just bear with me. When were you diagnosed with the iron deficiency? Sorry, how many times has it happened? Have you had the transfusions now?
[1 hours 8 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Which time why Oh hit?
[1 hours 8 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Twice the OK the first time it doesn't need to be around, it doesn't need to be exact date. Even if it's you know, you know it's around June, say 2018, we can pop that down. I don't expect you to remember exact date.
[1 hours 8 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK, so the first one was what was last year 22. So I think the first one was maybe June 21.
[1 hours 8 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Sometimes perfect I can put down was around June of 2021.
[1 hours 8 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : August 22.
[1 hours 8 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : And when was the second time perfect? So it was just iron deficiency. So that was the type of. So they didn't say it was a name yet. They said it was iron deficiency, was it?
[1 hours 10 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : They feel like I know.
[1 hours 10 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : That's OK, I can put down here. Are you on any treatment currently or do it just the two transfusions that you had in June, in August, perfect. So you don't have to worry about taking Xyl iron tablets or anything like that.
[1 hours 10 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Just for two transfusions, no.
[1 hours 10 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Have you had your iron levels checked recently? OK. When was the last time you had your iron levels checked?
[1 hours 11 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Not August last year.
[1 hours 11 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK, so you so you're you're not sure if your blood, your iron levels have returned to within normal range? No. OK, that's all right. Oh.

[1 hours 11 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : I can't remember 4-6 weeks maybe?
[1 hours 11 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I can put down roughly four to six weeks after last transfusion. Umm. Perfect, I've popped that one in there. And do you currently suffer any symptoms of anemia such as tiredness, headaches, dizziness, or fainting?
[1 hours 12 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Bye.
[1 hours 12 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you so much for that. OK, now that's all for that one. So we don't need to capture the regular thyroid blood test or the iron blood test. But apart from what you've already told me for that question, umm, in the last three years, have you saw any other medical advice or treatment by medical practitioner specialists? Or you're waiting the results of any medical tests, investigations AT undergoing any surgery had medical tests, investigations for example, X-rays, scans, blood tests or biopsy or waiting the results Perfect. Other than what you have already told me about, are you contemplating seeking medical advice for any symptoms you are currently experiencing within the next two weeks?
[1 hours 12 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[1 hours 13 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Thank you so much for that. And the next three question, well, the next two questions are relation to your family history. And then one last question left to go. So to the best of your knowledge of any of your immediate family, the immediate family being mom, dead brother or sister, only living or deceased, ever been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, Huntington's disease or familial epsomatous polyposis. Perfect. Thank you so much for that. Now to the best of your knowledge again, have any of your immediate family, being mum, said brother or sister only suffered from cancer, heart condition, stroke or any other hereditary disease prior to the age of 60? Perfect. Now last question here for you, other than one of events in the form of birth certificate or vouchers, do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following for aviation other than as a fare paying passenger on a recognized airline, motor racing, cashewsing, mountaineering and sailing, scuba diving, scuba diving, diaper in 14 meters, cable wreck diving or any other hazardous activity.
[1 hours 13 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : No, no, Nope.
[1 hours 14 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you so much for that, you and me. Bye now Moana. Sorry.
[1 hours 14 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Not a hope and hell.
[1 hours 14 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : No, you. You and me both. My husband has gone skydiving a few times and he's tried to drag me on. I'm like, no, I'm more than happy to drive you there and watch you try and dive to your dear. Thank you.
[1 hours 14 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Burning up?
[1 hours 14 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, exactly. I'll. I'll keep both of my things family planted on the ground. Perfect. So I wanted that's all the questions that I do need to ask you. I, I do need to let you know in reference to some of those questions that I have asked, I do need to refer your application to underwriter for a further assessment. Now, the only reason for that one is just because I had to answer manually about the Graves' disease plus, umm, the two iron transfusions that you have had. So I thought there's been no changes to the level of cover or the pricing that we're able to offer you. So we're still able to offer you the two $150,000 with the cover at $14.32 per fortnight. Now as this policy is approved, it will cover you immediately for these two to any cause except for suicide in the 1st 13 months and we still include that. Similarly, I'll advance payment. So I touched with nothing corrible like that one was to happen. But how that one works is if you unfortunately diagnosed with 12 months a list to live by a medical practitioner, we're going to pay your claim out on full and you'd be able to use that on whatever you need to. OK. Now Mona, I do also need to let you know that please be aware that your premium is set. So what that means is that would generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has what's called an automatic indexation. So each year around your each year your benefit amount will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium and you can opt out of this indexation each year. So each year around your policy anniversary, we're going to send you out a letter saying this is what your new sum insured is going to be with associated increases and premium. And of course you can opt out of the indexation each year.
[1 hours 15 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[1 hours 16 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, so Moana, there's a couple of ways that I can refer this one off to the underwriter. So First off and foremost, option 1 is what we can say is note down a payment site payment we set and get this one assessed by the underwriter. And then whilst your application is being assessed, you'll be covered for accidental this which case, if this was due to direct results with an accident, Now cover under this license until the insurer makes the decision on your application or 30 days from today, which if the one is earlier. Now the commencement of your cover would be subject to final assessment by the insurer. If the insurer offers cover without any alterations on your or your application is unsuccessful. Are you happy for me to record your acceptance of these outcomes now? And I'll leave you a voicemail to confirm the outcome.
[1 hours 17 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 hours 17 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. OK, so with this one here, we wouldn't actually take any payments off you today. However, as a business, we do generally click payment within the next 7 days. One in the next 7 days will be more suitable for you.
[1 hours 17 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : So the same day as Max?
[1 hours 17 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Which was Tuesday the 21st and then every second Tuesday they're after.
[1 hours 17 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : That's fine, yeah.
[1 hours 17 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Perfect OK now with this one here, we'll note down that payment method now. So I do this very securely over the phone by one of two simple options. So the first is either via a Visa debit, Visa MasterCard or credit card or the second is by bank account number for direct debit. What one's more suitable for you? Perfect. Is that the same bank account that marks yours? Perfect. OK, I'll need to grab those details again so I'll just confirm. Was it MW and ME?
[1 hours 18 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Bank account sure is, yeah.
[1 hours 18 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. OK and when, if you are ready, we'll start with that account number again please. Yep, Yep, Yep. Perfect. So that's O1 O 707-0823 seven 48 suffix 00 perfect. So I do need to ask you the same directive questions that I did ask Mark. There was a clear yes or no at the end of eight. So question number one, are you happy to set up a directive authority without signing a form? Question #3 do you have authority to operate this bank accounts online and do not need to jointly authorize debits? Question #3 have you cancelled a direct debit authority for one choice was a pinnacle life as initiated in the last nine months. Perfect. And in order to proceed, I need to read the following declaration and I'll need your confirmation at the end. I'll just confirm that bank account is with ANZ, correct?
[1 hours 18 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : 01 07/07 08237 4/8 00 yeah, yeah, yeah, no, yeah.
[1 hours 19 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So in order to proceed, I'll read that declaration. So it seems you agree this authority is subject to the terms and conditions relating to the bank account provided and the specific direct to the terms and conditions that relate to this authority. You'll authorize your bank to allow Pinnacle Life, who is the initiator for one choice to direct you the first account in accordance with these terms and conditions, Yes or no?
[1 hours 19 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 hours 19 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you so much for that. OK, so that's that payment set up for you now. So $14.32 will come out on Tuesday the 22nd and every second Tuesday thereafter. Now that is of course subject to approval by the underwriter.
