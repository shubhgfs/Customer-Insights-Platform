[23 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[23 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Now if approved, this policy will cover you for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months.

[23 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[23 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now the price that hasn't changed based on your answers so far. So it's still $208.34 per month for the $2,000,000 of cover, OK. Now please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. You can opt out of this indexation each year. OK.
[23 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[23 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Now, now that we've gone through all the other features and the benefits and what some pricing is looking like, what we're going to do is we're going to send your application through for the underwriters to assess, OK? Now what that means is basically they'll just read what I've typed out for you and if there's no changes at all to the to the price or to the policy, we're able to get you your cover set up, OK? But if there are any changes, of course, I would call you and and tell you what the changes are. OK? Now what this means is we're able to pop down your preferred payment method and preferred payment date so that if you are approved with no changes to what we've just discussed today, we can get you covered from that point. And then we'll send out all the policy documents to review.
[24 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'm sorry.
[24 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Like like Occupy via either visa or online after post Visa? Like like visa or online after post?
[24 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So to, to pay it, it would be with a Visa or MasterCard or with a bank account number.
[25 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Uh, I could do both.
[25 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK. Well, what what I'm what I'm I'm suggesting now though is I'm not suggesting what what I'm presenting you as an option now is, is that when we're sending the application to to the underwrited source guests, we're able to send the details so that if it is approved with no changes, then I will accept it on your behalf. OK.
[25 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Uh, could you just, could you just uh, like after the assessment has been done, could you just e-mail the documents to my e-mail first?
[25 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : And all the documentation, of course, of course.
[25 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Because I'm comparing the price for multiple companies.
[25 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. Yeah. So have you heard from other places to see if they're cheaper or not?
[25 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Uh, no, Like you guys have the first one calling back. Yeah, I guess all the companies are having like Christmas holidays now.
[25 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, maybe.
[25 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : They're they're they're they're this one just be might be really slow.
[26 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Well, of course, yeah, I I understand. So, but do you think the price is affordable for 2,000,000? Do do you think that's a good price?
[26 minutes][Customer] : That's totally understandable because yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Like it's pretty affordable, like 200 bucks for each month. That's about same as my medical one.
[26 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK. OK. Well if you say it's affordable, OK, like like you just mentioned, you're definitely able to wait until the prices come back and you can definitely wait to see if there's another provider that is more affordable and and compared with those other prices.
[26 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, because like, like, yeah, because like all different companies have uh, different price range because you have all the highest O offering the 2 million range and, but, but the others, they're all they usually just offer 1,000,000.
[26 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So then since since you know all that and you what you've just told me, you're definitely able to do that as your option. The other option available to you today though is, is since you are thinking that not many other places offer 2 million and you said the price is affordable, We are able to look at setting up the cover in the meantime, OK, especially if it comes back approved with no changes from the underwriter, OK. And then if you do hear back from another place and they happen to be cheaper or another place seems to be more suitable, you can always just give us a ring and apply to have this policy cancelled and there's no cancellation fees attached to it.
[27 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep, no I don't want any like pre approved things. I just want the quotation.
[27 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : O OK, that that's fine.
[27 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm I'm, I'm I just a layer, you know, I always compare the price between the different sub phones.
[27 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : No worries then that, that's OK.
[27 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[27 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So what I'll do then is I'll send it off to the underwriter without your payment details and I will call, I'll call you with what the outcome is. And then if there's no changes, I'm going to e-mail it out to you, OK.
[27 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[27 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : But if there are changes, I have to tell you the changes over the phone first, OK? But while your application is being assessed, you'll be covered for accidental death, which pays out if death was due to a direct result of an accident. Cover under this last until the insurer makes a decision on your application or 30 days from today, whichever is earlier. Please note that if your application is successful, your cover will not start until you agree to be covered. I will attempt to contact you when I receive the outcome. OK And I've got your e-mail, which is Bruno zhangx@gmail.com.
[28 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
