So first example is if someone has mental health symptoms that require treatment, this is an episode and if they return to their doctor several times to monitor the situation and slash all four repeat prescriptions, this is the same single episode. If, however, they have a relapse or symptoms worsen and treatment needs to be changed or increased, then this constitutes a second episode. Similarly, if the applicant recovers and the treatment stops and the applicant is fine, but at a later date symptoms return and they have to go back to the doctor to seek further advice, this would be a separate episode.

[30 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, Riley, I understand, uh, in terms for that Touchwood, if you are able to umm, get a full approval status, of course, with the life insurance touch with any health complications or anything wants to go wrong with your home, it does mean you are approved for life. So we are able to organize a cover again, noting if it's all fully approved from the on drivers. So what I can do now is I will explain to you in a bit more detail what comes included as part of the life insurance for you.
[30 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Please.
[30 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So it is the death component. So if approved this policy will cover you for destitute to any course, just accept the suicide in the 1st 30 months. So we'll provide that $550,000 directly to your beneficiaries. And then there's a way that you can claim on your entire life insurance why you're still alive as well. And is there a timely ill advanced payment, which means if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner who will pay the entire life insurance claims directly to you designed to help with the medical expenses, other expenses you may have at the time. Ah, and then for your family, they can request an advanced payout of $10,000. And that's sort of help with more of those immediate kind of expenses such as funeral calls, unpaid bills, things like that with a cover. So please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each your benefit amount will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. However, you can opt out of this indexation each year. So Riley, again, the great news is we've finished all the those questions now all the heavy lifting is now completed. So what we can actually go ahead and do, we can complete the whole process with you today. What that looks like is we can link that up to a preferred payment method. We read your final declaration and then by the end of our phone call today, that will then be sent through to our insurer for them to further assess and purposes of doing that is once we then get a final outcome back from them, have it comes actually approved. No changes anyway. It really will be as simple as me giving you a quick call saying that's all been fully approved with the Press of a button, it can put that policy will enforce for you. Uh, I will also let you know why your application is being assessed. You will be covered for accidental debt, which pays that if death was due to a direct result of an accident, cover under this blossom to the insurer makes a decision on your application or 30 days from today, whichever is earlier there. OK. And so also linking it up, you do not need to make any upfront payments if you want to keep it in line with the pay cycle. For example, if you have a preferred day, I can also help you with that. How we do it on our end is we generally collect payment within the next 7 days when in the next 7 days would be more suitable for you.
[32 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's if I go with the plan though, right?
[33 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So this is if you go with that, this would be when your first payment would then be.
[33 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So I haven't agreed to anything.
[33 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Not quite yet, no. But I'm giving you the option of where we can link it all up for you now ready to final declaration. And then when I give you a call back, if it's all fully approved, we can then put that policy all in force for you.
[33 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'd say Friday.
[33 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So it is initially linking it up now Friday. Oh, OK, sorry.
[33 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : No, make it the next one.
[33 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : That will be the 12th of the 5th 2023 and then every for on the Friday for you on next Friday. I can do that. So again, if it's all approved and all put in force will be immediately enforced from that moment onwards. But we won't take any payments until the 19th of the 5th 2023 and then every four on the Friday from there.
[33 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[34 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll also ask you as well. So the commencement of your cover, it is going to be subject to a final assessment by the insurer. So if the insurer offers cover without any alteration, so no changes anyway at all for your application is unsuccessful. Are you happy for me to record your acceptance of these outcomes now? And if you do get a bit too busy, are you OK if I leave your voicemail to confirm the outcome with you? Oh, good.
