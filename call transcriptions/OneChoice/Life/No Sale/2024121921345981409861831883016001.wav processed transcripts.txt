[16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you. And Graham, the date of birth that we received for yourself was the 20th of the 7th, 1954, is that right? Beautiful, thank you.

Any advice I provide is limited to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they are suitable for your needs. We do not consider your personal circumstances. Now. Thank you for that Graham.
[35 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : And just so I can have a better understanding of what sparked your interest, are you new to life insurance or do you have cover in place already? OK.
[1 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : I do have one policy out there and it was taken out of it by Chubb, and that was what's that?
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : And that was a life insurance with job, was that a life insurance policy?
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that was yeah.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Right. OK, not a problem.
[1 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No Sir, I was just trying to figure out what the how much it is for certain, umm, things for insurance.
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely. So I can see that you were looking at 100,000, is that right?
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, something like that. But just run. Find out what the payments would be a fortnight.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Perfect. I can absolutely help you with that one. Now, what I can do is go through the main features and benefits of the policy and then I can take you through some pricing. Now if you do have any questions along the way, Graham, you just let me know. OK, Perfect. OK, so with our life insurance policy, it's designed to provide the financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. Now, this benefit, it could be used to help maintain their lifestyle by helping them pay off things like a mortgage or loans and any other costs that are involved in raising the family.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Basically, it's there to give you that Peace of Mind that if something happened to you, then your family would have that financial security now. Beautiful. So you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this benefit amount.
[2 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah, Yep.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Do you have an idea on who you might or who you may have already nominated or OK?
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Still still working that one out because I have a couple of waffles, but they're sort of hesitant about doing it because I don't realize that I do need somebody to think I go to sort it for me. So if anything does happen, then I know it's going to get paid and they they can try and apply for it.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Right. OK. So you're just in the process of organizing who you might nominate. Not a problem at all.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : That's not a problem. Now they can also request an advanced payout of $10,000 to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. And there is a terminally ill advanced payout included in the cover also. Now we do keep it nice and simple for you as everything is done over the phone with no forms to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete. We would simply take you through health and lifestyle questions as this will determine the pricing and terms of the policy.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Now to begin with, Graham, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Thank you.

[4 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Alright, well let's have a look here. Oh really? Wow, you'll need to give me some tips. Alright, so I'll just have a look at the range for yourself. Now you can choose between 100,000 and $500,000 of life cover. Now, I know you're looking at 100,000, so we'll have a look at the pricing for that one.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So for $100,000 of life cover, you're looking at indicative payment of $147.64 per fortnight. Now, how does that sound for you?
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. That's why I just want to inquire because it's, uh, that's a lot of state, 100,000 million. Can you get in there? Yeah.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So right now we aren't able to go lower, but look, we sometimes we do see the level and the amounts of cover. We can also change based on the health and lifestyle questions.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So it may be a case that after the questions, then there may be a lower amount that we can offer. However, I wouldn't know that until we go through those questions there. But very simple though, it's just a yes or no questions.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Alright, I was in. No, I was just running a claim there so I can get back to you. So I know.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, how about I take you through those questions? That way we can see if we are able to approve you for something and then I can give you the final, you know, the final premium and the terms of the policy and you can compare it to your current policy. Yeah, like I said it they're just yes or no questions. So they they are very simple. So just open that one up there and that way we can determine what we can offer, what the final pricing is and you can take that and compare it with your current policy.
[6 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, so the first thing I'll read out is a pre underwriting disclosure statement.
