[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's correct.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Great. And you go by this is your title and you are male news. So your female New Zealand resident currently residing in New Zealand. OK, great, OK.

[2 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Oh great, no problem. Well, I'll let you know how it works with us here in terms of that for you. OK.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So what it means by New Zealand resident is the person that resides in New Zealand at the time of application hold a New Zealand or Australian citizenship or hold a New Zealand permanent residency visa or has been in New Zealand continuously for six months or more on a temporary work visa.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK.

[2 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes, both me and my husband to work here.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Oh, perfect. Great to hear. Well, that's no worries at all and no change. When you do, for example, get your permanent residence, you can call us and you can let us know at that point.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK, no problem.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, easy now. Do you have anything currently in place, Tanya, with insurance or?
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Ah, no, no, we don't have anything at the moment. That's why we we're just looking at it at the moment. Our our previous person, we had the the payment that we had just got a bit too much because our current employer that we were, they changed our work hours. So, you know, just with the economy, everything is going a little bit bad. So the, the amount that we paid with them was just a bit too much for us to pay on a monthly basis. So yeah, that got cancelled. So we said, OK, what we want to do is we want to just look at something that covers a little bit like, you know, 700 or even 500. And just as you know, see that the pricing that we will pay for me and my husband and then the well, I also requested a funeral package from you guys as well last night. I know that they're going to post it to me now and then we want to have a look at that as well.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, of course. No worries. I'll let you bring that for you here. OK, So with our life insurance, right it and our funeral insurance, they both pay out as a lump sum. OK, so that'd be paid directly out to not any banks, Oregon lawyers or funeral directors. You can nominate up to five beneficiaries. We pay the money directly to the account. OK, So that way your family has access to the money themselves.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Now it can be you can use towards whatever area where you're thinking about this money to go towards supporting your family. Or was it going towards more like a mortgage or?
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : At the moment, the if, if the fire does so let's say if, if something happens to me, then then the money will go to my husband and, and my two children.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yes, OK.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Or it it, it's the same with my husband as well. If something happens to him, it's to me and the two kids. Yes. And then we also wanted to put it on there. If something happens to me and my husband, then the money will be divided between the two kids.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Of course, Yes, I understand. No problem.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Mm, Hmm. OK. OK, OK.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So with us with the life insurance policy, we don't offer any joint policies, any single policies, but you can still link up the insurance going out on the same payment date using the same account, if you like.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : But yeah, that would be awesome.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, the fuel insurance, we do have a joint policy there. OK.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, awesome.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So we'll start with the life insurance first.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Now with our life insurance, we have included the support covering you for death, terminal illness, and we also have a funeral advanced payout with the life insurance policy.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK OK so there is a funeral that I'll be OK.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's right. So it's an advanced payout of $10,000 to help with any funeral costs. So that's with the life insurance that's included.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : OK OK.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I'll open up some pricing for the life insurance here. I'll just confirm your smoking status. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I'm a non-smoker.
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Great, you have no problem. And your current annual income, is that about $50,000 or below? Great. So you can select Tanya for my cover starting at $100,000 as the minimum and that goes up to a maximum of $2,000,000. Now that you mentioned you were looking into the 700,500 thousand, is that right?
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : It's it's above OK, OK, yes, yes. So we, we want to just have a look how much it it will be between the 500 and the 700.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : You know, just the price doesn't because if there's not much of a difference, it will might more seem to go for the 7:50 than the the 50,000 after 500.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Let's see. Yeah, that's OK. No worries. I'll show you here. So if we started the 700,000 first, that'll be $29.31 per fortnight for you and $0.31 per fortnight.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, not the 5500, sorry, $29.00, sorry, 29 dollars, $0.31. So that's per fortnight, the fortnight. Sorry, I'm just writing everything down here.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yes, of course. No, that's fine. And then if you look at the 500,000, that is $20.93 per fortnight.
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK. Then I just ask you also, sorry, I don't want to be a pine. If we look at like the million as the Max cover, what will the payment be on that one?
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course, definitely. You let me know whatever level of cover you like, I can always bring it up. No problem.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK. 43 two things for fortnight. OK, so that's that's $43. Is that just the it's just what I will pay the fortnight and then if my husband does 1, he will pay that one the same amount. OK.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, So the $1 million that would be $43.02 per fortnight, yes, it might be the same or different because it works of your age, gender and smoking status.
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yes. Mm. Hmm.
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, because he's also a nonsmoker and then he's only a year older than me, so he's 1983 and I'm 84. So yeah, there's only a year difference between the two of us.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : I see. So his Primo generally be higher than yours. OK. Being Ola and a male.
[8 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, Alright.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, so for yourself. So we looked at those three quotes for you for the life insurance policy. OK. What do you feel you're more comfortable with? Oh, I'm glad to hear.
[8 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yes well I mean the the 43 dollars is, is already wise uh cheaper than what we paid with the previous company Umm yeah So what I wanted to do is I wanted to get all the pricing and everything and then yeah my husband we can sit down and just have a chat and then umm.
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[9 minutes][Customer] : I don't know if if it's possible to phone you back or if you can send me a mail or how does it work If you wanna apply for this umm, just so we can have a chat about it and then we can, we can go from there. Umm, because I, I haven't spoken to him about that. We're going to you know, change to somebody else. But I see to you know, but maybe we must just have a look at some other people because it, you know, sometimes it's good to shop around.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yes. Oh, I'm glad to hear.
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : But I mean, like I said, your pricing is already way cheaper than what I paid with the previous people.
[9 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah. Oh, I'm glad to hear then. So we'll keep it at the $1 million of covering for you, as you mentioned, OK.
[9 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Because with us, you have the flexibility. So if, for example, these circumstances do change moving forward, you can apply to increase your policy with us due to eligibility.
[9 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. Well, that's awesome.
[9 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : You can also apply to reduce your cover down, OK, because we understand things change. You have that flexibility with us, OK.

[10 minutes][Customer] : OK, OK, OK, OK.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and then we explain how those three benefits work in detail and then get that organized. We do it all over the phone.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK, no problem.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah. Because the process that we have here with setting up the policy, Tanya, is that you're not required to make any payments on the same day that it is set up. You can actually nominate the payment in the future. So we understand that people might have something in place already or, or just go through that with the, you know, with the family. So that way you can still do that because we send it out to your e-mail and post when it's set up. But that way you know, you, the payments is only going on the day that you select, right?

[23 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : So I can just let you know if we if our permanent residence is approved, then I can just let you guys know that that we permanent residence now.
[23 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yes, that's right. Yeah.
[23 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yes.
[23 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : That way you can apply to change that question that we went through with that application due to eligibility and then we'll let you know how that will change in regards to that exclusion that we mentioned. OK, Yep.
[23 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, no problem.
[23 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Now it's also with the application being approved, has made no changes to the quote. So that's approved for the full $1 million of cover.
[23 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[23 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : The premium is still the same $43.02 per fortnight that you were happy with being obviously cheaper than what you had previously.
[23 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[23 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Right now, I'll explain the benefits of what's included, so your full understanding of how that supports you and your family. Now, please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it'll generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year the benefit amount will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium.
[24 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. OK.
[24 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : You can, of course, opt out of this indexation each year, so you're in control of how that works for yourself. Every year, 10 year. OK?
[24 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[24 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Now the first benefit that we provide is the support for death. You have the Peace of Mind with us that there's no waiting period that you still have to go through, OK? You will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. So you have that Peace of Mind straight away, OK?
[24 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[24 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Like I said earlier, that'll pay out in full the 1,000,000 to your beneficiary that you nominate so they have access to that directly.
[24 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[24 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK? Now we also include a live a living benefit, which is a terminally in advance payment, which means if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we can pay your claim out in full.
[25 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[25 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So for example, let's say you diagnose with cancer being terminal touch who that does not happen. You can then claim on the insurance while she was still alive, OK?
[25 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK.
[25 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : That $1,000,000 will be paid out to you. You can then use that to support even medical expenses or treatment costs for yourself at the time. So instead of using your own money, you can use a repayout for you, OK? Now the reason why I explained that is because if let's say you want to get better or you live longer than that 12 months of the terminal illness, you have the Peace of Mind that you can still keep that money in full.
[25 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, yes.
[25 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : You don't have to pay anything back to us at all.
[25 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. That's not too bad.
[25 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah. And then lastly, what we include is that when you pass away, your beneficiary can request an advanced payout of $10,000 to help with any fuel costs. OK. So these three benefits tenures included in the insurance for you that comes under that premium that you're happy with. Does that all makes sense? Yeah.
[25 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK, OK, Yes, yes, it makes sense.
[26 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK, great. So what that's all provided for you. OK, Now what we can do for you here today like I mentioned earlier is we can get that organized.

[26 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : You can still touch base with your husband, let him know and show him what it is.

So if for example, you do speak to him and he's happy to go ahead, at least you know how that process works all over the phone. So if there's a time in the day he wants to give us a call in and ask for me, I can do that.
[42 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[43 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : But just so you know, on Friday, I do work late. So I do also set a call back for Friday after working hours as you mentioned.
[43 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, that would be awesome.

[43 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, great. So again, he can slip from the full range of cover, $100,000 as the minimum up to a maximum of $2,000,000. Would you like me to also quote him on the 1,000,000 to start with? Of course.
[43 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK, yes, I think if I if I can get the quote on the 700 and the 1,000,000 and then when me and him have a conversation and he says OK, maybe we must just go for the 700.
[43 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : MMM, yes.
[43 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Then what I'll do is I'll just when we phone you I'll just change mine. And then you can just put set up these on the 700 because like I said, I haven't discussed this with him yet.
[44 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : MMM, that's understandable.
[44 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : So we can decide.
[44 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : No, that's right. Yes, OK.
[44 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : So I'll get both of them and then at least he has both prices and he knows.
[44 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Of course.
[44 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : And then, you know, we can we can talk on a day.
[44 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, definitely. So if you look at the 1,000,000, OK, So that for him is $55.11 per fortnight.
[44 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, Mm hmm. 50, everyone change the fortnight, OK, 46 by fortnight. OK. So that's for him.

[44 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, yes, I wrote. That's too bad.
[44 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah. Now at the moment, I, I can't see out a quote for your husband's insurance. Yeah, because we've got to go to the eligibility with him. Right.
[44 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yes, No, that's all good.
[44 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : But you, you wrote it down so you can show him. So that way, as we explained earlier, you can go through it with him, see how it goes, and then we can obviously decide what's best for your husband.
[45 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yes, no, no, no. That's there something. So what I'll do is I'll get a week and I'll quickly have a chat with him and just discuss everything with him and show it to him. And then in next week when he's here, I'm free in the afternoon. I'll get him to just give you a call and then you can do the whole process with him as well.
[45 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right.
[45 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : And then we can get him stayed up as well. And then we can just decide on which one we want. And yeah, then we can get it all set up and just carry on someday.
