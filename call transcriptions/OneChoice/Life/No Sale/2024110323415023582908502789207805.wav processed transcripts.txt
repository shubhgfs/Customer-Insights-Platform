[1 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, actually I was just inquiring of what type of cover, like I mean does he have any type of life cover as well or is it should I have to stick to the funeral cover please?
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, let's explain how it works. Absolutely.
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : And yeah, no, my pleasure to do so. And just let me let you know first that the calls are recorded and any advice we provide is limited to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they're suitable for your needs. We don't consider your personal circumstances. Thanks, Geraldine. OK, so you can actually do the whole thing from start to finish if it's a funeral cover, if it is a life insurance, we do have to speak to your uncle himself.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes, because again, not home at the moment on this.
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : All right. Fair enough. Yeah. Yeah, of course.
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : I'm in a kick up and I just thought I was just going to make the enquiry while I could for for the funeral cover.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Of course. Yeah. Mm. Hmm. OK. How old? What's your uncle's first name?
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Can you tell me please, if if he's actually quite he's, he's actually quite vibrant, but he is getting on how much, how much cover would he get to cover the funeral costs Christopher?
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : All right, just pop this in here. And and his surname? Geraldine Wilson.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : W Wilson, Yes.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : And of course, the all important one is date of birth.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : 6th of June 1952.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : O 606-1952. Perfect.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, so he's 72 and he can choose from 3000 minimum, maximum 33 O starting at 3000, it goes up in $1000 increments. And what happens is, is that if it's a funeral cover, if you do this on his behalf, we don't even have to speak to your uncle at all. It's just a matter of he's got a guarantee to be accepted.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : He's between the ages of 18 and 79 in the New Zealand resident.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So he's a New Zealand resident currently residing in New Zealand also perfect. Now it's called a third party purchaser, but the third part sheet purchaser must be the pay as well.
[3 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So would you be paying for this or would he be?
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Me. I told him I'll I'll cover it.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Fair enough. Yeah. That's great. Yeah, That's that's fine. That's absolutely fine. That can happen. The, umm, difference between the life insurance is, is that, you know, with the questions that would have to ask them, they're ask him, they're about his health and his lifestyle. And I think you have a policy with us, is that correct?
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I do.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So yours is a life, is it?
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Nice.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Or a funeral life? Yeah.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So remember when you went through questions, we'd be doing the same thing with him, but we'd have to do it individually with him. But of course, you know, you can do this. If it's the funeral cover, the money gets paid out in the lump sum to his chosen beneficiaries. So let's just say that you took this out for Christopher and then he named you as a beneficiary, let's say, and that money gets paid out in the lump sum under the terms of the policy to you.
[4 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : However, whatever way you want to use that money is all to do with whatever you guys want.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm. Of course.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : We don't get involved at all, OK.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah. What about so in bed stand pertaining to the life cover?
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Your life cover is similar. Yeah. So you put your beneficiaries, you would have put your B beneficiaries on and so on, would you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah. Good on you.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : We yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, of course.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : No, it's, it's it's kind of surprising. Sometimes people forget, you know, sometimes they they can't forget, which is, you know, it is what it is.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Now I'm one of those guys.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Good on you. Good for you.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : I am but and but planning to the the funeral cover would be like the same way if something was to happen. So they need a beneficiary in there as well.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Correct, very simple like your own.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : We send policy documents out. He fills out the form who he wants to be as beneficiary. He can have up to five people.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : It comes back to what is the proper legal do a Bo, a binding document and beneficiaries get in touch upon him passing away.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : MMM.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : We work really closely our claims department works closely with them.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Now, the one thing about the funeral cover is, is that, and once we receive the relevant documentation that's needed, and you, as you probably know, it does not actually have be a death certificate, you know, you will actually, umm, we can have proof of death, say for a medical practitioner or police say we'll pay the funeral benefits within one working business day once we receive the relevant documentation that's needed.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. Cool. No, that's awesome.
[6 minutes][Agent] : OK, So it's pretty fast Tracks.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Cool. Because, you know, it takes time to get an actual certificate some days. Yeah. Yeah, that is.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, well, that can happen and that's why we understand that and that's why we'll accept proof of death elsewhere as well, which I find a lot of our customers are quite, oh, they're quite like, oh, that's actually pretty good because, you know, at least they have that that yeah. Oh, look, I know. Waiting on things. Goodness gracious. And yeah. OK, so when you take it out for Christopher for the 1st 12 months, he'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. OK, so there's like a wait. There, like a stand out wait. Then after that first 12 months he'll be covered for death due to any calls.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, great. Here are we still talking about how the funeral cover or life cover?
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, yes, still on funeral. Still on funeral.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. Oh gosh. OK, cool. They sound so someone getting getting confused. OK. Yep.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yep, they can. They can. Let's just stick a funeral for now.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : You know, we can have a look at the life if we want to.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : But especially because you were thinking about doing this for him, this is your option to do this for him.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : You know, the life insurance is a bit different. Of course, you know, we can get a price for it.
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : But, you know, we'd have to go through him, speak to him. But if this is something that he wants you to do and you wanna do this, yeah, your funeral would be the way to go.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. We'll we'll funeral. Thank you.
[7 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine. So yes, absolutely. So back to that little bit of information again. So for the 1st 12 months, he'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Only after the first 12 months, he'll be covered for death due to any cause. Doesn't matter what it is.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : No.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Now with the funeral cover, you might find Geraldine out there. There's some companies that have got a 24 month wait. Theirs is 24, ours is 12.
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : 24 months. Wait. Yours is 12.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, and wait 12.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so you know the way for the 1st 12 months he'll be covered for accidental death and accidental series injure only there's some companies out there, it's 24 months that they got to wait.
[7 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no. You're so so. That's cool. That's fine. Mm. Hmm.
[7 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, so ours is at 12 months. OK, so and what else? Oh, in addition, OK, so there is a terminal illness benefits already included for your uncle in this. No extra cost, of course, after him holding his policy for 12 months. OK, so he's got it in place for 12 months.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : And if he was first diagnosed with a terminal illness, if he was given 12 months or less to lead by medical practitioner, we will go ahead and pay the whole claim out in full.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : MMM. OK, Lovely. Thank you. Yep.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, got the whole amount of money in full and let's have a look at the price because we may as well while we're here, of course. Now. Yeah, I know for sure. Now what and what e-mail address you want to jot down here? Do you want to put your one down or? Yeah, what was that?
[8 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep, please, yes, please 'cause he's he doesn't have anything technical.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, fair enough. And that's understandable. This happens and we do this a lot for, you know, the people that a bit more elderly, you know, the family members take it out and that reasons of course. What's his, umm, e-mail or what's your e-mail address? Sorry.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, okjerrygerri276@gmail.com.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, at gmailperfect.com. OK, so we've got ummgerri276@gmail.com. Perfect. Alrighty, so let's pop this in and let's have a look at some pricing as well, alright? So 3000 minimum, maximum 30. How much? What are you thinking? You'd like to look out for Christopher.
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I want the maximum, please.
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Alright.
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : These multifinals ain't cheap.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : I, yeah, I, yes, I know that's for sure. But you know what? What a celebration of life though, right? So, you know, that's what it's all about.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : I actually love the meaning behind, you know, the whole and this, it's like Irish, it's like those Irish people, like. So it's all about celebrating that life that they had. So I love that.
[9 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm. OK.
[9 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : And OK, so now if sadly Christopher did pass away via an accident, OK, the benefit amount that he's insured for will automatically triple so and it'll go to his chosen beneficiaries in a tripled amount.
[10 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[10 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So for example, if he's insured for 30,000, his loved ones would get 90,000 if he had accidental death. OK, It will all.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : OK, that's cool. Wow.
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And it it's it's just a feature there. It's not costing you anything extra.
[10 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Now, there's another tripling, which is if he survives this one. So if he had accidental serious injury, OK, if that happened to him before his policy anniversary following 75th birthday, it will triple. Also in that circumstance, he's still alive.
[10 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : It's a lot, but I had a serious injury. Wow. OK.
[10 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Let's say if he was Co correct correct, but would triple it and just pay it out to him. He'll get paid out triple the amount. I mean touching water course on anything to happen. But let's say something like that happened and he was a parapegic.
[10 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Oh, thanks.
[10 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Will will pay out the triple amount.
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.

[11 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I'm I'm hearing you.
[11 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So, yeah, so it's been over $80.00 a week. OK. Do you want to have a look at a bit less or is that comfortable or?
[11 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : I'm just thinking because yeah, I'm no string to this in our family, unfortunately. So that's easy.
[11 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Oh, sorry, it's tough.
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : No, I know my the last one.
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : It's hard, hard thing to go through.

OK, well look this is OK, I can afford this and you know that's the right amount for you. Yeah, for sure. Now that's called your premium. OK, so your premium on the funeral cover, our Co funeral cover, your premiums a level, OK, which means they're actually designed to stay consistent year on year as Christopher's getting older.

And now, umm, I'm going to read this declaration and it will have a course, Christopher's name at the top of the documentation and it'll say thank you Christopher Wilson and thank you, of course, Geraldine. It is important to understand the following information. I will ask your agreement to these terms at the end and your policy will not be enforced unless you agree to these terms in full. One choice funeral insurance is issued by Pinnacle Life Insurance Limited, whom I will refer to as Pinnacle. Pinnacle has an agreement with Greenstone Financial Services and Z Limited, whom I referred to as GFS, to issue and arrange this insurance on its behalf. GFS is licensed by the Financial Markets Authority to provide a financial advice service. The advice we have provided to you is limited to assisting you to make a decision, but whether One Choice Funeral Insurance is suitable for your needs on the basis of the information you provided us about your general circumstances. When providing this advice, we've not considered your specific financial needs or goals, or considered any other insurance products or services. We have verified that you understand the cover and that you considered that the premiums are affordable. We will send you a copy of our Financial Advice Disclosure Sen statement which sets out more information which can assist you to decide whether to act on any advice we provide. 1 short question and it reads. Can you please confirm that you understand and agree to this? Yes, just yes or no?
[24 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[24 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Thank you Charlene. Your answer to the application questions and any related documents form the basis of your contact of Insurance and Pinnacle relies upon the information you have provided when assessing your application and by agreeing to this declaration you consent to be contacted by us in relation to other products and services. You can opt out of this at any time. By contacting us, you've agreed to take out a single one choice funeral insurance policy with the following cover. Christopher Wilson is covered for $20,000 in the event of death. In the case where death is accidental or if you suffer a defined accidental serious injury, the benefit amount will triple in the 1st 12 months your policy is enforced. The death benefit is paid only in the event of accidental death. Once a life insured reaches age 85, you can choose to voluntary council that person's cover to receive a lump sum of 75% of the chosen benefit amount. If you take up this offer, you will no longer have a right to claim under the policy for that life insured. This policy is an insurance policy and does not have a savings or investment component. Cover ends prior to age 85. No benefit is payable and there is no refund of premiums after the cooling off. If covered continues beyond age 85, the life insured will receive an additional 25% of bonus cover from that date and will not be required to pay any further premiums. The bonus cover is not payable if the early cash out option has been taken out. Cover for each life insurance ends on the day prior to the 100th birthday. We'll pay the funeral benefit and bonus cover for the life insured. At this point your premium for the first year of cover is $112.96 per fortnight. Your premiums are level which means they are designed to stay consistent. Year on year will only change if you're all to your cover or the insurer adjust the premium rates applying to your policy. The insurer can only make a change if it is applied consistently across all policy holders. You may pay more on premiums than the benefit amount over the life of the policy. Included in your premium is an amount payable to GFS of between 36% and 60% of each premium.
[26 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[26 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Your premium will be deducted in accordance with the authority you have provided to us. AM investors rated Pinnacle with AB financial strength good and Triple B minus issue a credit rating with an outlook of stable. You can read more about these ratings on our website and in your policy documentation. The policy documentation will be mailed to you and if you have provided us with an e-mail address will also be emailed to you today. You should carefully consider these documents to ensure the product meets your needs. You have a 30 day cutting off. During which you may cancel your policy and any premium you may have paid will be refunded in full unless you have launched a claim. 2 short questions and the very first one is do you understand and agree with the declaration? Just yes or no?
[26 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[26 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Thank you Geraldine. And the last question is, would you like any other information now or would you like me to read any part of the policy documents to you?
[27 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : You know everything that you just stated, Is it going to be in that post document where I can read it? Yeah.
[27 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yes, a policy document is gonna have everything in it, not the declaration per SE, that every word of it, but there's lots in there about the policy. You know, that looks come your way. Yeah, it'll come to home address and e-mail. And so, yeah, if if you're happy, that's OK. So, but just that last question, either yes or no. So would you like any other information now or would you like me to read any part of the policy document to you?
[27 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : No, thank you.
