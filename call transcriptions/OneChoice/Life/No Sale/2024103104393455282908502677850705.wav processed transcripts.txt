[4 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, I've been smoking for about 20 years, Yeah.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, thanks for that. So you could choose any amount of cover. So $100,000 being the lowest and up to $2,000,000 being the highest. What about do you want me to show you first, keeping in mind I can go through a few different quotes of you.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, just because of my cigarettes make obviously I think it's going to be a bit higher.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Just if you could just tell me a couple of pricings please or the the weekly payments, should I say or?
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Well, yeah, absolutely. Well, I just want to say we have 490 monthly and yearly options, but if you want, I could start with maybe $1,000,000 or 500,000 or 1.5. Do you have like any amount just to start with? Yeah, absolutely. Well, let me get the $1 million up now. Now I also just want to ask, umm, let you know that we also, you also have the option to add an extra benefits to your cover such as serious illness cover and also total and permanent disability. Do you like me to tell you about any of those also?
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : 01 mil Oh sorry, I don't hear any of that last but it went.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : I'm sorry about that. So we also have some extra benefits called serious illness cover and total and permanent disability cover. So I was just wondering if you'd like me to explain how any of those optional extras?
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : But what's what's the total illness?
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So the serious illness, yes. So basically our serious illness cover pays a lump sum benefit if you were to suffer an insured event covered under this policy. And the funds could be used in any way you see fit to assist the rehabilitation costs or even as an income replacement as you are recovering. Now. The insured events under this policy are heart attack, cancer, stroke, or if you were to undergo coronary bypass surgery. Each of these events are defined within the policy and each claim is assessed against these definitions. So with the serious illness, you can apply for coverage anywhere from $50,000 being the lowest up to a lesser of $500,000 or half of your of your chosen life insurance benefit. So that's basically how the serious illness works. Do you want me to give you a quote for that? Absolutely. So between $50,000 and $500,000. What amount on the serious illness do you want me to quote you on?
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : 1 yeah yes, please Oh yeah.
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. So to give you an idea, for $50,000 of serious illness cover that would be $15.04 a fortnight. And for $1 million of life insurance by itself, you're looking at an indicative payment of $98.46 a fortnight. So on top of your life insurance with the serious illness, it will come to a combined total, an indicative payment of $113.50 a fortnight. How does that sound at the moment?
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : 50 fifty 50,000 please yeah yeah. Fortnightly.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So that's how much it is a fortnight and that's the life insurance plus the serious illness. So the $98 indicative quote, $98.46 for life insurance plus the $15.04 for the serious illness?
[8 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll go with that mate.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely. So I do need to let you know that there are exclusions on the policy. So any insured events that become apparent before or during the first three months of the serious illness option commencing will not be covered. Full details of all exclusions are set up in your policy document.
[9 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Now please also be aware that any payment made under serious illness cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount, so that's also something just to keep keep in mind as well. Now, are you happy for me to add this optional cover to your quote?
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : When you say reduce, what does that mean? That the with the with the serious illness and reduces, did you say?
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yep, I'm I just because I, just because there's someone else on the phone. I just need to let you know that all the calls are recorded.
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah.
[9 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So any advice I provide is limited to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they are suitable for your needs.
[9 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : We do not consider your personal circumstances. I'm sorry, ma'am. What was your name?
[9 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Oh, she's my partner, Tiana.
[10 minutes][Agent] : Tiana.
[10 minutes][Customer] : She just joined with you guys just recently here.
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Oh, fantastic. How are you today, Tiana?
[10 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Not too bad. Thank you.
[10 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So I just have to read you that privacy thing and just ask your name before I answer the question. So I do apologize for that. But basically, yeah, any payment made under the serious illness cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount.
[10 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Oh, gotcha. Yeah. OK.
[10 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So it would be subtracted from the life insurance basically in a successful serious illness claim.
[10 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I understand.
[10 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, like the 1,000,000 minus, minus the $50,000.
[10 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I understand. Got it. Thank you.
[10 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you. Now, do you want, are you happy for me to add this optional cover to your quote?

And then after the 1st 13 months he'll be covered for suicide as well.

[25 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : I also just wanted to let you hear right that there is a terminally ill advanced payment in the cover as well. So what that means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we'll pay the benefit amount to you in full just to help with any of those medical expenses at the time. So that's one of the other benefits as well. And your beneficiaries will still be able to request a funeral advance payout as well of $10,000.

[26 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[26 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So the type 2 diabetes and the BMI. So it has changed. We're we're able to offer you a cover of $50,000 to $100,000. So you'll still be able to get some cover with a policy term of 20 years. It's just changed a little bit just to get your answers to the health and lifestyle questions.

[27 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no problem at all. Well, what I'll do for you then is get you immediately covered over the phone today, and I will send you all the policy documents to review as well. I'll send them to you by e-mail and post just so you can get the electronic and the paper copy.
[27 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[27 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Also do keep in mind the policy gives you something called a 30 day calling off. So if you decide the policy is not suitable for you and you cancel within the 30 days, you will receive a full refund of your premium unless you've made a claim of course. Now the final thing I need to do to finish setting this up for you and send you out all the documents is we enter bank account details but we don't require any payment on the day. We normally collect it within the next 7 days, but we always try to make it work with either a payday or a benefit day or even a pension day for some people. Would you like your first payment day to be in line with your pay cycle?
