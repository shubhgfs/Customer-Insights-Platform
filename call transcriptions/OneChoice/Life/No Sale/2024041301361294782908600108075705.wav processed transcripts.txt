[1 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Well, I see that you have Pinnacle as an underwriter and I'm currently with Pinnacle but because of my marriage breakdown and my husband owning my policy, he won't sign my policy over to me and Pinnacle can't help me so I have to go for new life insurance.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : I understand. I'm so sorry to hear what you're going through at the moment.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : No thank you. But that is what it is.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : No, Yeah, no, I get what you're saying.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : But you'd think that you'd be able to fix your own life insurance policy in situations like this. And so I thought, well, I'll try someone else.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, I understand that. Oh, I can definitely see you see the values and benefits in having life insurance as you already have a policy and are you looking for a new insurance as well? Who are you trying to take care of?

[2 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, well, I appreciate you letting me know about your situation. In regards to the life insurance, as you're aware, it's designed to have financial protection for the people that mean most to you.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Now you're going to be in control. And who receives the money?
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : At every stage of your life insurance, we provide you with a beneficiaries form, whoever you then nominated to receive the funds directly at that time with the life insurance. Also, it's simple and easy to apply for. There's no medical checks where you need to go to the doctors and have blood tests or physical checks, nothing like that at all. What we do is run you through some yes or no questions over the phone. This is what will then determine the pricing in the terms of the policy for you.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll grab a customized card for you there. Kelly, I just did ask a couple of quick questions.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Sure.

[4 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sometimes.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Sometimes the hazard stays.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it does.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So regards to the amount of color we did offer for you telly, we have the options from minimum of $100,000 to a maximum of $2,000,000. It goes up by $50,000 increments for example, 100,152 hundred all the way up to $2,000,000. Do you have an amount in mind that you feel like would be best to be covered for your life insurance? Yeah.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : I was thinking probably about 750,000. I am currently covered for a million, but I don't know sort of how much difference it would be in costing.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Did you want me to show you both the 750 and the 1,000,000 and you can let me know what sounds best.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that would that would be cool. Thank you.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Not a worry. If you look at $750,000, it's a fortnightly premium of $21.53. So it's actually $10, approximately $0.77 per week for the $750,000 cover.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Really. Wow.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, you sound very surprised. Hmm. Mm. Oh, really?
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, I'm paying $100 at the moment and for my husband, 'cause I was paying his, I'm paying 140 for him for 750,000.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : I see.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : So I'm yeah, no, that's, that's a a bit of a payment.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : I say bit of yeah, good surprise.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it was.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : And you sounded very surprised. But now I know it's a good surprise. I'm happy to hear that.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Umm, just for your information as well, if we look to increase that to the 1,000,000, it's then $28.65 per fortnight. So it's approximately about a $7.12 per fortnight difference for the $250,000 difference between the two.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I might do the 750,000 first and then look at increasing it later on.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yep, No worries. Just give us a call. Yeah, not a worry, Dime.
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Like then I know if something happens, I know they're covered with educationers.

[24 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : I got that. Oh, good. So how many of your immediate family suffered from cancer?
[24 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : She's had skin cancer. And then my grandmother had it, but she was probably in her 70s.
[24 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : I'll just let you know it's our in terms for immediate families referring to mother, father, brother or sister.
[24 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, perfect. Just one.
[24 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, So I've noted down one. And then how many of your immediate family suffered from heart condition and social stroke?
[24 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : No one.
[24 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : No one. So I've noted down zero there and other hereditary disease.
[24 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Nothing.
[24 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Nothing. OK. So I just want to make sure I've got that correct. So if you can't, I have one, uh, heart condition, anthestral stroke, zero and other hereditary disease 0. That's all correct.
[24 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[24 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And very last question for you, Kelly. This is the hazardous pursuit. So every other than one off events, a gift certificate, slash vouchers. Do you engage in or intent to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fair paying passenger on a recognized airline, motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, AB sailing, scuba diving deeper than 40 meters, cave or wreck diving or any other hazardous activity.
[25 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : I'd like to say yes, but no.
[25 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So hazardous activity, I wouldn't like to say yes, that's for sure.
[25 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : I don't know.
[25 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Not at all.
[25 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : It sounds exciting, but I think that too much, too much of A worse.
[25 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : I'm the same. My biggest spirit of my life is height, so I cannot understand how anyone does any of those kind of things.
[25 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no. He won't get me jumping out of the aeroplane.
[25 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, I don't get the point. There's gravity for a reason. So why defy it?
[25 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Exactly. Exactly.
[25 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So I'll just confirm with you. So what is a confident note for that question? That's correct there, Kelly.
[26 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[26 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : No worries. All good. Sorry that comes to the end of the application. I'd like to thank you very much for your patience while going through these questions here.
[26 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Perfect. Thank you.
[26 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So it's just letting out this outcome. No worries, bear with me. OK, sorry, uh, in reference to your health and lifestyle answers, your application needs to be referred to the underwriter for further assessment to be transparent with you in regards to the low iron. And so we've noted down the whole situation. You explained it's all returned back to normal. So I have a quick review of everything and bring us and I'll come back very shortly. Great news is though, the heavy lifting now completed and finish all those hold and lifestyle questions for you.
[26 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK, perfect.
[26 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Uh, I also do need to advise that there has been a change that the premium has risen to $64.61 per fortnight. That was just to the BMI in the underwriting application. But the great news is now if we're able to get a fully approved application, so from the underwriters, if they fully approve it, Touchwood, if you want to have any complications to your whole or live lifestyle, if you want to develop any whole conditions, be Touchwood. Once you're approved, you're approved for life. So nothing will ever affect the original cover that you do organize the cover on. Umm, so yeah. So that's how that then works. Now it still needs to be sent through to the insurer for them to further assess. So what I'll do, I'll let you know a bit about the life insurance for yourself. I'll let you know what's going to be exactly covered if all fully approved. So firstly, it's immediate protection from the moment you do organize the policy. This policy will cover you for death to due to any cause, just accept the suicide in the 1st 13 months. So in that unfortunate case, that's we'll be paying that $750,000 directly to your beneficiaries.
[26 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : And then there's a living component as well. So it's a terminally ill advanced payment. If you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, we will pay the entire life insurance claim directly to you. It's designed to help you with the medical expenses, other expenses you may have at that time as well. Now for your family, they're also able to request an advance payout of $10,000. That's gonna help with more of those immediate kind of expenses such as the funeral calls on pay bills, things like that there as well. OK.
[28 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : OK, cool.
[28 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Now in terms of your cover, so please, please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means they will generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation which means each year benefit amounts will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. However, you can opt out of this indexation each year. Now also in terms for your current cover, I just need to advise. So if you are placing an existing policy, we recommend you to not cancel that policy until you have reviewed this policy in full as it may not be identical to your existing cover. So again, the Kelly great news is all the heavy liftings now completed. We've finished all those questions. So what I'll do for you now, since it is being referred, we can actually still get the whole process completed for you now. And what that looks like is we can link that up to a preferred payment method, reach your final declaration. Purposes of doing this is once we then get a final outcome for you, if it comes back fully approved, no changes, it really will be as simple as me giving you a quick call saying, hey, that's all been fully approved. With the Press of a button, we can put that policy immediately enforced from then on.
[29 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, cool. Am I able to reduce the amount to be worth from 7:50 just for that message increase?
[29 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yes, of course, of course it needs to be affordable.
[29 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK, what would 500,000 be?
[29 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : What would you like to look at 500,000? Just bear with me. I understand.
[29 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Just at the moment it's a little bit difficult because he's not paying anything, child support or anything.
[29 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : I understand what you're saying. It needs to be affordable again. And then in the future, you can apply to increase the amount up to the age of 70 years, subject to your eligibility at the time.
[29 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, perfect.
[29 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So it needs to be right for you at every moment. Let me grab that quote out. Just bear with me. So $500,000, it would be $46.73 per fortnight.
[30 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, OK, perfect.
[30 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : That sounds OK.
[30 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : We'll do that one.
[30 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, all quite bad. So to give you the heads up what happens from if the policy is all organised, we're going to get absolutely everything you need to know about your insurance all in writing for you.
[30 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[30 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So we send it to your e-mail up to the next 15 minutes time and then we'll send it to your home address as well within the next 5 to 10 working days. Has absolutely everything you need to know about your insurance. So you can then sit down, have a good read over it, make sure you're happy with it all as well.
[30 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK, correct.
[30 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I'll let you know as well there.
[30 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK, cool.
[30 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So while your application is being assessed, you will be covered for accidental death, which pays that if death was due to a direct result of an accident, cover under this loss until the insurer makes a decision on your application or 30 days from today, whichever is earlier, and the commencement of your cover, it will be subject to a final assessment by the insurer. So if the insurer offers cover without any alterations, so no changes anyway, or your application is unsuccessful, are you happy for me to record your acceptance of these outcomes now? And if you do get a bit too busy when I give you a call next, is it alright to leave you a voicemail to confirm the outcome?
[31 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yes, sure.
[31 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : No worries. In terms of linking it up, you do not need to make any payments upfront at all. How it works on our end is we generally collect the payment within the next 7 days. Within the next 7 days would be more suitable for you.
[31 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Wednesdays are good.
[31 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, so did you want to do next Wednesday?
[31 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[31 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, so it'll be the 7th of the 6th 2023 every four on the Wednesday, and then we're able to link this up through a direct debit. I'll just need to note down the account number. I'm more than happy to hold.
