[11 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : I just just was feeling straight and the doctor said you can try these if you want.
[11 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Let me explain that for you here, Richard. So what we mean by an episode? OK. So an episode is an event, occurrence or reoccurrence of symptoms with increased severity from normal mood and usually require either medical intervention, referral, treatment, or alteration, adjustment to existing maintenance treatment. Now treatment can take the form of either medication or counseling or therapy. So in terms of yourself, as you mentioned it, that was the form of medication.
[12 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, so we have 3 examples of how we capture the number of episodes for you. So for example, what if someone has mental health symptoms that require treatment? This is an episode, so that'll be captured as one episode, and if they return to their doctor several times to monitor the situation or for repeat prescriptions, this is the same single episode. They'll still be captured as just one. OK. Example 2. If, however, they have a relapse or symptoms worsen and treatment needs to be changed or increased, then this constitutes a second episode. And the third example is similarly, if the applicant recovers and treatment stops and the applicant is fine, but at a later date symptoms returned, I have to go back to the doctor to seek further advice. This would be a separate episode. OK, So to help you out in with OK, no problem at all.
[13 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Can I just ask a question? But you'll be looking at my medical records too, won't you?
[13 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So to go back to that question it's asking, yeah, no. So we go over this over the phone with you. That's what we do.

[13 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yes, yes, no, no, no.
[13 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : You'll just leave my doctor, OK?
[13 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So we just do it over the phone. OK, So to guide you through that, the right to help you out in terms of the medication that you had at the time, OK. And now you mentioned it only took before a period of time, which is no problem.
[14 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Ye. Yes. No. No.
[14 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Just to clarify was that medication did that at the time of taking it stayed con consistent like it didn't change or increased or stopped at any time we occurred, OK, no problem. So that'll be captured as one episode for you.
[14 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Thank you. Yes.
[14 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, so when answering the next question it's asking here, was it more than one episode? Yes or no? No problem.

[15 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : I suppose so.
[15 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So just going off what because you mentioned you, you had the medication that was given, right? So that was based on, they just mentioned it was depression and you said the doctor just said try these medications. Is that right? Yeah.

[41 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : She's all fixed now. She she's that.

[42 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : I, I, I, I OK yeah. Put, put tape. I can put tape. Yeah.

Yes or no?
[42 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[42 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Great to hear. So that's all the questions for you completed Sir. So thanks a lot for going through there with me and let's have a look at the results for you. All right, so the results have come back immediately and in this sense your health and life are answered. Your application needs to be referred to the Underwriter 4 assessment. Now that's only based off the the checkup done for the for the sleep apnea, OK?
[43 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK, I guess. Yep.
[43 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : That's the only reason why that's going to be just assessed, OK. Everything else that we will do in that won't be assessed is only that area. That's why we just ask a bit more questions in regards to that, OK. Now in regards to the policy itself, I'll go through what's included. So we cover you here for the three benefits as I mentioned earlier. Now please be with that your premium is stepped, which means you'll generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 5% with associated increase in premium. You can of course opt out of this indexation each year. So you're in control of that. Now with the first benefit is we cover you for this. Now, Richard, how it works with us is if for example, sorry if the application comes back from the underwriter and with no changes to the application, you will have no waiting period that you have to go through. You will be covered immediately for this due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK.
[44 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[44 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So that's providing you for the death benefit, you have a living benefit as well which is a terminally in advance payment, which means if you were diagnosed with 12 months left to live by medical practitioner, we can pay your claim out in full, OK? So that benefit is where you can be able to receive that whilst your life, OK? And that can be able to have that support for yourself towards medical expenses, treatment costs, etcetera. OK.
[45 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[45 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : We also provide here that when you pass away, your beneficiary can request an advanced payout of $10,000 to help with any fuel costs. OK.
[45 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[45 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So that's provided for you there. So these three benefits which are all included in the insurance policy for yourself, does that all make sense?
[45 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep, right. Yep, it does. Yeah.
[45 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[45 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Just one question there. Then if you say the beneficiary can ask for an advance payment of $10,000, how long do how long does it take to pay out to happen then?
[45 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Great question. So when they apply for their advanced part for the fuel expenses that's usually paid within one business day of all relevant documents been received to they're accounted for, OK.
[45 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep, OK, Yep. And and and then everything's all, all, everything goes through what, what is the normal time frame for a full payout?
[46 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Great question. So when for example your family makes a claim with us, right? So let's say they request the advanced payout and then that'll be advanced of 10,000. The remaining level of cover will be paid out to them after that once we receive like the relevant documents, for example, like the gift certificate, OK?
[46 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[46 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So with the funeral advance payout, that is where we can be able to receive like a copy of the death certificate, OK? We understand that the death certificate can only take some time. So when they do, then get the official death certificate and send that to us so that it will documents which it once you receive it, we'll then action that claim and pay that insurance out to your beneficiary in full. OK.
[46 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[46 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Good question. So there's no time frame on it based.
[46 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : It only takes one week, two weeks, 3 weeks sort of thing, yeah.
[47 minutes][Agent] : It's only depending on how fast your beneficiaries send that to us, right, Because they depending on obviously when they get it from the doctor. Do you know what I mean? Like, it's hard to say when that gets issued out, right? Depending on obviously your cause of death, depending on when they, yeah.
[47 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I that's OK, but it, but it normally gets paid out within Yeah, it it's not a long period, it's not long and drawn out. It's not. Is it normally paid out? Which is a month?
[47 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So good question.
[47 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Is everything done Is done information?
[47 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So for example, once you receive the relevance documents from your beneficiary, we action that immediately, OK? So that'll be paid out to your beneficiary's account once you receive the relevant documents from them, OK.
[47 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep.
[47 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So that process of actioning the claim doesn't take long that can be actioned on the same day once you receive it, right and then pay to your beneficiary. OK. So depending on also what type of bank they with will determine when that money goes to the account. Do you know what I mean?
[48 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Well, I just put it, it's relatively quick. Yeah, OK.
[48 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yes, we actually that immediately. So depending on how fast we receive the documents, right. But our our process from actually in the claim is immediately once we receive that documents from your family. OK.
[48 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep. I get.
[48 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Now in terms of the policy here, I do need to advise that the premium has risen and the reason for the change in the premium is basically family history, OK. So we'll have to change the the premium for you. Let me know. This is called suitable. So for the 1,000,000 that's $291.68 per fortnight. Is that still comfortable for you, Richard, or would you like me to adjust that for you? Yeah, it has changed.
[48 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : It's coming up $100, isn't it say 200 It, it hasn't changed.
[48 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : No, I said it has changed.
[49 minutes][Customer] : It has changed, yes.
[49 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[49 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : That's kind of a whole $100 I, I and that's even if and E even if I can prove that I haven't got any problems with my heart.
[49 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So, yeah. So like I said, that's not based on you, that's based on your family history, right. So your dad and sister?
[49 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep. But but if I could you get it down if I had a full medical showing that I had no problems.
[49 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So we already disclosed that. We already disclosed you have no problems in regards to your heart. You disclosed that already. Like that's what I'm saying. It's not based on you, it's based on your family history. That's right.
[49 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK, Right, OK, OK, OK, OK. So that's and it's just this one insurance that you competitively priced again with other providers.
[49 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah. Well, it all depends, right? There's differences amongst all insurances, umm, depending on what they offer in terms of the benefits, outcome of the insurance, right? So with us, based on what we offer and in terms of the outcome for you, that's what the premium has. Umm, is now, right?
[50 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Right then.
[50 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : But we can adjust, right? So if for example, we look at the 750,000, I can show you what that premium will look like for you.
[50 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, Right then. Yes, please.
[50 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Well, let's have a look at that for yourself. Let me build it up for you. OK, so I'll just update that for you. I'll bring up the cover for the 750,000 quote. All right, there we go. OK, so click back on. Alrighty, there we go. So if you look into the cloud, that's 750,000. That'll be now, umm, for the premium. OK, that's $215.01 per fortnight.
[51 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[51 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Say that again, sorry.
[51 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, we'll put it on for the million, put it, put my policy still for the 1,000,000.
[51 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem. So let's keep that the 1,000,000 for you. OK, great. Now I'll explain the process what we can do now.
[52 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : 1.
[52 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So while your application is being assessed, you will be covered for accidental death, which pays out if death was due to a direct result of an accident. Cover under this last until the insurer makes a decision on your application or 30 days from today, whichever it is earlier. So it's letting you know whilst they're assisted what we support you with. OK. Now the process, what we can do is we can get that organized for you here and send that over to our underwriter, OK? They'll get back to us with the result. Now the commencement of your cover will be subject to the to final assistance assessment by the insurer if the insurer approves cover without any changes.
