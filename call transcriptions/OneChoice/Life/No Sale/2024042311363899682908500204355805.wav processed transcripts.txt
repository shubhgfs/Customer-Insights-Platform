[20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, not bad. That's great. Not too bad. Thank you. Jason. I'm calling to follow up on an enquiry you've made with regards to our life insurance here at One Choice and to help with some pricey information. Show you how that all works for yourself there.
[33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, I've just done it. So yeah, I've got time.
[33 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep, beautiful. So I'll firstly start by confirming the information you provided us with. We'll have a look at some pricing and how it all fits together. So I am speaking with Miss Jason Gomez. Is that how you say it?
[53 seconds][Customer] : Games.
[52 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, Gooms. Sorry. OK, excellent.
[57 seconds][Customer] : No, no Gamez. That's not cool.
[57 seconds][Agent] : And, and your date of birth is the 7th of the 6th, 68.
[1 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : It is.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : And you are a New Zealand resident?
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : I hope so.
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Last time you checked, you were a New Zealand resident, weren't you?
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I am.
[1 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Excellent. All right, so, Jason, I'll let you know that calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is limited to products you offer and assist you to make a decision about whether they're suitable for your needs. We do not consider your personal circumstances. Now, Jason, have you currently got some life insurance in place, or is this something that's new to you?
[1 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No, I've only got more insurance.
[1 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : No, I want to go. OK. Yep. So you're looking for that bit extra cover, are you?
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, not for my partner, really.
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK. All right, we'll look here at one choice.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : And grandchildren.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Oh, you've got grandchildren as well. Oh, fantastic.
[1 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Oh, God, no, Kim.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : How many of you got, wow, OK, definitely, uh, busy times there.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : No, No, not for me. But anyway, before I draw that. No, it's just nothing from my no wash pot. Yeah, she's good.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep, certainly. And look, that's what our life insurance is designed to do. It gives you that Peace of Mind knowing if something was to happen and you passed away. But she does have that financial support in place to help maintain a lifestyle. OK, now not only that, without cover here at One Choice, it also allows your beneficiaries to request an advanced payout of $10,000 to help with any funeral costs, which is generally paid within the first 48 hours and received the completed documentation. So, yeah, Yeah. Oh, look, you know, that's great to see. It is available to be used however it's needed. But, you know, she doesn't need to claim for it. Like request it. That doesn't matter either. It's serious. It is needed. OK, so let's have a look at some pricing for you. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months, Jason?
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, but I've got funeral covered, so yes, I do smoke.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK. No judgement.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Cool.
[3 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So do I and umm is you can choose from $100,000 up to $1,000,000 to cover. How much are you looking at for yourself there?
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : No, you tell me, right?
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : We'll start at 100 and go to 500.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : All right. So if we're looking at the $100,000, that would be a fortnightly premium of $81.80 a fortnight, OK. If we're looking at the 500,000, that would be a fortnightly premium of $197.50 a fortnight. Which one sounds better? Or would you like a price for in between?
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : So was it at 80 for fortnight for 100 grand? Yeah. So it's 24 bucks a week? Yeah.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So the 100,000 is 5180 a fortnight, roughly, yeah. Yeah.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : How does that one sound for you? That'd be a good level of cover.
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : No, no, yeah. And what was the other one? So it's $100 a week, right?
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : If we went up to the $500,000, that was $197.50 a fortnight roughly, yeah. Yep.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : What if we go in the middle?
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : You can choose, yeah. OK. So if we went to say 250, that is a fortnightly premium of $106.44 a fortnight, yeah. So yeah, what level of sub cover sounds best for yourself? You can choose in $50,000 sets. We start from $100,000.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : $35 a week, Yeah, not really. It's not gonna really bother me as of because I only did.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. It's just a matter of finding out what to give you a piece of mind that your partner has that support, but also what's affordable for you.
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : No, it's all affordable to me.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Yeah. So would the $250,000 be the best one or?
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : You were the two. 5250 seems a good amount.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yep. And yeah. So it's quite enough, a lot there to help him maintain a lifestyle if he's got a mortgage or own or renting.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Not much. One. No, not much.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yes. OK. Yep. So that'd take care of the mortgage and leave some extra there for her to, you know, help support herself.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Easy.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK. Well look, that is an indicative figure. The final premiums in the terms of the policy is dependent on the outcome of your health and lifestyle application.

[20 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Don't blame that.
[20 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Anything, any I I've never blamed a shark. We shouldn't be stupid enough to go into their area. All right now. Umm, so Jason, with regards to your responses there, your application needs to be referred to our underwriters for assessment. That's just because the blood clot wasn't under our, umm, approved area now.
[21 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : No, that's just me being honest.
[21 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Oh, no, that's all right. No, that's no problems at all. And that's what we want for with our applications.
[21 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : But it was over three years ago too, so no. No, yeah.
[21 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so you, that's all right because you mentioned that it's just better to just, you know, I don't foresee any problems, but we just need to send that off to them to have a quick look at now. If approved, the policy will have you immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. And as well as that, there's a living benefit called a terminally ill advanced payments built in as part of the cover. And of course, it is something we hope that's never needed. But because we don't know what this future holds, it means that if you were diagnosed with four months or less to live by medical practitioner, we can actually pay the claim to you in full while you ask a living. Now I do. Yep, Yep. No, that's well, yeah. You can use it towards whatever you wanted to if that was the case, so that you know what you're and it can help with treatments or just, you know, is, you know, an assistance with maintaining the lifestyle there.
[21 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Right, 'cause I am self-employed that would that would cover it a holiday.
[22 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. You can take a trip, you can do whatever you want. You know, it is completely up to yourself.
[22 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Well, that's no, that's quite nice.
[22 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : As I said, hopefully it's never needed, but it said just in case. So. Yeah, Now I do need to advise that the premium is risen based on your occupation of working offshore for greater than 15 hours per week, per month.
[22 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : 10 hours a day?
[22 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Umm, And so for the $250,000 the fortnightly, yeah, well, yeah, that too. Umm, the the fortnightly premium has risen to $212.89 a fortnight for $250,000 a cover. How does that sound? Is that still affordable or would you like to look at a different amount?
[23 minutes][Customer] : No, I think we'll drop it to 100.
[23 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK, so let's drop it down to the $100,000 and we'll see what that does for you. OK, let me one moment. Sorry, my system is just going a little bit slow there. OK. So if we're looking at the $100,000, that is a fortnightly premium of $103.62 a fortnight, That one.
[23 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : It didn't get out much.
[23 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, Sorry.
[23 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : It didn't go down much.
[23 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I did. It's went down by about $100 or just over $100. It went down by yeah, OK.
[23 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Don't sit with that.
[23 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, roughly $50 a week. It is, yeah.
[23 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : That's like, OK.
[23 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK. Now please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it would generally increase each year. And in addition that this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. Now at the end of the day, this is your cover. You know it's best for yourself and your circumstances, so you can opt out of this indexation each year, but it is something we offer you on an annual basis so you have that control and flexibility. OK, now what the next step is, is, as I said, we need to send it off to our underwriters. Uh, So what I'll do is I'll click some payment details and read you a declaration so that I can get this assessed by the underwriter. Are you happy to proceed?
[24 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[24 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK. So while your application is being assessed should be covered for accidental death which pays out if death was due to a direct a direct result of an accident and cover under this glass until the insurer makes a decision on your application or 30 days from today, whichever is earlier. OK, now something like this, it should come back there pretty quickly now. So the commence the commencement of your cover will be subject to the final assessment by the insurer. If the insurer offers cover without any alterations. Are you and or your application is unsuccessful? Are you happy for me to record your acceptance of these outcomes now? And I'll leave a voicemail to confirm the outcome if I'm unable to reach you on the phone.
[25 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[25 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yep, alright, no problem. So as far as the payments, nothing will come out until such time as an the application, the policies put in place and umm, we generally collect payment within the next 7 days. So when in the next 7 days would be more suitable for you?
[25 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Oh, it doesn't matter.
