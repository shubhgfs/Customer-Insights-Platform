[1 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : I mean you can let me know how that sounds OK perfect. Now, umm with this life insurance, it's designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones. So a lump sum payment if you were to pass away, and basically it's there to give you the Peace of Mind that if something happened to your family would have that financial security. Now you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the benefit amount that you choose, and they can also request an advance payout of $10,000 to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. Now we keep it nice and simple for you as everything is done over the phone with no forms to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete. We simply just take you through health and lifestyle questions and this will determine the pricing in terms of the policy.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, cool.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So now we can get to that pricing for you. The first question is, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes, I have.

[2 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Current benefits, yes.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yes, OK, yeah, so, umm, for that then if you're not too sure, I can just put it down so that it's less than 50,000 and we can just work off that umm, because we would need you to, to know if it's over, umm, but we'll, we'll just put it down for less. And what that determines is just how much cover we can offer you at this stage. So umm, with that, umm answer, the lowest amount of cover we could provide you would be 100,000 and the highest we could look at would be 1,000,000.

[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So how much cover would you like me to to quote you for?
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Can I do the 1,000,000 please?

I'm going to put that down on all my notes here to say that they didn't give you an answer. Basically they were just kind of speculating as to what could happen as to what the answer could be.
[20 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[20 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Is that, is that right there that they were like they were just giving me theories kind of OK, OK. And I'm going to mention the gallbladder thing here as well because that's that's what I usually do anyway.
