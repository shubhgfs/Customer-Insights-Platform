[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Well, I saw my GP about right 2-2 weeks ago, so it would have been four weeks prior to seeing who.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So it would be 4 weeks prior to being good and the other GP adjusted it and then I had to re get reviews.

[4 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : And but yes, yeah.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So it was six weeks ago then in total of when you they increased it and now went back for a check up two weeks ago and then it was all clear, it was all normal.

[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes, yes, yeah, it's put it right back in. She said that that's what would that was probably why I was experiencing the busyness was because my blood pressure medication wasn't right.
