[3 seconds][Customer] : Hey Danielle, how are you?
[2 seconds][Agent] : Hi, good. How are you?
[6 seconds][Customer] : I'm very well, thank you. Alright, so this one's a bit of a umm, this is an interesting 1. So she's already, she already has a sorry, excuse me, umm, she already has a life policy, but she's on a joint cover. But what she's wanting to do is she's now wanting to separate it, but I let her know that she won't be able to separate it. She'll have to apply for her own stand alone cover.
[37 seconds][Agent] : Uh huh.
[32 seconds][Customer] : So once you finish setting that all up for her and if everything goes well and improve, uh, approved, umm, you need to send her back, umm, in the policy number that she's on with the joint cover and just explain to the support agent that you're sending her through to have her removed off from that policy as she's now just set up her and stand the line. Does that make sense, Danielle?
[55 seconds][Agent] : OK, so she's currently got joint life at the moment.
[58 seconds][Customer] : That's correct. And she's, and because she's wanting to separate it, but we can't, I mean, the only way that we can separate it is she applies for her own stand alone and then we can have her removed from the joint. The only reason why we're not going to remove her before, it's just that in case she doesn't get approved or something happens along those lines. So we're just going to do it this way. So once you're done, please don't forget to send it back to support so they can go through the removal of her on the joint policy.
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. OK. Just bear with me.
[1 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : So give me one second client.

Now I've got two final questions here for you. Now question number one, do you understand and agree with the declaration?
[36 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[36 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : I've just read you yes or no question #2 would you like any other information about the insurance now? Or would you like me to read any part of the policy document to you?
[36 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : No.
[36 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So I'm going to go ahead and accept that declaration. So that's the cover all set up and done for you. Now all you need to do once you receive those policy documents is fill out the second to last page, which is our beneficiary's form and post that one back to us. I'm going to pop you on a quick hold and transfer you through to customer support and they'll be able to help remove you off your joint policy. OK, perfect. I won't be too long.
