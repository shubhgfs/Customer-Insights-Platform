[7 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : I don't understand the question.
[7 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. All good. What I'll do, let me give you a definition for episodes that'll help to find it a little bit easier for you as well and bring that up for you. It's not what we want. There we go. Alright, So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna give read you the definition first thing and I'm gonna give you some examples of what's the same episode, what's a separate episode and then what's the subsequent episode as well.
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, so just so you've got the full picture, so let me just bring that up now. Good old technology. Well that works, it's great. There we are. Okey dokey, just being my friend again. Alright, so an episode is an event, occurrence or reoccurrence of symptoms with increase severity from normal mood and usually require either medical intervention, referral treatment or alteration slash adjustment to existing maintenance treatment. Now we keep when we say treatment this can take the form of medication and or counseling slash therapy as well. We consider that treatment also.
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : None.
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So some examples. So if someone has mental health symptoms that require treatment, this is an episode. And if they return to their doctor several times to monitor the situation and also repeat prescriptions, this is the same single episode. It doesn't change even if it's over like a five year. It doesn't actually matter. If, however, they have a relapse or symptoms worsen and treatment needs to be changed or increased, then this constitutes a second episode. And similarly, if the applicant recovers and treatment stops and the applicant is fine, but at a later date, the symptoms return and they have to go back to the doctor to seek further advice. This would also be a separate episode as well because that's how we break them up and define them there for you. So based on that, how many episodes would you say you've had?
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : OK, was in my last time probably. Yep.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Two, Yeah, no worries. And was it more than one episode? So we'll click yes.
[9 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Just medication, Yeah.
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : And then have you had symptoms or treatment for this condition within the last six months, this medication? Yep. All good. And have you ever seriously contemplated or attempted suicide? Thank you. All right. No further questions on that one. Thank you. The next question is have you been diagnosed with or currently undergoing testing for or has a doctor advised you to be tested for Moto neuron disease or any form of dementia including Alzheimer's disease?
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : The next section is in relation to your heights and weights. Please be aware that I am required to obtain a confidence single figure measurement for each sorry, single figure measurement each in order to continue with the application. The system does not allow me to enter any approximate figures, words or height weight ranges. So when you last checked, what is your exact height in centimeters or feet in inches 5/2 Thank you.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : So on five foot 2 inches, 115 kilos.
[10 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : And when you last checked, what is your exact weight in kilos, pounds or stones 115? Thank you. Awesome. Done and done. Taking no further questions off you and your application has been approved. OK. So I'm going to walk you through final terms, final pricing, everything like that. So if you've got any questions, I'll be able to answer them all now, now that we've got the compilation with all this all. OK, So what we've been able to approve you for is subject to the following terms and conditions. So we're able to offer you a benefit amount of the following 50,075 thousand or $100,000 of cover with a policy term of 20 years.
[11 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[11 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Now with this policy you'll be covered in those three ways I mentioned to you earlier, death, terminal illness and funeral cover. So for the death benefit for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death only and then after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause including anything pre-existing new conditions. Whatever it is doesn't matter from that point. However in touch with of course this never happens, but suicide is not covered in the 1st 13 months of the policy. So that's your death benefit. The second benefit as I mentioned earlier is the terminally ill advanced payment cover. So again, after holding your policy for 12 months if you were diagnosed with a terminal illness, so we've 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we then pay the full claim directly to you whilst you're living to give you full access. And then on top of all this, your loved ones will still be able to request the advanced pad of $10,000 to help with your funeral cost as well. That's all included there for you.
[12 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, alright.
[12 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, to help answer your question that you answered asked before we went through the application. I will let you know that please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year. And in addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amounts and how much you're actually covered for will increase by 2% with associated increases in premium. However, you can opt out of this indexation each year as well. OK. So it gives you control of that side of things. That way if you wanted to reduce your total increase, you just decline that each year as well. OK, Then it'll minimize that for you. Yeah. Terms of the final pricing for the, if you stick with $100,000 of cover, the final pricing has come back at $62.09 each fortnight for that cover. How's that sounding? That's OK.
[13 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Right, yes, but too much what we're wanting to do at the moment.
[13 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, for sure. We've got the 75 and the 50 available, so I can show you those and see if those would be a better fit. So if we do the 75,000, that's $46.57 a fortnight and then if you do the 50,000, it's $31.04 a fortnight.
[14 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK, well I'll have a think about that.
[14 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. Well, either of those other two looking a bit more suitable for you.
[14 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, possibly, but I'd like to get a few more quotes to see if I can get anything better than that.
[14 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. I definitely appreciate that. Whilst I've got you here as well, let me go through that premium projection with you just so you can see how it will work as well. So I'll let you know that please be aware that all of our premium projections are indicative only and assume that you do not make any amendments to your cover.
[14 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Got it.
[14 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So as an example, the premium payable in your following year of cover, this is for the $50,000 of cover. So it's 3104 at the moment. In the following year of cover will be $33.25 per fortnight. And then your new coverage amount would be also the 51,000 because it goes up by that 2% when you're 57 years of age. So in your second year of cover, third year of cover, I should say it'd be $35.61 per fortnight and it'll be $52.20, sorry, 52,000 and $20 in total coverage. And then the year following that will be $38.13 per fortnight and your total coverage amount will be 53,000 and $60.00. OK.
[15 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[15 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : So that's just so you can have a little indication there. We've tried to minimize it as much as possible for this policy. There is still an increase to be aware of as well, but we try to keep it nice and consistent as you can see. Yeah.
[15 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK. Lovely.
[15 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : All right, so Nikki, what I'm going to do for you, I'm going to send you out the the quotes to your e-mail now.
[15 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[15 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So I've got it here as Nikki Princess, that extra code or NZ, is that the best e-mail?
[15 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's fine.
[15 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, fantastic. Now with those ones that were you wanting me to send out both or just the 50 or the 75 on one of that too?
[15 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, the 50 and 75. Yeah.
[15 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Both of them, yeah, absolutely fine.
[15 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[15 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Alright, let me get those both out to you as well. Now I'm going away for some leave from this evening, so I finish up at 8:00 tonight. So feel free to give me a call back tonight. If not, I'll be back on the 10th, so I'll reach out to you when I get back into the office. The 10th is a Thursday. On Thursday is what time are you normally best available?
[16 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, probably 4:00.
[16 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : 4:00? OK, Let me just have a look at my schedule, OK, What I'm gonna do in that case, I'll give you a call at 4:00 on the Friday if that's OK. I do finish up a little bit early on Thursdays, not anything.
[16 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll be driving at that time, so fine.
[16 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So unless you can do maybe 3:30, if that would work on on the Thursday driving, that's that's fine.
[16 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : It'll be fine.
[16 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : All good, all good.
[16 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[16 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Alright, let's let's move it to Friday at 4:00 and if that's alright with you, umm, that way if you just got that time and we'll go from there. If you need anything though, in the meantime, even though I'm not here, everything's basically been done for you. OK, So all that we need to do is basically decide on the amounts that you're wanting to go with and then they'll ask you what payment day you wanted on and then payment method as well. So it's pretty straightforward from here on out. Umm, So it's all good to go when you're ready. So even if I'm not here, just call back in and let us know. We can get that sorted as well. OK.
[17 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[17 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[17 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Thank you very much.
[17 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : No, My absolute pleasure. Thank you so much for your time. I'll speak to you when I'm back.
