[12 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Oh OK.
[12 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Umm, some, some illness. There was four different ones.
[12 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Oh OK. So what we could do is within that pre activation policy, if you do decide to set that up, you'd you'd, you'd be covered for more than just accidents. So for the 1st 12 months you'll be covered for accident to death only. But then after 12 months in the policy, you'll be covered for death due to any cause, of course, except suicide is not covered in the 1st 13 months of the policy. OK.
