[5 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so we have to be individual policies for for each of them. Yeah, yeah. So umm, so for the 1st for Tiana, for the 1st 12 months, you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only after the first 12 months, you'll be covered for death due to any cause. In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we pay your benefit amount to you in full.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : And regarding the premium, so you can choose between a minimum of $3000 and a maximum of $30,000 of cover. So how much cover would you like me to quote you for?

[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, So we can do 12,000, so $12,000 of funeral cover, you'd be looking at a fortnightly premium of $10.45.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : That's fine.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, and that's per fortnight. OK, thanks. Now for your premiums, your premiums are level, which means they're designed to stay consistent year on year. And when you reach the age of 85, your premiums will cease, which means you will stop paying premiums and a 25% bonus cover will be automatically added to your benefit amount. Also, at any time after your 85th birthday, you will have an early cash out option where you can choose to end your cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. OK, now for this question. Can I please confirm you're authorized to disclose this? No, sorry. Can I please confirm you're authorized to purchase this policy on behalf of the insured?
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, thank you.

[7 minutes][Agent] : All right, now you may OK, thank you.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : And you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back.
