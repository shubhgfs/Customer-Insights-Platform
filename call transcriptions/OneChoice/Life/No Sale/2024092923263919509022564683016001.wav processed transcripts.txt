However, excluding employer, Kiwi saver and super contributions. Umm So what is your pre annual tax income?
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : So it's my hours are, I believe it's about 61,200 and something, but it's it's probably easy to just work it out of my hours.

[6 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Cool. Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Umm, OK, perfect. Now, uh, based on your duties and income, you can select the monthly benefit amount from $1000 up to a maximum of 3867. Uh, what amount would you like me to select for you?
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Is this per month? Did you say?
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Uh, yes. So this is like a monthly benefit that we pay for you.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : So this will be so. So this is my claim amount essentially. Is that what you mean?
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so at the time of yeah, so if we were paying this, this is like an amount that we'd pay for you per month if you were unable to work, it'd be something that we could provide for you monthly.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, sure. So and did you say that's it can go up to 75% of my wage? Because that's not that's the larger amount is above 75%, isn't it? I'm just trying to work out.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so this one is up to uh, so I, it's, it's automatically calculated in the system. Umm, so it would be up to 75% of your monthly pre tax income.
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So the maximum amount would be 3867 per month.
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, sure, OK yeah, may as well be at the hyper end.

[7 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : I guess that's that's about what I earn anyway, isn't it?
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah, no worries. That's OK. We can select that. Now you also have the option to select different waiting periods and, uh, benefit. So I'll explain what, uh, what that is. So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit starts like before it starts being paid to you after the insured event. And you can either choose 30 days or, uh, 90 days. So which one would you like me to select?
[7 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : So Yep, sure, probably 50 days.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. Now next is the benefit. Umm, and what that is, is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness.

[20 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : As far as I can remember, mate. Yeah. It was just just my fun.
[20 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. That's OK. Then we can leave it as just that one for now. Uh, next, uh, one on the, uh, one is just about family history in these next two.
[20 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, sure.
[20 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Umm, And by immediate family in the questions, it's referring to your father, mother, brother or sister only. So, to the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family, living or deceased, ever been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, Huntington's disease, or Familial adenomatous polyposis? And to the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family suffered from cancer, heart condition, stroke, or other hereditary disease before the age of 60?
[20 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[21 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Alright, wonderful. Now, uh, just the next question here is just in regards to what we call hazardous pursuits. All it asks is other than one of events like maybe if you had a gift certificate or a voucher, do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fare paying passenger on a recognized airline, motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, AB sailing, scuba diving deeper than 40 meters, cable rack diving or any other hazardous activity?
[21 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No.
[21 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Alright, wonderful. Now, thank you so much for your answers there. The next step is just to go through, uh, the, uh, just to go through the final pricing in terms of the policy there for you. So congratulations, your application has been approved for that life cover as well. Uh, now I, I, it's approved with the following terms. So it's regards to the second occupation that we disclosed there for you. Umm, I, what it just says is based on that entity you provided, this is just the following exclusion. It just says we will not pay an income benefit in respect of a claim for a disabling sickness or injury occurring directly or indirectly from the insured performing the duties of the second occupation. Any income derived from the second occupation will not be eligible to be included as final evidence for your pre disability income. Umm, now the next section there is just in about said the back disorder that you had with surgery. Umm, what it just says There's no benefit will be payable for any disability, condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to or arising from the spine, including its inter vertebral discs, nerve roots, supporting musculature or ligaments. But that's the only two changes that were made as of the application through that as well.
[22 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[23 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Now with that, umm, for the amount of the maximum monthly benefit that we selected for you, which was the $3867.00 with the waiting period of 30 days and the benefit period of two years, the final pricing, therefore you would be $62.78 per fortnight. And that's the approved amount there for you.
[23 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Not sure this is the first amount I've got, so I don't really know what it's worth to be honest, but what? What was a 62? What? Sorry.
[23 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but how did that sound $6062.78 a fortune?
[23 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : 3051 a week.
[23 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Umm, So maybe in case you do your budgeting weekly, that's $31.39 per week.
[23 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK. Yeah, no, I guess that's fine.
[23 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, now.
[23 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. I'm just wondering about that spine cover because I mean, if it's a new injury to my spine, then how is that related to my old injury?
[24 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So it's just, it's just in regards to any, anything in regards to to, to the spine or, or to the to the sections that I listed down before. And it's only just based on the fact that you would have the back disorder in the past with the surgery as well, outside of those two things that I mentioned.
[24 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : You know, like is it that that was, that was an injury though? It's, it's not a disorder. It was an injury that was operated on and corrected. So there's no disorder there. It's just, yeah, so does that. So, So what you're saying is I'm I'm not covered for anything to do with my entire spine or you're saying that I'm not covered for anything that relates to that old injury is that I don't understand? Yes.
[24 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So, so it's the only reason why we that spats in there is in regards to the old injury that you would had. So what it's what it's saying is that it's not payable for any disability, condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complication related to or arising to the spine, including the inter vertebral discs, nerve roots, supporting musculature or ligaments.
[25 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : So sorry.
[25 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Not, not related to the old injury, but not not just related to the old injury, but anything that could happen from here on outwards.
[25 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : So is that specifically just related to mild injury or is that my entire spine, right to my entire back, my entire spine?
[25 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yes, yes, yes.
[25 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : That seems odd considering. I mean, obviously it's not likely to happen, but if it does happen then, well, you know, I'm not covered for it, so.
[25 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, that's definitely fair. It's just with the with, since it's mainly designed to look after your income, if you were to suffer the disabling illness or injury, anything that happens prior to you taking at the policy increases the risk of it happening at a later time, which is why that exclusion's just included in there. Umm, of course, you know, since it's, you know, there was surgery.
[25 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : I don't think so.
[25 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : It's good to hear.
[25 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : I mean like it's I could have a completely new injury to my spine. It's not related to my old injury at all. There's nothing. Just because it's my spine doesn't mean it's related to my old injury.
[26 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, which is completely fair. I I definitely get where you're coming from. It's just based on the application. It's just a risk assessment that we do based on that. Outside of that though, we can still cover for injuries outside of that as well. And to any other area. Of course, hopefully nothing W would happen, but it's something we can still look after you. If, if that was to happen, umm, would you be happy with it though, even though that's in there? Like, would you be happy with it? Something that can cover you for that.
[26 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : I'm not sure to be honest. I think I need a little more clarification on that simply because it's yeah, I just don't, I don't feel like that's yeah to not cover me for anything to do with my back. I mean, you know, that's like I got operated on over a decade ago and I've had no issues since.
[26 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK.
[26 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : So umm, so why I wouldn't be covered for my entire spot?
[26 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : No, that's yeah.
[26 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : And seems a bit odd to be to be honest, but uh.
[27 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK. Well, I mean, look, I can, I can definitely understand what you mean. If it's something that you're not satisfied with this outcome or maybe you believe the information you've relied relied on is incorrect, you can we can definitely review the decision or I can escalate this as a as a complaint for you as well as something that we can escalate.
[27 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think I just need more clarification on it, to be honest. And yeah, because I mean, I would, I'd want to be covered for a spinal injury, a new spinal injury.
[27 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[27 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : I understand if I'm not covered for anything that arises from my old injury, which was well over a decade ago, that's fine, that's understandable. I get that. But why I'm not covered because what you know, what if it's my neck, nowhere near my lower back, but it's a new injury. So how that has anything to do with mild injury and why I shouldn't be covered for that doesn't really make any sense to me.
[27 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[27 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : So are we, are we able to get some more clarification on that or review the OK?
[28 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. I can definitely take you through the review and escalation process. So let me just see here.
[28 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[28 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Umm, OK, let me just see here. MMM, OK, no worries. That's OK. So would you, so would you want us to treat this as maybe a complaint or just like to review it and escalate it to our internal underwriting team for special consideration?
[28 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, probably not that.
[28 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[28 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : That's just special consideration. I'm not not complaining. I just want to know.
[28 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that's too bad.
[28 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I just want more clarification on that.
[28 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, no worries. Let me just put you on a brief hold. I'll just work out.
[28 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : So maybe the wording needs to be changed. I don't know, you know?
[28 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, alright, no worries. Well, let me just put you on a brief hold. I'll, I'll, I'll just, uh, find out which way I can do this for you and I'll just give one line me as well.
[28 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Comment sweetheart.
[30 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Hi, thanks so much for holding. So I'll just be able to e-mail our internal underwriting team as well.

[31 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[30 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, let me just, sorry, I just needed to note that one down and even that, but what I'll be able to do with regards to the exclusion that we touched on, I'll be able to e-mail our internal underwriting team as well, umm, to, uh, let them know just for further clarification on their end as well. Umm, I'll just bring up that section there under the H1. Sorry. Umm, OK, let me just load this up. OK, OK, let me look this up here. Sorry, it's just taking some time.
[31 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No trouble, man. Yep.

Now, if approved, this policy covers, uh, uh, sorry, let me just see here. Umm, now, uh, what I'll do is I'll just note down the also the escalation that we'll do for you where I'll just e-mail our underwriting team and then that way I can refer your application to them that we've got so far. And also I'll ask them for further clarification in regards to the, uh, back exclusion that I provided for you before.
[33 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that's correct.

[33 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, yeah.
[33 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So umm, umm. So, uh, what would you like me to note down under that one for you?
[34 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Umm, well, the, the operation was well over a decade ago and it was on my L4 disc. Umm, I understand if anything, any complications arise on my L4 disc umm, you know that I wouldn't be covered for that, but I would like to be covered if I was to say get a, a new spinal injury. Umm, you know, there's nothing wrong with the rest of my back. It's just that L4 disc.
[34 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Hmm, OK.
[34 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : So do you, do you understand what I mean? Or.
[34 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Prior, yeah yeah, definitely, definitely. I I get what you mean. So I'm not being covered in regards to prior injury.
[34 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. I was like every decade ago. It would have been. It would have been like 14 years ago, yeah.
[34 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Umm, uh, sorry, the operation being a decade ago, which was successful on L4 disc yeah OK, so 2010 umm, and you understand it's not being covered for prior injury, however, would like to uh, be uh, to have consideration for a new injury on the rest of his back.

[35 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Umm, Now just again, Please note that if the application is successful, umm, that the policy will not begin until you agree to be covered. But I'll reach back out and I'll give you a call to provide you an update on both of those as well. OK.

Or I mean, you said I was already able to get that policy, so I'm happy to start that policy that you said with that exclusion. But yeah, I would like to just, as I said, get clarification on why I'm not going to the rest of my back, if that makes sense to if we can have a yard about the guys or whatever.
