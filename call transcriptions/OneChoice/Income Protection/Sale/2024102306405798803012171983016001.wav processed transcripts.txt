[2 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Good, good. Thank you for asking. So my colleague mentioned you wanted to cancel your life insurance policy.
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because you have, uh, replaced that with the incompression 1.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : All right, I'm just going to bring up the scripts now. Uh, so we can cancel this policy. Uh, I'll place you on a brief hold. Might take more than two minutes, won't be long, and then we can cancel the policy straight away.
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK. Thank you.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, thanks. Thank you so much for your patience, Mark. Yep. So I'll go through some umm, policy details like the cancellation with you and then we can cancel this policy. So please be advised that by changing policies, you're commencing a new insurance policy, which means you will no longer be entitled to any benefits you accrued under your old policy. It's important to keep in mind that any errors or omissions when completing your new application can impact the claim. Waiting periods will apply from your new acceptance date. Umm, do you understand this and wish to proceed? OK, so I just need to confirm the following. We have agreed to waive the requirements under your policy to put your cancellation in writing and by agreeing to this declaration you acknowledge that your instruction to cancel your policy is immediate, final and non reversible. Your policy end date is so you wish to cancel it from today. Is that correct? Yep. So your policy end date is 23rd of October 2024. So after this date, you will no longer be covered under the one choice life insurance policy. Is that a yes?
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK. And can you please confirm that you agree with this declaration and instruct me to cancel your policy? All right, so I'll send you a letter of confirmation. Umm, and you should receive that within seven business days that your life insurance policy has been canceled, but we'll send you new documents for your income protection policy as well.
[5 minutes][Customer] : Yes, alright, thank you.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : All right, you're welcome. Is there anything else? Do you have any further questions?
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : My wife needs insurance.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : She wants to take out a Li policy. OK, What type of policy does she want to take? Sorry.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Maybe I call you guys back tomorrow.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, That's fine. That's fine. Not a problem. Alright then.
