[1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Alright, perfect. Thank you so much for that. Have you ever looked into income protection cover before?
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No, I have not. So yeah, I was hoping to get there and have a look at that.
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : It's OK, Yeah, no worries. Well, what our income protection cover is designed to do is to provide a monthly income benefit paid directly to yourself if you are unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. So it's designed to help cover your bills and living costs if your salary is interrupted.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : You can apply if you work at least 15 hours per week in paid employment. We offer an income benefit of up to 75% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. And would you keep everything nice and simple as everything is is done over the phone so there's no forms to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete. We simply take you to your health and lifestyle questions as this will determine the pricing and terms of the policy. So is there anything in particular that you were looking at covering what the monthly benefit if you are unable to work in your claim on the policy, for example, like is it primarily just for like your living expenses or do you have like some other things that you might want to cover?
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Uh, pretty much just yeah.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. Any mortgage repayments?
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Living expenses, so no.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. Uh, yeah, for sure. Well, we can definitely have a look at that for you, uh, with our, uh, income protection cover. It will cover you up until your Pol up until the policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Umm, and keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the policy document. Also keep in mind that premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible depending on the policy structure which could make it even more Co costly active for you. So it might be something worth having a chat to your tax professional to find out about. So I've just got some questions regarding your duties at work. Now before answering any of our questions it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your cover at claims time. So first of all, do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Sure I do.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment?

[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, I don't carry a firearm, man.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yes, a yes or no is fine.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : That's that's more global infrastructure.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. Yeah, just a yes or will be fine. Sorry, I just didn't hear what you said before whether it was a yes or no just because the phone was a bit funny. So was it a yes or no for this question? Sorry. Perfect, thank you for that. Alright, so another thing as well, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yep, no worries. And are you currently employed or self-employed?
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : That was no, he's employed.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK perfect. So I'll D I'll give you the definition of pre tax income to help determine how much cover we can offer you. So for someone who's employed, pre tax income is the total annual remuneration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses. However excluding employer, Kiwi saver and super contributions. So currently what is your annual pre tax income? Yeah, sure. So I'll put $90,000 for you, is that correct?
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : About 90,000, yeah, Yep.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Perfect. So based on your duties and income, I can I can quote you on a monthly benefit amount from $1000 up to a maximum benefit amount of $5625.00. So what amount would you like me to quote you on?
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Is it for the month?
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, this is the monthly benefit amount.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Are you saying we'll go the five 625?
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure, no worries. And you've also got the option to select different waiting periods and benefit periods depending on your circumstances. So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Which waiting period would you like me to select?
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : 90 days is fine.
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Sure, no worries. And for the benefit. This is the maxi.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Oh sorry, can we go back? Sorry, can we go to 30 days?
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : That's OK, No worries. And the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So you can choose six months, one year, two years or five years. Which benefit. Would you like me to select?
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, that's five years, eh?
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Five years, OK, no worries. So obviously the more, the higher the benefit. The more expensive it is going to be. So, and by the way, it is per it's per injury or illness as well. So if you've got two, OK, so let's say you've got like an injury that that happens that you claim on and then you've got an illness that you've claimed on. It'll be five years for each one individually, by the way. So are you still cool with the five years or do you want to look at something lower just to keep your premiums a bit lower? It's up to you.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : I'll go lower.
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. So we got six months, one year, two years or five years. So if you were to be off work due to injury or illness, what do you think the sort of like maximum amount of time out of those options you would need to be covered for would be per like per condition, for example?
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I'll just go one year.
[8 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, sure. No worries. OK, so let me just load that up for you. I just thought I'd let you know so it just so it wasn't too expensive as well, just so you're not paying any more than you need to sort of thing.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : And then also that's all right, because I know sometimes, like sometimes people might think that it's like the five years is for like all conditions included, like five years across all, you know, possible conditions. So I just wanted to sort of clarify just to make sure, but I'll take you through the health and lifestyle questions to confirm what the final cost is gonna be and also to determine what the what the terms are that we can insure you under as well.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So I'm just going to reach that's alright. I'm just going to read you out a pre underwriting disclosure statement before we go through that. So it just says here.

[23 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So the OK, the question that we're up to, I'm just going back to now. So I'm just trying to get back to the page you're on. OK, so it says other than what you've already told me about. In the past three years, have you sought medical advice or treatment by a medical practitioner or specialist? Or are you awaiting results for any medical tests or investigations such as but not limited to any surgeries, X-rays scans, blood tests or biopsy? Again, this is other than what you've already told me about. So not including, you know, what you've already told me about.

Perfect. Thank you for that. Alright, what did you love? I'm just loading up the results for you now.
[26 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : No, thank you.
[26 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : That's alright. OK, All right, awesome. Well, look, congratulations, your application is approved for the below TER with the low terms. So we're looking at a maximum benefit amount and benefit. So $5000 in two years respectively. And that's due to cancer or leukaemia. So we can look at a maximum of $5000 for the monthly benefit amount and a maximum of two years for the benefit. Maximum benefit. So there is an exclusion here for cancer or leukemia. So again, like we spoke about, no benefit will be payable for any disability, condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to or arising from cancer. And there is a premium adjustment due to cancer or leukemia, which I'll give you the the quote for in just a second there. So if we look at a a monthly benefit amount of $5000, a waiting period of 30 days and a benefit period of one year, you would be looking at a fortnightly payment of $87.91 per fortnight. So again, that's $87.91 a fortnight. How is that sounding so far for you?
[27 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Fortnight. Yeah, that'll be fine.
[27 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Alright, awesome. And that will, that's going to be affordable for you as well.
[27 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[27 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. All right. Awesome. Well, I know that you do have some life insurance with us. So what we'll do is we'll get this one covered over the phone today for you. So you can have that income protection cover as well. And you don't have to pay anything upfront to us. So how it works is that we generally collect payment within the next 7 days, but we do send out all of your documentation shortly after we set this up today. And this policy does give you a 30 day cooling off. So if you decide that the policy isn't suitable for you and you apply, try to cancel within 30 days of your first payment. Then you'll get a full refund of your premium unless a claim has been made. Now your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age.
[28 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[28 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : In addition, this policy has automatic indexation. So what that means is each year your sum insured will increase by 3% until you reach the maximum benefit of $15,000 per month with associated increases in premium. You can opt out of this automatic indexation each year. And another thing as well is that I want to let you know that included in your policy is a rehabilitation benefit which can assist you to return to work, which you can have a read of and in your your policy documentation once we set this up as well. So for the next part, when would you prefer the first payment to come out?
[29 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : So I get paid on a Tuesday evening. Where are we? So it's on the 11th. Which way to get paid up?
[29 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yep, on the 7th, yeah. OK. So we do generally collect payment quite early on in the morning. Do you want to do the 8th instead? Just to be sure?
[29 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK, the eighth will be fine. Yep.
[29 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. So I have the first payment come out on the eighth of the 1st, and then every fortnight thereafter on a Wednesday will be your other payment collection dates. When do you want the first paym? Oh, sorry, WH where do you want the payment to come out of? Do you want to note down a bank account or a card?
[29 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : I'll do a bank account, that'll be fine.
