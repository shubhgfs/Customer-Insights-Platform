Can I have you confirm your first and last name and date of birth there, please?
[23 seconds][Customer] : Why does your number come up? I suspected spam.
[26 seconds][Agent] : Oh, goodness. OK, no worries. I can tell you the, for a reason it's probably doing that is because you, I presume you have a Samsung or an Android phone, is that correct?
[35 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. I'm not too sure why. And seems that only be happening with our Samsung and Android clients. Umm, I think it's just the way that they kind of, umm, gauge those ones. If it's an unknown number, it can, you know, fall into that category, uh, just as a warning, you know, But umm, yeah, the only reason for my call is in regards to your inquiry to, to try and help you out with that one.

[1 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful.
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : And then also confirming that you are of course, a New Zealand resident currently residing in New Zealand. Yes or no?
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful. So Please note, all calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is limited to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they are suitable for your needs. We do not consider your personal circumstances. Alright, so I know you're having a look at both the income protection and also the life insurance cover there for yourself. What I'll do just because it's a little bit more involved, the income protection, I'll start with that one because some of the questions that we go for for life insurance will be the same. So just say just doubling up on things as well. Umm, so with this one here, do you currently have like income protection in place or first time you're looking at both these covers? Yep. OK, perfect.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep, this is the first time I make it again to have income collection in place, but I do have life insurance with another rider at this point, yeah.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. No worries.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm. Yep.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Just with that existing cover, I'd need to let you know that if you are replacing an existing policy with this cover, we recommend that you do not cancel it until you have received and reviewed our policy in full, as it may not be able to go to your existing cover. Just have to advise you about it. So that's totally fine. We can discuss that in good time there as well. Now income protection, I'll be honest with you, it's pretty straightforward. You know, it's one of those things where it's like we think it's a very, very daunting process. It's very, very simple.
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK. Mm hmm.
[2 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : The main premise with it is that if you are unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury or you suffer a loss of income, OK, and you suffer a loss of income, I should say this is basically designed to help out with those costs. All right, So what we do is we pay up to 75% of your monthly pre tax income.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So that ranges from $1000 as the minimum cover and then up to a maximum of $15,000 in total.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that's a range cover you'll be able to select from again, it'll also then be based on your monthly or annual pre tax income as well. Now very simple to get the coverage in place. You don't have to go through, you know the medical blood tests, visits to the doctors or anything like that.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : We do it all over the phone, same as our life insurance, just yes or no questions done over the phone. So really, really simple. Now once the coverage in place, you will be so cover, we will cover you up to your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday, OK? So that's the length of the cover there. And then keep in mind that there are some exclusions that are that apply as outlined in the policy documents as well.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So I'm going to go through a couple of quick questions just to do basically a duty space assessment to give us some initial pricing and then we'll go through the rest of the questions once we've gone through and have our starting point as well. OK.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm. OK.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So first and foremost, let me bring this up here. That's all done. All right. So before we go through these initial questions, I'll just advise that before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your cover at claims time. OK, just so you're at that one as well. So the first question we need to confirm is do you work 15 hours or more per week? Wonderful, Thank you very much. And is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment, yes or no?
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that is 7.5 hours, no worries. Yes.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much. Are you required to perform any physical duties?
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : No.

[5 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Fair enough. Nice and easy there. All right, let's that all done all righty. And the next thing I need to confirm is have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Perfect. All right, next question is are you currently employed or self-employed?
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm employee.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Employed. Thank you. Now when we talk about your pre tax income, pre tax income is the total annual remuneration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : However, excluding employer, Kiwi Saver and super contributions, OK, so excluding those two things there.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : And you're opening the day here, right?
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So what is your monthly, sorry, your annual pre tax income, Yes, over the year, correct.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Oh dear. Hang on.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Take your time. All good. Take your time.
[6 minutes][Customer] : Let me just go into my payroll really quickly because I think, sorry, I should have kept this really because I've.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : No, no, no, that's all good. I apologize.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : So I can give you correct amount.
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course.
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Oh my God, why is it I, I can give you a more detailed question.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Is with your with your pay, is it like consistent from, you know, month to month for fortnight, fortnight, week to week? Have you get paid? Yeah. Do you know what it is?
[7 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, my next pay, wait, it's, I mean posted deduction, I get about $2248, 228. Yep, $2980.39. So that's both 90.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Pre tax before tax $0.39 and how often is that being paid fortnightly? OK. So that works out to be pre tax $77,490.14. OK.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Oh, perfect. Thank you.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So we'll use that part with so it's consistent, it's not gonna change, right. So that's the whole point.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : There we go. Pop that in there, we are 77490.1 off. Just save it as I'll remove this cents. That's why. There we go. Alrighty, So in terms of the monthly benefit amounts, OK, so this is what would be paid if the disabling sickness on due was occurring. OK, what would you pay each month? Your range of cover will start at a minimum of $1000 as we said, and then based on your information so far, a maximum monthly benefit amount of $4842.00.
[8 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So you've got that range to look at. How much were you thinking? 4-5 yeah, easy, let's do that.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Because I think I was thinking about 4500, yeah.
[9 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Now there's two other things we need to decide on as well. It doesn't need to be a firm decision, but just to keep you kind of initial starting point, you've got a waiting period and then a benefit. So the waiting period is a non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable. After the insurance. You can choose 30 days or 90 days.
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[9 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Which waiting period would you like me to select? 30 days. Thank you.
[9 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : I think 30 days, yeah.
[9 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And then benefit. Is 6 months, one year, two years or five years. And that's the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. Oh, goodness. Of course, yeah.
[9 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Oh my God, I hope I don't have an injury that lasted five years, but I am just start. What were the timeframes that you had?
[10 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So it's six months, one year, two years or five years.
[10 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, I mean like what would people U What do people usually take? I I don't know.
[10 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : It's I guess what it really comes down to is what your current situation looks like and what it's going to look like in the future as well. You know, so we've got to consider how much leave you've got in place. OK. And any other kind of, you know, sources of income that you have at the time as well. And, and kind of what your occupation, you know, how involved you have to be with your occupation. You know, like if you have a disabling kind of, you know, let's say there's a disability for a client, but they do an office job and they're still able to, you know, type on the keyboard and still work if they're just in a wheelchair, for example, umm, you know, so you know, X amount of months, whatever it is, you've got to consider that as well. You know how easy it is to get back into your occupation, uh, in your role, umm, and, and things like that, whereas someone's works in construction, for example. So that'd be different because you've got to be active during that, during that job. So, umm, it's, it's one of these things you've got to look at your specific situation and I think, OK, you know, what's the best kind of course of action? It's always hard. You know, it's never an easy kind of decision, but you've got to look at what what would work for you I guess as well.
[11 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : I know, OK, we'll go with two years at this stage because the kind of work I do, I just need to sit at my desk and review claims, you know? Sure.
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, of course, of course. Let's have a look at that. All right. And as I said, we'll come back to all this at the end once you've actually gone through the full application and I've got the final pricing as well. So you don't have to make a final this year. It just gives us a good starting point. That way you can see where we're kind of roughly looking at to start with. So with everything we've just gone through based on that information there, fortnightly premium of $53.61 per fortnight, it's every two weeks.
[11 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 505361.
[12 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's it, correct. Yes.
[12 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[12 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So that's the four and a half, $1000 monthly benefit amounts, 30 day waiting period and then two year, 2 year benefit. As well.
[12 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : MM. Hmm.
[12 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, excellent.

[29 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So what that means is the pricing that we went through earlier, so $53.61 a fortnight for the four and a half, $1000 monthly benefit, 30 day waiting period to your benefit period to remain the same. No change to that one at all, OK. So we can definitely offer you that cover. So that's all good to go on that one.
[29 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[29 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Now I also wanted to let you know that the policy that you have with us will the income protection will include a re rehabilitation benefit which can assist you to return to work. OK.

[29 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Now the rehabilitation benefit which pays an additional reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit to a maximum of $3000 to help with rehabilitation costs whilst claiming or we can reimburse up to six times your income benefit towards cost of equipment or modifications required to assist you to return to work as well. OK. So, but that's included with your cover as well. Of course, your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year also. But yeah, everything's basically good to go. So as I said, really, really nice and easy, straightforward kind of situation there with that one. Just want to show you the life insurance quickly. So if we're going to do that as well. If not, we can get that in car protection sorted nice and quickly there for you. How much life cover were we thinking before wanting to switch?
[30 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : I was thinking maybe around 550.
[30 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : 550 OK, I'll bring that up for you. Just reconfirming, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no, Thank you. And at the moment, is your current annual income $50,000 or more? Yes or no?
[30 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, No, yes.
[31 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much. All right, so with the life insurance cover, very simple policy as well, three benefits included a death cover.
[31 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[31 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So to pay the full claim to your loved ones when you pass a terminally ill advanced payment cover, where if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we pay the full claim directly to you whilst you're living. And then there's also an advanced payout for funeral costs as well, where your loved ones can request an advanced payout of $10,000 to help with those initial funeral costs. So all that is including the one policy for the life insurance as well. All right, looking at $550,000 of cover would be $49.01 each fortnight. OK, so I'll give you the total price as well, just to help you out.
[31 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[31 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : It's 4901 + 5361, so totals to $102.62 a fortnight. That's for the income protection and then also the life insurance as well.
