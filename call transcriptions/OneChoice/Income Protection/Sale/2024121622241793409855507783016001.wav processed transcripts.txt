[1 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Asset, yeah.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : But again, I understand that you've got these kind of expenses and you're wanting to have those covered. And the reason I ask these kind of questions, first of all, Touchwood, you never have to claim on the income protection, but in the unfortunate case, you can have that pace in mind. We'll be providing that monthly benefit to you. And in terms for those funds available, you have complete control on how every dollar is spent.
[1 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : We have no say if it's to cover the mortgage, children's raising expenses, bills around the home, Even so the medical expenses, it's there to cover those kind of expenses so you can focus on your recovery.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : What kind of expens? Sorry, what kind of occupation do you do? Oh, very nice. You've been in health management for very long.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Health management, Yeah, yeah, a few years.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : All right. You must love what you do by the sounds feed. You've been doing it for a while.
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Good to hear. It's so important to go through a job we enjoy every day. We're at our jobs more than with our own families.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : That's right.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So pleased to hear that, umm, to let you know a bit more about your cover. So we're going to be able to offer you an income benefit of up to 75% of your monthly pre tax income.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So ranges from $1000 as a minimum to a maximum of $15,000 per month.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : And then you can choose to receive that monthly benefit for a period of six months up to a maximum of five years. Umm, And then in regards for applying, we keep it nice and simple. It's done all over the phone. There's no forms you need to fill in. There's no medical checks that needs to be completed. It's just yes or no questions.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : And that's what confirms what the final price will be in the exact terms of your policy. Umm, And then once the policy is in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Just keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply.
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : It's outlined in the policy document.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, that's sort of surprising. Let's work out the best policy for you to be covered for. We'll make sure it's all affordable as well. I do just need to ask you some questions about your duties at work.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Umm, just before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so, it could impact your coverage claims time. OK. Ah, so with a clear yes or no, can you please confirm, do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Sure, Yes.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature?
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes][Agent] : We spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment with yes for that one.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Ah, yes.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Are you required to perform any physical duties? Do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces? Or do you carry a firearm or handle explosives? OK, because yeah, it's a lot safer than those kind of things find in that question. Uh, and need to confirm as well with you. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK. And are you currently employed or self-employed?
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Employed.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Ah, the reason that we ask that question. We do need to know down your annual income before tax. Just so you know, our definition of free tax income is the total annual remuneration paid to you by your employer, Umm, before tax. It is including your salary and regular commissions or bonuses. However, it's excluding employer, Kiwi saver and super super contributions. So based on that, can I ask for your annual income before taxes please?
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK I'm just trying to figure out how I work it out without the QE saver. So the I'm just looking at our pay slip thingy Majiggy. So it is on here. My salary is 334,000 079.84 but I'm not sure if it's with or without the Kiwi saver component. I don't know. I can't remember if that's the total remuneration package.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : I say, OK, did you say 334,000?
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : And yes that's correct, it just doesn't.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, give me one second, I say.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : It's not clear now system how to differentiate.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we would need to be able to find that out. Sorry.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : I, I can try and get it off my I just don't have it in front of me. My individual employment agreement or something like that, that would I be able to provide that by e-mail after the call? I just don't want to get stopped here and then not be able to provide anything because I'd have to go and find it.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Then Yeah, yeah, for sure. Like just to save you from sending the e-mail, we do it all over the phone. So I would need to have you provide that over the phone.
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : OK, Strings.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : But we can arrange it on the call to be able to find that out.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, all good.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Umm, we can based on that $334,000 figure for now. And then if we need to adjust it, we can.
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, sure.
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So what that means is you have the options to to like cover a minimum $1000 to a maximum of $15,000 per month. And then there's $100 increments in between.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Cool.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Now, I understand there's the mortgage that you're wanting to have covered, there's your children's expenses, bills, those kind of things. When you take it in consideration on a monthly basis, how much would you need from your income protection?
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : And it's only going to be at 75 percentile of what I currently earn. That's calculated.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : It's up to 75% of your monthly pre tax income, but up to a maximum 15,000 per month.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, I've marched the pretax, yeah, yeah, which will be I'll be over the maximum I. So I suppose if I think about our current mortgage obligations for we've got 2 properties, so that's 7, 832 plus. It's about 15,000 and that's just for the mortgage.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I see. OK.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : So for the mortgages. So I'd probably need to be looking at a, a quote for the higher highest end of that availability.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, not to worry at all. I'll load that on the 15,000. And then there's a couple of other things you need to factor in as well. There's the waiting period. The waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. So you have the options for either 30 days or 90 days. Which waiting period would you like me to select?
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, 30 days would be helpful.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK. And then there's the benefit. The benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefits for anyone injury or illness. You have the options from six months, one year, two years or five years.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : What's, what's the usual, what's the people usually I have no clue.
[8 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : It's a good question.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : It's a, it's a hard one to answer because to be very honest with you, it's always different in terms of what people choose because it's such a hard question to answer. Like if you ever need to use the income protection, how long are you going to need it for?
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I know how hard of a question it is, I truly do. If you would like to look at a few or if you'd like to look at all of them, I'm happy to try and help as much.
[8 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, if I could, if I could look at all of them, that'd be really good. Just see what it looks like.
[8 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. Did you want to have a look at all of them? Six months, one year, 2 years and five.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[9 minutes][Agent] : All right, let's start with six months.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : This is purely indicative only just to be transparent because we still have the yesterday questions to go through. If we have a look at the top monthly benefit of 15 K, 30 day waiting period benefit period of six months, that is $78.94 per fortnight. Going to one year as the benefit that will be a fortnightly premium of $90.95 per fortnight.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Right. So it gets more as you increase your coverage time frame? Yep.
[9 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right there. Yes, if we go to a two year, it would be $114.66 per fortnight. And then if we look at our top cover that we can offer for you, 15 K, 30 day waiting period, five year benefit.
[9 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[9 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : This is the top policy that would be $154.94 per fortnight.
[10 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and I wanted to check in with you. Are you aware that the premiums that you pay, that they're generally tax deductible?
[10 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no, I didn't know that.
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : It's always something I'd like to point out. Keep in mind that the premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible depending on the policy structure, which could make it even more cost effective for you.
[10 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : MMM, yeah, sure.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Uh, but of course it needs to be affordable for you right now though out of those amounts, uh, do you have, it was the one that stood out again, six months was 7894, one year 9095, uh, two years 114.66 and the five year 154.94. MM Hmm OK.
[10 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : They're all pretty comparable from the price point probably I'd be looking between the one to two years maybe like yeah, that's probably maybe more towards the one year. You would hope and assume that if anything was to happen that you'd be able to get out of it after, you know, no longer than a year.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah, not a worry at all. Then we can keep it as up for now. Then for the 15 pay, 30 day waiting period and benefit period of one year. Umm, the next step is for you of going through the yes or no questions to be able to confirm a final price.
[11 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : MMM, sure.
[11 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Generally I do need to have all the information correct before I can go through it. Going back to the income, I want to double check if I can still go through the question because I'd love to be able to tell you what the final price would be and if we can offer the insurance for you as well.
[11 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, sure.
[11 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Umm, would it be alright if I just pop you a really short hold?
[11 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Cool.
[11 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much. Be one quick moment. Hi. Thanks for your patience. So I just wanted to double check to see if you knew this figure, would you know what it would be based on your most recent tax return? Because that's something that we can go by as well.
[13 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : All good, I've pulled up my renew.
[13 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Uh huh.
[13 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : I can review the tab which I was able to find. I've got my I'm assu. I'm just making this assumption. So I'm just going to take off the 3% Kiwi saver which I'm assuming this is how this is calculate. I'm just trying to work out how to take off so that that number I gave you 344102.24 that's inclusive of a 3% employer contribution securely saver.
[13 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Right.
[13 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : So can you wo I don't know how to work it out, but I don't know how to work it out backwards to take 3% off of that 344102.24.
[13 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK.
[13 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : And that would give us my base salary amount, not inclusive of the because we don't get salaries or bonuses or anything like that.
[13 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, right. Yeah, I see what you're saying. OK, So it's 344, what was after that?
[13 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : It's a fixed amount, Yep, 1102.24 my the wrong number, but I've just pulled up the the letter and so it's a -, 3% off of that and that gives us the salary component without the inclusion of the Kiwisaver employer contribution.
[14 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So you're on a a working statement today.
[14 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : It sounds about right. Yeah.
[14 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : If I just minus that by 3%, that would be $10,323 like yeah, like a equals that would give me a figure of $333,779.17.
[14 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that sounds.
[14 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Would you be confident for me to write that down?
[14 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : That would be it. Thank you.
[14 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : No worries at all. Thank you so much for providing those details. Alright, perfect. So now we've got it all accurate. Umm, I don't think it's gonna impact the amount at all that we can offer. No, not one bit. So we can still offer the full 15K, the 30 day waiting period benefit. One year, that's $90.95 per fortnight.
[15 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[15 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : But let's go through the questions. Let's confirm what the final price is going to be in the terms of the policy.
