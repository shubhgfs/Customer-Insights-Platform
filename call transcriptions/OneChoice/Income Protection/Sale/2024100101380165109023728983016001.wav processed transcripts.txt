[29 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[29 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Umm, the premiums as I mentioned are there. I just want to double check the pricing. Uh, Yep. So the pricing is $33.88 per fortnight still, and that's for the same benefit amount, the same waiting period, and the same benefit now that we've gotten you approved. So my next step would be to get you immediately covered over the phone today. Now you don't have to pay anything upfront today. Instead, what we do is we have you choose the date that you want the first payment to come out. I also attach bank account details again over the phone and I arrange to send out all your personalized policy documents. Now that of course comes with the 30 day cooling off. So you're able to have the cover in place and start it and be covered by us while you're going over everything. If you decide on the end that it's not suitable or you've changed your mind, it's fine. Now. If you cancel it within that 30 days, you'll get a full refund on all the payments you had made in that time, unless of course a claim has been made. Again, if you have any questions, concerns or changes from there, our contact details will be in the policy documents and we can fix most things over the phone. But if you are happy with everything as it is, the only page we link back is your second to last page of the policy that is your beneficiary nomination form. Umm. And as you might already know, all you need to do is fill it out with who the sorry. Actually, I need to double check that. I'm not sure we'll have that, sorry. Let me hope you're on a quick hold. Thank you.
[30 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[31 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much for your patience. I, I apologize, I got confused. I got that one confused with the life insurance. So of course there wouldn't be a beneficiary in nomination form because it's your income protection. OK. Now it'll be the same process for when we first got you covered on the other policy now.
[31 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[31 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : No, OK umm OK so I'll get that all set up and send out 2 copies of the policy. So one will be to your e-mail and the other will be to your home address. And please don't hesitate to give us a call if you have any questions regarding the policy. Umm, there is no such thing as a silly question with these policies. Umm. Now again you get to choose the day that you want the first payment to come out and we generally take payment within the next 7 days. For what date would you like the first payment to be?
[32 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep, just on the top topic of payment. So it's set to buy my card, but do you do you guys pay Amex or no?
[32 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : I've never used Amex before, I'd have to open it up and try it. Oh OK, I've just confirmed for the manager that we got. We do take the Visa and MasterCard though. Or a debit card.
[32 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. And that case, in that case can can we hold off on taking the card details today? But are you able pause because I'm guessing it can't just be latched onto, latched onto my existing policy though?
[33 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : And so if we can't make it into one policy, it would have to be a separate one. Do you not have a a different type of card or bank account details?
[33 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, not only. At the moment, that's the only problem.
[33 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : I see. I can't do we already have your Amex card details?
