[10 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[10 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK. So the question is, is your role of an administrative manager or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment? Yes or no?

So it's like your job, umm, require you to drive a vehicle, like for example, like truck drive truck driver, stuff like that, right? So it's not just driving your own car from work from a house to a house. Do you know what I mean?
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah, OK.
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So that's what the next question is. So the question is, so do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle, Yes or no?

Like for example, as I said, like examples is like a truck driver, you know, they drive a truck because that's their job. That's what we mean. It doesn't mean that you drive your own vehicle because that's just getting from work to and from work. Does that make sense?
