#### Tips for Getting the Most Out of the Platform
- Be specific: The more details you provide (date range, product, brand), the more relevant the insights.
- Use business terms: Ask about KPIs, conversion rates, trends, or summaries.
- Leverage both SQL and transcription data: Ask for both quantitative (numbers, rates) and qualitative (call summaries, reasons) insights.
- Ask for Markdown summaries: All responses are formatted for easy copy-paste into reports or dashboards.
- Respect data boundaries: The chatbot cannot provide raw data or exports, but will always deliver actionable summaries.
- Try combining filters (e.g., by product, brand, and time period) for deeper insights.
- If unsure, start with a broad question and then ask follow-ups to drill down.
- Use the chatbot to summarize, compare, and interpret‚Äînot just to retrieve numbers.
- Review disclaimers for data coverage periods to ensure your queries are within available data ranges.
