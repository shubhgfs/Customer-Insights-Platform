[1 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : No, I have some in place, however it's getting too expensive.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Right, No fair enough. Umm, just a little note, if you are replacing an existing policy, we recommend that you do not cancel that policy until the application has been approved and you have reviewed this policy in full. That's right. And you have reviewed this policy in full as your new policy may not be identical to your existing cover and you S sorry. You should also consider that it may not apply or waiting periods that may start again. So Senior's life Insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones. A lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday. When the policy ends, you can choose cover between $10,000 and up to $200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount. If this is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple and we also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs, to sorry to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at that time. I just wanted to ask as well, Gabriella, have you have you given any thought to your who your beneficiaries are going to be?
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, just my daughter.
[2 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no fair enough. OK, so just in regards to the actual application, it's fairly easy to apply. We just ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you are approved. If you are accepted and once you commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. In addition, there is a ill advanced payment included in the cover. If you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can pay your benefit amount in full to help you with medical costs to ensure you receive the best care possible. Do you have any questions for me so far? No. OK, Nope. Let's go through a quote together. To begin with, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I don't know.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : No. OK. No, that's a good choice, Gabriella. Thank you. And, sorry, could I just confirm your, uh, title please?

[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : No, that 116170, I don't know. I wouldn't mind to see how much 200 is.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah sure.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : MMM.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : We can just start from to make our way down. No problem. OK, so I'll be left for $200,000. You're looking Fortnite, you're looking at a a premium payment of $247.16. That's per Fortnite for the $1000 benefit amount.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : So that's four $400.00 a month.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Uh, well, fi nearly 500 actually. 247.16 per full night would be a close to 500 a month.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Wow.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : We can obviously look at how that announces.
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : MMM.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Well, that's the maximum benefit amount to say for example, if we went down to let's say 180, it'll go down to 222.45 per fortnight. And then if we went down to 150, that would go down to 185.37 per fortnight. Keeping in mind all of the policies, regardless of what I'm going to choose, you're getting a free online legal will valued at $160.00 with each policy and a complimentary subscription of the Australian Senior's Day magazine with each policy. And so in terms of the benefit amount, do you want me to look at other amounts as well or which one sounds suitable?
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : No, no, you, you're way, way, way more expensive than what I who I've been with. So thank you anyway. I mean, you did have an ad saying, you know, seeing as a get a special rate, but it's not.
