So with Australian Seniors life insurance, it, it is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones there through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends, OK. You can choose cover between 10,000 up to $200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount. If death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple and we also include an advance payment of 20% of the chosen benefit amounts to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, so it's easy to apply. We just ask you 8 yes or no questions related to your health over the phone to see if you're approved and if you are accepted. And once you commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK. In addition, and I really, really hope you don't claim on this, but there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. And that just means that if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can then pay your benefit amounts in full to help you with things like medical costs to ensure you should the best possible care there.
