So what I'll do as I mentioned, just to quickly recap, I'll explain the main features and benefits of our cover here at Australian Seniors and then we'll look at some pricing together. Now as you mentioned, you do already have a policy in place. So I just do want to quickly let you know that if you are replacing an existing policy, we do recommend that you do not cancel that policy until your application has been approved and you have re reviewed this policy. As your new policy may not be identical to your existing cover. Now you should also consider the benefits that may not apply or waiting periods that may start again that to Thelma now with Australia and seniors. Our life insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday. When the policy ends.

[10 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : I do miss my son.
[10 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Fair enough. I I guess those things happen.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : I haven't got to see my daughter because she wasn't agreeable because of the emotional mental state. She she's pretty much she can be more or less like closed off unless she she likes staying indoors and not going out.
[11 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, fair enough. Thank you for sharing that with me, Thelma. Hopefully, you know, you get to spend some time with your daughter sometime shortly.
[11 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : I'm hoping to just get away with when she feels agreeable.
[11 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Fair enough. All right then Selma. So it is easy to apply for our cover now. We just asked you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you are approved. Now if you are accepted and once you commence the policy Thelma, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. Now, in addition to this bear Thelma, there is also a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover, which means if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can pay a benefit amount in full to help with medical costs just to make sure you're receiving the best care possible. Now in terms of the cover there, Selma, do you have any questions for me so far?
[12 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. Mm hmm no it sounds pretty good. Oh, does that mean when you say transfer over, does that mean that it you're not allowed to have more than one policy?
[12 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, no, no, I see. If I just wanted to let you know. So if you're replacing your an existing policy, so you mentioned that you wanted a top up, but I do did just want to let you know so you can have multiple policies. No. Yes. OK. Did they answer that? Did they clear that up for you? There someone?
[12 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Oh right, OK, yeah 'cause I'm not so sure. I was thinking of cancelling the policy 'cause I don't want to lose any money.
[12 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yep. No. Fair enough. Yep.
[12 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : I suppose basically I'm looking for a little bit more 'cause I the time is it cost is, you know, a funeral. I'm only going to get cremated.
[12 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yep.
[13 minutes][Customer] : I essentially want to try and make sure that money is left behind for both my daughter and son.
[13 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Yep. Fair enough. Completely understand. There someone that's definitely an option that you can do. Now before we proceed, let's go through a quote together. But to begin with there, Thelma, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[13 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : I don't smoke and I don't drink alcohol. I don't gamble.
[13 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful Awesome. Well, that's I'm happy to hear. So I do Sorry there Thelma, just for compliance purposes. I do just need a clear yes or no. So I'll ask that one more time. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no? Perfect. Thank you for that, Dilma. Apologies, I just had to get that clear yes or no response. So I can see here that you've put through for $100,000. So is that where you'd like me to start today?
[13 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't know. Did I?
[14 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So here it says you've put through our request or just yesterday you were having a look at our life. Go on. And it says here you've put through for a quote on $100,000. So what I can do is I can start there and then if you're we can bring that either up or down depending on what you feel like will be suitable for you. OK.
[14 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Well, probably the 11 main thing I need to establish with you is I'm only on fixed income.
[14 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Mm Hmm.
[14 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : I'm I'm been on disability pension for quite my number 1215 years since that late 40s, early 50s. But I've been trying for over 12 months to get some part time casual work only about three days a week, which succeeded in doing it.
[14 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, OK, OK. No, fair enough there, Thelma.
[14 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : So that just means that I've only got one for the income coming in from Centrelink every second Thursday.
[14 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, no, that's OK there, Thelma. Alright, So what I'll do then. So you mentioned that you were on a disability payment and I would I will just about I'll ask you. I don't think that has sorry. Let me restart that. My words are mumbo jumbo right now. Sorry.
[14 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : So fortnightly I can give you a pension card number if you need it.
[15 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so that's OK. No, that's OK there Thelma. So what I'll do then is I'll quickly we'll, we'll clarify this pricing and we'll see what level of cover works for you umm, and matches your needs. And then from there, we'll move forward based on the questions, umm, just so I can take you through our underwriting and we'll, we'll see if you are approved. OK, awesome. So for that level of cover there, Thelma, I'll start it. What, what level of cover do you feel like would be suitable for you? Like how much do you feel like you need on top of the policy that you already have in place now?
[15 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : I'm not sure what we need to establish is how much would fortnightly payments be.
[15 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep. So for monthly payments are dependent on what level of cover amount that you, you choose. So we can bring that up, we can bring that down. So what I'll do is I'll start it at $50,000 if you're happy to. And then we can increase that if you feel like you need more or if you need less.
[16 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : I just need to know what the total song would be per fortnight. Like every shaky peek.
[16 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that, that's OK. So if we start with ALS, actually I'll start with the 100,000 that you've originally put through for now. If we start at the $100,000 that you've originally asked for quote for the quote for, you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $100.88 per fortnight. Now that's for $100,000 of cover there, Selma. So do you feel like $100,000 cover is necessary or do you feel like you could get you could opt for less just to make sure that your children are covered?
[16 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Where over $100 a fortnight, with the way rent in electricity and foodies is a little bit too much.
[17 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Well, that's why I asked if there are one. Like, what do you feel like you need to cover? So you did mention that you should. You wanted to make sure that there was some, you know, money leftover for your children. Do you feel like $100,000 of cover is necessary to make sure that'll suit your needs, or do you feel like you could bring that down?
[17 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, see, that's the thing. It I need it to be affordable enough for me for you to take the fortnightly payments out of my bank account.
[17 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. No, that's OK. So what we can do? We can look at other levels, some other levels of cover. Now the increments go down in 10,000.
[17 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Please can I just ask you one more question.
[17 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yep, not a problem. Mm, hmm. Mm. Hmm.
[17 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : I've been trying my hardest and really sticking my neck out a lot trying to get 3 days of work, three days paid work a week which hasn't happened yet. Now if and when that does happen, because I'm still going to give it a go for another 12 months. Now if I do get some part time employment, if that is to happen, well when that happens, is it possible to fluctuate the fortnightly payments?
[18 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : What do you mean there? Sorry, can you clarify that there for me, Thelma?
[18 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : If I get some paid employment three days a week work even when that happens, can the fortnightly payment for the POS the policy be increased?
[18 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So like you wanted to, you're saying to pay extra, is that correct?
[18 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[18 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Mm, hmm. Mm. Hmm.
[18 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Because with Gentlelink you can look at an amount of hours and we only, we only lose. I think it's about, I don't know what is it $0.50 to the dollar or something. I think each fortnight will probably only lose off of our disability about 50 to $100 a fortnight.
[19 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[19 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : But that kind of make that kind of makes up it kind of balances out that what you lose with the disability pension you sort of going through working. Does that make sense?
[19 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : MMM, yeah, yeah, no, that makes sense. So let me just confirm with a colleague there of mine again so much because I do wanna just make sure I'm communicating the correct information. So just under just to understand if they're not, you're asking if you were to sorry, you were asking if you would have secure, uh, casual employment, would you be able to increase the amount you pay in premiums? Is that correct? Uh, OK, let me just confirm that for you very quickly, Thelma, and then I'll relay that just to make sure I'm communicating the correct information to you.
[19 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yes, thank you.
[19 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : No worries Thelma, thank you for holding. Won't be long. Hi Don, are you there?
[22 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[22 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for holding there. So I've just confirmed with a colleague of mine and his advise that you don't actually have to pay extra in your premiums if you secure employment. So the premium that you are given is sorry. So the premium that I will give you is the fixed premium that you will be liable to pay based on the level of amount, like level of cover that you choose.
[23 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK. So now otherwise you're telling me that the policy doesn't need to be increased if I do get some plain employment in the next 12 months?
[23 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yes, that's correct. So it only needs to be increased if you feel like you need additional ex additional cover to cover your bases in terms of what your needs are. Yeah, that's correct.
[23 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, alright.
[23 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So that point that I've given you there is a fortnightly premium of $100.88 per fortnight and that was for $100,000 of cover. Would you like me to look look at any other levels of cover and bring that down for you?
[23 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[23 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. So that goes up and down in increments of 10,000. So what would you like me to look at instead of the 100,000 there Thelma?
[24 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I, I don't know. And I don't know how how your polishes would work. 25 or maybe $30.35.
[24 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, so let's have a look. So I'll bring that down to what I can do. Then there Thelma, I'll bring it down to 90,000 or even 80 if you feel like that's enough level of cover for you.
[24 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : That might be better.
[24 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK?
[24 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : I've just got to be able to afford it fortnightly.
[24 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yep, no, that's OK, Thelma. So I'm just trying to make, I want to make sure that whatever level of cover we have available for you, you're able to afford and it's, it fits in with your current budget.
[24 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's one focus done.
[24 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Hmm. So W with the $80,000 there, Selma, you were looking at a fortnightly premium of $80.70 and that's for $80,000 of cover.
[24 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Oh, wow. OK.
[24 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Hmm, No, I can definitely bring that down again some more Thelma, just to see what you're working with. But that's why I asked a little bit earlier, what do you feel like you need to cover if you were to pass away? How much do you feel like would be enough for you to leave behind to your children? Just so you're not being, you know, you're not over insured or anything like that.
[25 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I don't know. That's a sort. Can you just excuse me a minute?
[25 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, that's OK. So, huh, No worries.
[25 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Sorry about that.
[25 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : That's OK, not a problem.
[25 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK, now where were we?
[25 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : We're looking at the next level of cover that you wanted to look at.
[25 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK, well do that. See, H How much more can come down?
[25 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. So we can come, we can bring it all the way down. The level of cover ranges from $10,000 up to $200,000. So it's up to you on how much cover you feel like you will need. Would you like me to look at $50,000 of cover for you there, Thelma? OK, not a problem there, Thelma. OK, so for $50,000 of cover there, Thelma, you were looking at a fortnightly premium of $50.44. Uh huh. Yeah. How's that sounding in terms of suitability? Would you like me to look at some more levels of cover there for you? That's OK there for you, Thelma.
[26 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, look at that $50.44, that's I guess that sounds reasonable enough, the $50.
[26 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, fair enough. So you're happy to proceed with the $50,000 there, Thelma?
[26 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that you said it was $50.00 and what 50% to fortnight, didn't you?
[27 minutes][Agent] : Yep. So for $50,000 Co dollars of cover, you're looking at a fortnightly payment of $50.44.
[27 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[27 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect.
[27 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Could you make it a little bit lower?
[27 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yep, we can definitely do that there Selma. So what I can do is I can drop that down to 40,000 for you, and I'll give you the price for that. So if I've got $40,000 of cover, you're looking at a fortnightly payment of $40.35. There's Thelma.
[27 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that might be a bit better. I've just got to be cheaper that I can balance it on.
[27 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's OK, Whatever. That's what I mean. So whatever's suitable for you and manageable for you, there's Thelma. I wanna make sure that the cover that we select for you will fit directly into your current budget.
[27 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's what I'm focused on.
[27 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Hmm. OK, so for 40,000 we've got $40.35. Now I can bring that down again there, Thelma, if you feel like that's still a bit too expensive there for you, would you like me to bring that down again? OK, awesome. So for $30,000 there, Thelma, your fortnightly payment will be a total of $30.26 per fortnight.
[28 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK, well, tell us what the next one is, $3.26.
[28 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yes, that's correct. And that's for $30,000 worth of cover.
[28 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : OK, Maybe I'll go with that one just to be careful.
[28 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a problem there, Selma. All right, perfect. So what I'll do then is I'll quickly read out an under pre underwriting disclosure. Whoops. Sorry, before I can do that, there's Selma. Can I just confirm your address starting with your post code please Selma.

[44 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So that's OK. That's almost so you can definitely give us a call back. But in regards to the questions, actually I've missed the whole question that I really should have asked you as well there to Thelma, I apologize. So I'm gonna go back to that. Have you been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the last six months or have you been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last seven days?
[44 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : No.
[44 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. Alright, I really should have asked you that question before I took you through, umm, the health questions. But I'm glad to know that you haven't been hospitalized with COVID, Dilma, so that's a good note. Umm, But yes, in regards to the premiums, they asked it, which means, umm, following every policy anniversary, umm, it will increase each year. So for next year, you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $32.38 and then the following year in 2026, you were looking at $34.64. So it increases about $2.00 each year. Hmm. Mm.
[45 minutes][Customer] : Oh gosh, yeah.
[45 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Hmm. Mm.
[45 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : But I'm again, I just want to ask you as to you I buy, What if it gets up to an amount where IC where I can't afford it? Where does that leave me then?
[45 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : You can definitely bring drop your level of cover as well, so you can drop that down more again to suit your budget. Does that make sense?
[45 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[45 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So what I can do, I can look at another level of covers for you again, so we're not completely locked into this at all. So I can look at another level of cover there for you. Let's have a look at that. So you've been fully approved for the $30,000. I can start look at another quote there for you, Thelma, and we can look at the $20,000 as an option as well. We don't have to lock that in now. I do just need to quickly confirm again the Thelma, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months, yes or no? Awesome, awesome. Thank you, Thelma. OK, so we'll look at the 20,000 as well. So for $20,000 of cover there, Thelma, you're looking at a fortnightly payment of $20.18.
[45 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : No, no, right. OK. That might be a good place to start then, $20.90.
[46 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And then just again, your premium is step, which means it will increase each year. So as an indication there, Thelma, just so you're aware, your premium next year will be a total of $21.59.
[46 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I wonder if I've got to give you some more thought.
[46 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : That's OK there, Thelma. So I can also look here, so I can look at the projection for the next 5 years. And so by the time you would be 70 years of age in 2029, you're looking at a payment of $28.30 per fortnight. Yep. So that's what you'll roughly be looking at.
[46 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, alright. They showed me what I said. Expensive. It'll be $28.40.
[46 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : If you would assume that you don't make any amendments or changes to your cover, that's that's the projection that you'll be looking at by the time you're 70, $0.30.
[47 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Thirty cents. OK, at 70 doesn't sound too bad I guess.
[47 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep. And then if you wanted me to add on another five years to that, if you were seventy, once you hit 75, your premium projection would be $39.70.
[47 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK, well, alright, it's good. If that's as good as it scared we'll find a way to cope with it.
[47 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Fair enough there, Delma. Sorry for that. I do apologize. I did not ask you the questions like I should have.
[47 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's OK.

[47 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, between that might sound, that might be a better place.
[47 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep.
[47 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : If it's going to go off each year, that might be a better place to start with.
[47 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. Now again, I just wanna let you know you can also find information about our premium structure on our website there. Thelma, Like I mentioned, the next step is to take you through the I need to take you through the House file questions again, just to confirm you're eligible for the cover. I do apologize for that, Thelma. Now I need to ask the following question again, just because we're looking at a different level of cover. Have you been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the last six months or have you been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last seven days?
