[11 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[12 seconds][Agent] : Hi, my name's Joel. I'm calling from the Australian seniors. I was looking to speak with William.
[17 seconds][Customer] : Hey.
[18 seconds][Agent] : Oh, hi. How you going?
[20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, not too bad.
[21 seconds][Agent] : That's the way the reason for the call. I was following up on your online enquiry to get some quotes for life insurance a moment ago.
[29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, mate. Yeah, very good.
[29 seconds][Agent] : Just yeah, calling to bring up the quotes for you and hopefully answer any questions you might have as well, you know? Sure, I just have to let you know that all our calls are recorded. Any advice provided is general in nature, may not be suitable to your situation. And just to make sure I have your details correct in front of me, can I please confirm I'm speaking with William Allen? Thanks very much. I've got your date of birth here as the 5th of June 1964.
[51 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's the one.
[57 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And you are of course a male Australian resident, correct?
[1 minutes][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Awesome, thanks very much. And if you don't mind me asking, what's made you look at getting quotes for life insurance today?
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : I just have to see it on the the morning show.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. Yeah. Have you ever had this type of insurance in the past?
[1 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Actually, yeah, I've always had it through my my superannuation.
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, that's fair. Look what I'll do while I bring up the quotes. I'll just give you a quick rundown on how our policy works, just in case it is different what you had through your super. Yeah. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. But basically the way our life insurance works, it's very straightforward. So the cover is designed to provide that financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So essentially you can choose an amount you'd like to be insured for. You can nominate up to five people as beneficiaries that will pay that money directly to them when the time comes. It is a worldwide cover, so if you do travel, you'll be covered overseas.
[2 minutes][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes][Agent] : You do or it does triple if you were to pass away due to an accident. So we would pay three times in that case. And it also includes an advance payment of 20% off the benefit amount just to help out with funeral costs or any other final expenses at that time. Now our life insurance, it has been designed specifically with our seniors customers in mind. So we have extended the age of eligibility up to 79. Many people can still apply for it well into their 70s. And we've also simplified the application process as well. So because we only ask eight yes or no questions relating to a person's health in order to apply, it means that there is still the potential for people with pre-existing conditions to still get accepted for the cover. Then that way if you are accepted and of of course, once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death to do any cause at all. Uh, the only thing that's not covered is just suicide in the 1st 13 months. Now there's a couple of features included. So the first one is a living benefit in our terminally ill advanced payment. And this means that if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialised medical practitioner, in that case, we would pay out your claim in full while you're living just to help out medical bills and that sort of thing. Now, getting down to the important part, the cover I can quote you on starts at $10,000, up to a maximum of 200,000. Of course, I'm happy to look at as many options as you like. Umm, what amount did you want me to start the quote on?
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep, what's up with the 200,000 and see how that looks.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Sure, Yeah, easy. OK, just have to confirm. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : I never smoked.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Never. Sorry. Could you help? Your choice. OK, now to give you an example. So if you're looking at a cover of $200,000 for yourself, it works out to be a fortnightly premium of $194.28. That's roughly about 97 odd dollars a week.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, and a box. Yep.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that would of course pay $200,000 to your family or beneficiaries if you passed away or $200,000 to yourself if you were diagnosed terminally ill. I understand. Obviously no one knows your situation better than yourself.
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Does that cover sound like something that would suit your situation or did you want me to look at some other amounts or?
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : No, that's, that's pretty good.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, well look, I realise you just, it's just something you kind of saw on TV. Just let you know what we offer if it is something you are liking the sound of so far. What we do like to do, just quickly go through those eight health questions just so that we could let you know if you are eligible. And then that way if you are approved and if you're happy to, I can send you out the documentation so that you can take some time to read through it. Have a think about it in your own time there. Yeah, just yes or no questions only take me a couple of minutes. You're right to go through those questions now.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, we'll do that.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Sure, no worries. Now the other part to keep in mind is that the premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year. But I do have a premium projection tool here. So I'll just give you an indication exactly what that looks like, just says here as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy next year, your fortnightly premium would be $207.88. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Basically, what happens is roughly 30 days before each policy anniversary, we do send you out an updated schedule letting you know of any changes before they happen. So you'll have roughly about a month each year to re evaluate and work out what you want to do.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : How are you?
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Of course, in case I misspoke, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. Now, just before I do jump into the question, I just want to make sure I am doing the right thing by you. Is that all making sense for you so far?
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : It is, mate. Yeah.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. All righty now I just have to read a pre underwriting disclosure. This basically explains why we ask these questions. Then I'll take you through them. Let's quickly bring that up. Sorry, system's just taking a moment to load. OK alright, sorry about that. Alright so this is here. Please be aware all our calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes and it's just frozen again, so sorry to be a pain.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I'll just pop you on hold for two seconds while I get this back up and running. I won't be a SEC.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Nice.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Thanks so much for holding, sorry about that already. So I've got it up and running now so it just says here.

[10 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, might, yeah.
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Awesome, no worries. Look, no surprises. Obviously you are very healthy. So you have been fully approved for the life insurance? Yes. So you are definitely eligible, which is great. So what that means we do from here, if you're happy to, we organise to send you out all the documentation for you to take some time to read through it and review it in your own times. Make sure that you're happy with it. We actually send out 2 copies, so we do e-mail you a copy which will come through in about 10 to 15 minutes. We also post you out a hard copy as well so you won't have to print it off. That should arrive in about two to five business days. Let's quickly update your profile. Can I get your post code please?
[10 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep, 2508.
[10 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : 2508 And what's the town or suburb there?
[10 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : How Long's there?
[10 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : No worries, let's quickly find that one. OK, 25 Sorry system is doing it again. Alright, so sorry to be a pain. I'll just pop you on hold again for two seconds. I'll just get this fixed up. Won't be a moment.
[11 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : There we go. Sorry about that. My apologies. OK.
[12 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : All good.
[12 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : And now what was your address in Ellensburg please?
[12 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Nine stroke. 15. Stuart. Stuart Street, Hornsby.
[12 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, perfect, Thanks very much. And is that also your postal address?
[12 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yes, thanks you.
[12 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. I was going to say that was #9 of so was that Unit 9 or 15 Stewart St.
[12 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Unit 9.
[12 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. Awesome. All right, so you should receive that hard copy in about two to five business days. But I've got your e-mail address. I'll just double check. Sometimes your system accidentally catches an old e-mail address by mistake.
[12 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep, this one.
[12 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : The one I got on the enquiry was alanwill1964@gmail.com service. No worries, that'll come through shortly. So you can have a read through the SABO, the one that comes in the mail, that one will contain a physical copy of the documentation and also the product disclosure statement. So you can have a good read through, but it will contain the beneficiaries form. So once you review the policy, if you are happy to keep it in force, the only thing we need you to do is just let us know who you'd like to leave the money to. It comes with a reply paid address, so you won't need a stamp or anything. You can just Chuck it in an envelope that'll come back to us. Uh, it's also going to include a free wheel kit, uh, valued at $30.00. So if you haven't already done a wheel, you can use this one.
[13 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[13 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : It does come with step by step instructions, so it's designed so they can do it yourself if need be. Now one thing we recommend all our customer service may or may not apply to you, but just for the record, if you are replacing an existing policy, we recommend that you do not cancel that other one until you have until your application has been approved and you have reviewed this policy in full. As your new policy may not be identical to your existing cover, you should also consider the benefits that may not apply or the waiting periods that may start again. So what we do from our end, because you've been fully approved, we do start covering you straight away just in case, but we don't actually take any payments at this stage. What we do for now just to get the ball rolling is just set up your preferred method of payment, but you can choose a start date in the future that works for you. However, of course once you do review the policy, if there's anything you don't like or even if you just decide not to proceed with it, of course that's fine, you're not obligated to keep it. The policy does come with a full 30 day cooling off period from that first payment date as well, just to give you that bit of extra time.
[14 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[14 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So organize it for the 200,000 at this stage. Uh, did you want to set that up using your bank account or are these all MasterCard?
[14 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : I'd actually prefer to look at the documentation first before I set it up.
[14 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK. There's two options.
[14 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[14 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So I can send out just the information with the quote and also the product disclosure statement first, so you can review that. The only reason we ask for the bank details of this stage is that just allows us to cover you in the interim just in case. Of course, you don't actually have to pay anything until a day that you choose. So it's really up to you what would you prefer. OK, no worries.
[15 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : So well, prefer to have a look at it first, then give it my details, yeah?
[15 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine, no dramas. We'll send out what we call an online activation e-mail. Umm. So because you've been approved, that approval status would be locked in. So if you decide to move forward with it, you can just set it up yourself through the e-mail whenever you're ready.
[15 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[15 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Now, just because it has your personal information, it will be password protected for your security. But the password is just your date of birth.
[15 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[15 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So when prompted, if you just thought so, sorry, there's no spaces in there. So it's like an 8 digit date of birth. So if you just type in 05/06/1964 you'll have full access.
[15 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, Yep.
[15 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Once you review the information, if you are happy to move forward with it, basically all you have to do is click on the button that says buy now. Just follow the prompts. If you activate it we'll you'll be covered straight away and will automatically post you at that hard copy as well. If you have any questions once you receive it or even if you just like to look at some other amounts, there will be a link in the e-mail you can just respond to that. That'll come back straight through to me. Otherwise, if it's right with you, I'll give you a bit of a courtesy call saying about a week's time just to touch base and see how you went with it all. Would that be alright with you?
[16 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that'd be great.
[16 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Sure, I'll just confirm the number I'm speaking to on now ending in 423. That was your number.
[16 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : That's fine.
[16 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thanks very much. Uh William. Now, is there anything else I can help you with while I've got you here?
[16 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : No, all good, mate. All good.
[16 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Easy. Thanks very much for your time. Enjoy the rest of your day.
[16 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : You too, Sir.
[16 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Cheers. Bye. Bye.
