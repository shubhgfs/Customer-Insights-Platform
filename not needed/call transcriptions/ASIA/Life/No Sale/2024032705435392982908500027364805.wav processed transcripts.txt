So in terms of how the policy is designed, Greta, it is designed to provide a financial protection for your last one to a lump sum payment if you had to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. OK, So the policy, you're 52 right now, is that correct? The policy will cover you until your 85th birthday, OK, It will end on your 85th birthday. So to bring out the pricing for yourself, I will need to ask you about your smoking status. Sorry, to begin with a quick question. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?

[10 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that's oh, that's good. Very healthy life choice. If you don't smoke right, your premium tend to be a bit cheaper as well. OK, so it works out well for you. So do you want me to select the highest level of cover from our brand, $200,000?
[10 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : But yeah.
[10 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Just a OK, All right, lovely. So I'm doing the premium for yourself 1st and I'll let you know and I'll add your husband's after that as well. So for you Greta, we are looking at fortnightly $83.72, OK. And that will cover you for the $200,000 policy. And in terms of how the premium will calculate without, I'll let you know that your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year. OK, I, I do have a calculator in front of me.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[11 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Umm, I can give an example how much it will go up each year as an indication. As an indication, Greta, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $89.58 a fortnight, OK, that could be your next year premium and this year it is $83.72 a fourth time.
[11 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't pay anything fortnightly. Can you tell me monthly?
[11 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, so as you can see, does monthly. Sure, definitely. Let me change it to monthly for you. Bear with me for a second. Regardless of how you pay for 19 monthly yearly, your premium remains exactly the same. Sir, I have changed it to monthly. It has changed to $181.40 and $0.40. That will cover you for the $200,000 policy.
[11 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : $181 that's even more expensive than I'm paying at HDF.
[12 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : It is because of the pricing I'm quoting you today greater. It is based on your current age. If you have to take out the same policy say 10 years ago when you had 42, the pricing would have been different. OK. So age it does contribute one of the factors as well when you when you calculate the premium. So This is why the premium it is $181.40. So how is this sounding Great in terms of the pricing?
[12 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : No, it's expensive. So tell me about my husband's one then, please.
