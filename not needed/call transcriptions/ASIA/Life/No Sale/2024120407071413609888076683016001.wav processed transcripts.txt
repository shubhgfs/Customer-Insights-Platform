[1 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Double F double Frey, correct?
[1 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Thanks for that, Geoffrey. And yeah, so so I can have a better understanding of what sparked your interest to which life insurance. Geoffrey, are you new to it? Do you have some cover in place? What's happening?
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : No, I have no life insurance.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Mm Hmm.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : I'm 80 years of age next March. I don't really need it but I just thought it may be beneficial.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : So I'm just looking to get a bit of a feel for what what it might cost me.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Of course, in that case, what I'll do for you there, Jeffrey, is I'll run to the main features and benefits of our product and we can go through some pricing together.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, so Jeffrey Seniors Life Insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones for a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. So you can choose cover between $10,000 up to $200,000 and you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive that nominated benefit amount. So did you have anyone in mind who you'd want that benefit amount to go to, Jeffrey in the case you were to pass away?
[2 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : It would go to my wife.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : MM Hmm. And if you had any children, you could, umm, nominate them as beneficiaries as well.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : No, I would leave it all to my wife and she's a very intelligent woman and she would make her decisions.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : If you wanna leave a hold your wife that jumper, you definitely can. And that's exactly what this policy designed to do, right? It's there for the financial protection of your loved ones when the unfortunate event that we do pass away. And they can use those expense so they can use that for, you know, whatever they really need to at the time. It could be lifestyle maintenance, whatever they really need.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, so if death is due to an accident that you offer, your chosen benefit will triple. And we also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. So it's easier to apply for. We just ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to health over the phone to see if you are approved and if you and if you are accepted. And once you commence the policy, Jeffrey, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : And in addition that Jeffrey, there is a terminally ill advanced payment including the cover. Hopefully you never have to use it. But if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can pay your benefit amount in full to ensure you receive the best care possible. OK. So did you ever any questions relating to the C?
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : OK, not at all.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : I used to work many, many years ago for Australian Mutual Problems Problems Society for a life insurance company, so I'm pretty, pretty familiar with life insurance.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Nice, nice. H how long has it been since you've been in insurance?
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Oh, God, I retired seven years ago.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Nice.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : I stopped work at the insurance company probably over 50 years ago.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : I mean insurance, insurance it's, you know, it's pretty interesting field, right, So.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Well, I, I, I thought it was in those days, but not a great deal has changed. I don't think that the companies like National Mutual and AMP don't seem to have as much of the market now as some of the online type activities and organisations, probably such as your own. But anyway, that's that's life. Everything changes, nothing stays the same.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. The only thing constant is change I guess. But yeah, let's go through some pricing together.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Go for it.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So I just have to ask the question. Jeffrey, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? That's good to hear. That will keep your premiums lower.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : No, well I I think I've put in my application probably 40,000.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So keeping in mind the level of cover range from 10,000 and up to 200,000 there, Jeffrey, what amount would you like to look at first, 40,000? Let's have a look at 40,000 for you. If you want to increase at any point, let me know. If you wanna decrease at any point, let me know. So for $40,000 worth of cover there, Jeffrey, you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $176.62 and dollars and $0.62.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : One let me just 176, 62 per fortnight.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yes.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, Alright. That's really all I needed. Sorry.
[6 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : And, and with that we also provide, and with that we provide a free online legal will. So if you haven't got all that sorted out, you can do that easily online through Safe Will.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : I've got all of that organised, so certainly don't need whatever it is you're offering.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. I mean, if if you know someone that needs 1, you can also gift it if you needed to.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : No problems. Alright, thank you.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so did you, no worries at all. And did you want to look at maybe a lower level of cover or maybe a higher level of cover? I'll give you a pricing on $50,000 worth of cover as well and maybe 30,000 as well.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Alright, that would be good. Yes, I'd appreciate that.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries at all. So for the Fort, the Fort 90 premium, for the $50,000 worth of cover there, Jeffrey, you're looking at $220.78 and for the 30,000, you're looking at $132.47.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep, 13247. Okey doke. And how long will that quote remain?
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Well, so I believe you are 79 years old at the moment. So I believe this pricing will only stay till next year. But next year you're not eligible for cover because it you, you have to be 45 to 79 to apply.
[8 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : I am, yeah. Alright. OK, well look, I'll take all on all of that on board and have a bit of a think about it. And if if I decide to proceed, I shall give you a call back.
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : But of course, yeah, of course. But W, you can definitely do that. But can I, can we just go through the health and lifestyle questions before we go just to see if you are approved for the cover?
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, sure of that.
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because yes. So before we go through the health and lifestyle questions, I just have to let you know your premium is stepped, which W which means it'll increase each year. And as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, umm, for the $40,000 worth of cover, if you make no changes to the policy, a premium next year will be. Let me just load that up for you.
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. And what happens at age 85? The policy ceases.
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : $188.98 Yes, at age 85 your policy ceases.
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : So there is no benefit whatsoever, right? And some, some companies give a refund, a, a proportional refund of premiums paid. So from Australian seniors, that's it all over Red Rover. OK, no worries. Thank you.
[9 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : With us, yes, your policy does sees you, you know it isn't, it isn't like putting money into the bank essentially, Yep.

[10 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Argin so it's unit 10 by 67 to 81 Argentia RGENTEA Blvd.
