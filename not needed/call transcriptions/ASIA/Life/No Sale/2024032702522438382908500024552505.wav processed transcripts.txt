[6 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : No, that's OK. I thought that would be the, you know, I didn't think I'd get it because of that reason. That's why, you know. Yeah, that's OK. No worries. I do. I've had. I took it out years ago.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : I mean, we can also provide you with insurance, but you already, you said you already have, you know, insurance, right, OK, no problems.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So with that one, unfortunately we can't go through with it.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I've had, I've had this going. I wish if I had a brand new one, I took it. I've had this going for about over 10 years. But funeral insurance, it's a lot more than what you're gonna charge. And it's only 7000 coverage anyway. Much to worry.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : The out fee insurance umm if you want no it goes up to 15,000.
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, but I mean, I couldn't take 22 policies out. Oh, can I?
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Umm you can but just I I'm not really sure which umm you can't take. Like without fee insurance you can take more than one policy, but has to equal up to you can't take more than 15,000 I believe.
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. Yeah. So this one, what's the what? Yeah, it's the 7000.
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Umm, let me just confirm with you if it's umm, OK, let me just put you a quick call and see what's the fuel cover you have right now, The funeral cover you have right now 7000.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : It might be 7000. It went up a bit, you know, over the years I since I've taken it out so.
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So I'll just confirm with my manager if you can, if you want to, like if you want to, umm, take another cover, fuel cover.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Wow. I'm, I'm, yeah. Because I'm worried now that that won't be enough. You know, I'm not planning on dying soon, but I'm worried that there's seven. I think it's 7 1/2 thousand. It wouldn't be enough to cover. So if I took out another 5000, that would probably cover it, wouldn't it? Yes, Yes.
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : I can give you some information about like a roundabout of I can give you like a few no fact information just to give you like an average of how much it may cost depending on what your situation is. So, according to the government's Mysmart website, private funerals typically cost somewhere in the region of 4000 for a basic cremation up to 15,000.
[9 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah. No, no, it's OK.

I thought you meant how much it would cost me to take that like a 5000 policy, would you?
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Oh, uh, so so you do want like take 5000? Is that what?
[9 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : I would. That wouldn't Take Me Out of the 15,000.
[9 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : You're OK? Let me just check with my manager if we can do that. Umm, just give me a few minutes.
