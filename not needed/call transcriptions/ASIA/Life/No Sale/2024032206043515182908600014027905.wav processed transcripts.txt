And so do us basically here in the Australian seniors, our life insurance cover, What it's mainly designed to do, right, is to provide a, provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. OK, Now with this cover, we are able to offer you anywhere from $10,000 up to 200.
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Oh, oh, oh, hold on.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : That's right. That's right, ma'am. Yeah. So it covers you.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : So this is only up to 85 years old, Not a life, not a life, 85, but I still carry on living. Then it's not a life insurance, it's a term insurance. It's a term insurance.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So this policy, this policy, this policy, we call it a life insurance policy, it's just designed that way. So it does stop at the age of 85.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : When it stops, there's no longer call life. Life means you have to wait for me to die. Then I don't even get to see the money the family received the money that it's life. But if you if if you stop 85, it's a longer call. Life is called term. So I might as well get a term insurance, correct?
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, Umm, well, this one is just designed that way, doesn't we don't call it a term policy. It's called the seniors life policy.
[5 minutes][Customer] : What is the code? What is the what is the code? What's the price?
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : But you can you can I imagine yeah, again, that's what I mean to help you with today, right? So while I pull up the pricing doors, I'll explain what you actually covered for in this policy so you understand what you're paying for as well. And I'll run to the pricing with you. OK, Uh, if you have any questions again, ask me again. Umm, so with this policy to apply for this cover as well. It's also, it's very simple. We do take you through about nine help questions over the phone to see if you're approved for the cover and if you are accepted with these questions. And once you have decided to commence the policy, we then cover you immediately for death due to any 'cause now the only thing that's not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK. You also get a terminally ill advanced payment with this policy. And what this means, Joyce, is that if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, then we can pay the benefit of man in full to you. So at that time and need, you can use your own life insurance to support your medical expenses and ensure that you receive the best care possible. All right, is that understood so far?
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, carry on.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK. Now the policy also comes with accident cover before you do it. So if your death was due to an accident, God forbid, your chosen benefit a man will be tripled and paid to your family. So instead of 200,000, they'll get 600,000 in the event of an accidental death. OK. And lastly, we provide a funeral component that we understand a lot of families have funds available. But if you go for an unexpected funeral, so if you have passed away at the time of your claim, your beneficiaries can also request an advance payout of 20% of your benefit amount to help with your funeral and final expenses. OK, so those are the benefits with our seniors life insurance. Did you have any questions for me so far on that or is that all straightforward for you then?
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : So the accidental means it's not caused by me. It's accidental because I am involved in it. Not not it's not caused by me. If I caused the accident I cou I shouldn't be paid right?
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So I'll explain what we mean by accidental death for you. OK, Uh, give me one SEC. I'll just pull up my PDS for you. We've got a definition here. It's a good question as well. So under our definition, accident means and events are resulting in bodily injury occurring while the life insured is covered under this policy where the injury is directly and solely caused by accidental, violent, external and visible means without any other contributing causes and where the injury is not self-inflicted. OK. And accidental death means death occurring as a direct result of an accident and where the death occurs within 90 days of the accident.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, accident means it's external. It's not caused by by self. It is self. Then you know the Internet company will go bankrupt.
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Well, yeah, that's what it says in the definition, right? So where the injury is not self-inflicted. So yeah, that wouldn't be covered.
