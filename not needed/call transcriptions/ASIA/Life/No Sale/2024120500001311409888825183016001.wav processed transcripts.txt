I think that you guys as well. I just thought I'd and I just was reading something. I just asked a question. It was more curiosity.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, that's fair enough. So, well, the purpose of my call today is just funny through all the features and benefits. And we can get some pricing for you as well. And you can just stop me at any point in time to let me know if you have any questions. That's no problem at all. And so Senior's Life Insurance is designed to provide financial protect ones, sorry, final financial protection, protection for your loved ones for a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday. When the policy ends, you can choose cover between $10,000 and up to $200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount. If a death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple and we also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help you with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. It's easy to apply, we just ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you are approved. If you are accepted and once you commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. In addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. If you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to lift by specialized medical practice, Krishna, we can pay your benefit amount in full to help you with variable costs to ensure you receive the best care possible. Do you have any questions for me so far?
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem at all. So let's go through a quote together. So just to begin with, have you had the cigarettes in the last 12 months? All right, good to hear, Peter. No problem at all. And now just as a as an example, so you can choose anywhere between $10,000 and up to $200,000. And we can look at different amounts, but say for example, $50,000 in the instance of accidental death, it will triple. So that would be 150 K. And yeah, so that that would give you some idea on what kind of benefits you could get a different amount. So what amount would you like me to quote you on?
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Oh, let's just go in the middle first. Let's just go 100,000.
