[3 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : That I lost it.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Perfect. So life insurance is there to provide financial protection for your loved ones to a lump sum payment if in case you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So you can choose cover starting from 10,000 and you could go up to 200,000 and you can nominate.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No, I've got a rather large family.
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Well, how many people were you wanting to leave money behind for?
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, I got a kidna.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Oh, wow. OK, OK, well, you can look at leaving money for your children, but and if they're minors like my daughter, the money can end up going TH through the the legal guardian at the time or yeah or trust for the benefit of a minor. OK, so if you do have children that are still minors, you can still nominate them if you want.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I got, I got 1 minor, I got 1 minor and the rest are all that.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, all good. Then if you'd like, you can yeah, nominate the the adults to look after the younger one. Definitely something you can do. OK. And the way it works is although we show 10,000 to 200,000 if death was accidental, this payment will triple. So your children can claim for more three times the amount of money that way.
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : And we also advance pay 20% of the money to your children so they can use that money towards anything urgent such as funeral costs at the time. You may even be able to save you bit of money if if you're looking at funeral insurance as well. OK.
[5 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, see TH TH here's another problem I had. I just lost my mum.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : And yeah, that's I'm sorry to hear.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, and I was getting, well, she had a Westpac policy which was with another which another company took over or something.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, right.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : But when I went to ask for help from the insurance provider, they wanted the death certificate.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, OK.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Unfortunately, in the NT they give you the destiny with after you're buried.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : I understand. Yeah. Sorry to hear that. Yeah, For your Peace of Mind, W we can advance pay 20% of the money while you're claiming for it. OK.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, I I want to claim. Maybe it'll be somebody else. I'll be dead, man.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So that one money can come out first to to help out with the funeral costs and then, yeah, you can provide the debts, of course.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : I can't claim it if I'm dead.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. So TH then this would be responsibility for your children. OK. Yeah. So of course, no. Yeah, sorry about that. And we, we try and make our cover simple to apply for. So we don't need you to see any doctors for us and we don't need you to spend an hour over the phone answering and answering questions. We literally just ask you no, yes or no questions to see if you qualify. So we, we try and make it easy.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : And if you are accepting and once you commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except for suicide in the 1st 13 months. And then.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Well, I ain't going to do that. I like, I like living.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Good to hear. And you got eight children as well, right? So yeah, all good.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Some of it will happen. Even when I hear it will happen.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : I got a 7 month payment myself so yeah, I got to look after my kids and we'll.

[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, my, my eldest is 32 and I'm still looking.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : And, and yeah, yeah, fair, fair enough. They're always gonna be yeah kids, right?
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Opera might the way the world's gone now you'll be looking up from forever.
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, fair, fair enough. If they moved out yet or still living with you.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no, that that makes that. I told him to get that.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Oh, good. That's probably the way to go, huh?
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So alrighty A and Liz, you can actually claim for the cover yourself as well. There is a terminally ill advanced payment.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, you can claim for your insurance to be paid to while still alive.
[8 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, so yeah, that that's literally your money. So you you can spend the money whatever you see fit.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Y you can use give it to your children, spend it on yourself to try and get better or or even start arranging some of the the the funeral costs you if you do happen to get better, no need to return that money. You get to keep it. OK.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Oh, very good. So if I took what's the, what's the maximum amount? What is it?
[8 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So this is 200,000 is maximum.
[8 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So just to give you some pricing on that, I just need to ask, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Love you.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yep, all again.
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, trying to get those up.
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So minimum is all good if you do, if you do then that's great, saves your health and bit of money, right?
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So if the maximum was 200,000, mix minimum was 10,000. I understand you have eight children, so how much did you want to look at for yourself?
[9 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : I'm not quite understanding what you're saying mate.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, so we can help you look at our life insurance to leave behind money for your children, right? You can look at minimum leaving them 10,000 or you could go up to 200,000, or you can look at somewhere in between like 100,000 or 80,000. That's what I mean.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : H, how much did you want to look at leaving behind for them?
[9 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Well, I, I'm, I'm looking at the, I'm looking at the cost I can get.
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, highest.
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : So the 200,000 I'll, I'll probably go for.
[9 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So that then that case you're looking at 142 dollars, 20-12 cents a fortnight. So was that affordable for you? Was that manageable? OK, so it's OK for you then or? Yep.
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Well, I'm working at the moment, so yeah, what happens if when I get all the I can't work anymore? Then what happens if this influence?
[10 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Understand if you Yep, that's a very good question. If you're not working anymore, your income's reduced. If you ever do feel you're it's depends are not affordable, you are able to apply for financial hardship. If it's something temporary, we can work out a payment plan with you. If not, you're not locked stuck at this level. You can apply to reduced to cover to try and find a middle ground to see if we can find something that may be suitable at that.
[10 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. What I'm saying is, you know, I've worked.
[10 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK, then.
[10 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : You say I work to my retirement and then I become a pensioner and I paid all the years of this cover.
[11 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yep, it does seem that way. Yeah, and it does seem that way. However, what what you're paying for is the time you're being covered. So let's say if you retired in 20 years time, then you would have had coverage for the 20 years and then if you applied it, drop it down in 20 years. You can do you just give us a call, apply to reduce it. So I can try and see if we can find something that can be manageable for you at that stage.
[11 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : And then your company goes, oh, I'm sorry, we're going to drop it down because I gotta get appointment that I said yeah, yeah. Well, hopefully I get.
[11 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So you're not, well, it's not like a savings account, you're not saving up money. You're basically just buying time where you're getting covered for, that's all. Does that make sense?
[11 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, you know that, Yeah.
[11 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So it's a good question. So did you, was 200,000 still appropriate for you or did you want to look at something smaller?
[12 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Well, I think for now, I think I'm, yeah, I'm pretty good at the moment. What's the other one?
[12 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, you, there's many other levels so you, you can go all the way down to 10,000 using 10,000 increments.
[12 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : You got the 10 that I want that What's the 181?
[12 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So I could do 1918170 so on and so forth all the way down to 10,000 if you want sure. So 180,000 is $127.91 a fortnight. So yeah, that will get you 180,000. And if you want to work out the Yep, it's very good question.
[12 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : 12791 And when you when, when are these these payments rather so you you sent me out a contract while signed the contract and is that when you start taking the payments out or do you have a some insurance company give you the month for free or whatever? And is that many of these bloody insurance companies?
[13 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : That's all good. Well, all all the companies may work differently with us. We make it very simple. I ask you none, yes or no questions about your health. If you're approved, then we start the cover over the phone. You you not required to make an immediate payment straight away.
[13 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[13 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : You can choose the payment date in the future and I'll you'll receive your post within three to five working days from the day you choose to be your first payment. We note down the preferred method of payment, what you're using to pay for it, and you'll also have a 30 days calling off.

[13 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So that's how we set it up, but OK, Yep.
[13 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So it is, yeah, If we can, if we can stop that off.
[14 minutes][Agent] : So, but just before we start, it was the 180,000 OK for you? OK, cool. Yeah, we just got to find a level that you're happy with before we can actually start it. OK.
