So at the end of the day it's designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones in the event that Touchwood something lost out for yourself. Now the way that we do that through a lump sum payment of between $10,000 up to $200,000 depending on your personal needs with the coverage as well. It does also include a terminally ill advanced payment, which means if you were diagnosed with a terminal illness with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we'll pay out the claim insulin that situation so that you can get the best medical care or anything else you might need as well.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Now, the cover does include an accidental death benefit. So because accidents are so unexpected and potentially very sudden, you understand there could always be other costs left behind for your loved ones. You know, things like unpaid bills.

[2 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Now the policy, it's, uh, it's not a guaranteed acceptance. Not everyone is eligible for it. The good thing is we don't expect you to go through any medical checks, no blood tests, nothing like that. Instead, we just take you through a series of simple yes and no health and lifestyle questions over the phone. And then if you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for that due to any goals. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months.

[3 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, no problem, No problem. Well, let's work on the 100,000. If we're looking at $100,000 life cover now, that'll include the $100,000 terminal illness, which will put 300,000 in the events of accidental death, so that you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $204.46.
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sorry, let me just have A to how much does it charge $204.46?
