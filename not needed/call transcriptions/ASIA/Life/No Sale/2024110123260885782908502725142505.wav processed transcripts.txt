[2 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, Is this the first time you're looking into it? OK, yeah, what I'll do is I'll explain the main features and benefits and just run through some pricing with you as well. So seniors life insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones to a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends.
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Alright. OK.
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : So you can choose cover between 10,000 up to $200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : If death is due to an accident, your choice and benefit will triple and we will also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : No lately. Done. OK.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, I yeah, so it's easy to apply for them. We just ask you a yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you are approved and if you are accepted. And once you commence the policy, you will be covered for sorry, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. In addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or left to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can pay your benefit amount in full to help with medical costs to ensure that you receive the best care possible. So I think of it as like a living benefit that you can access if if you were in that situation, you're knock on wood, that doesn't happen, but that is available to you.
