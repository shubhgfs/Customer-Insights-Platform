[1 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Well, yeah, there might be some different, umm, benefits and, and features, umm, within our own product as well. So what I'll do Chris, is I'll explain the main features and benefits and run through some pricing with you. Umm, But as you mentioned before, you do have some cover in place already.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : But if you are replacing an existing policy, we recommend that you do not cancel it until your application has been approved and you have reviewed this policy info as it might not be identical to your existing cover. Umm, and just a couple of things to know as well that you should consider, uh, the benefits that may not apply or waiting periods that may start again. OK, yes. So, umm, obviously you've had an idea of what, umm, you know, life insurance is, but it's the same as us, uh, here. So our cover, it is, is designed to umm, sorry, let me just get back one second here, Chris, I just need to set this up for you. Yes, So, uh, seniors life insurance. Hi Chris, just to get cut off there. Uh, it's designed to provide financial protection to your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, So, uh, let me just go back. Sorry, just keep losing my thing here. OK, so let me just start over again for you Chris. Sorry about that. Umm Seniors Life Insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. OK, so you can choose cover between $10,000 up to $200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount. If death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit Rd. triple and we will also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. Umm, it's very easy to apply Chris, we just asked you 8 Yes Sir, no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you are approved. So no blood tests? No, you know requesting for your medical records or anything like that. If you are accepted and once you commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK. In addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can't pay a benefit amount in full just to help out with medical costs or ensure that you get the the best care possible. Umm. So just to check in with you, Chris, have you got any questions so far? Or like, is that sounding like there's a few different?
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm, I'm fine.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I, I, I would be just interested what would be the, the, the, the monthly yearly premium.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, yeah, of course. So just so I can provide you a quick quiz, I do need to go through some some questions with you. It's just some health and lifestyle questions, if you're OK with that. Umm, so let's go through a quote together to begin with. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no? No.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : So, you know, I don't want to waste your time if this is, you know, no, no.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. Uh, let me just pull this up for you. OK, So keeping in mind as well, Chris, I did mention it earlier, cover ranges from 10,000 and up to 200,000. We can look at different amounts until, you know, you decide that it's the right level of cover for you. But did you have an amount in mind? Yeah.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : 110 That's what I have currently.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, cool. OK, So I'll just look into this for you, Chris.

Would you like to look at any other levels of cover or how's that sounding to you?

Umm, And as an indication, if you make no changes to your policy, I'll just have a look. So if you make no changes to your policy, your premium next year will be $240.65. OK. Umm, is that something that you'd be happy to go ahead with or?
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, I probably, I would leave it at this point. I just wanted to check whether there is anything that could be out, you know, worth considering. But since I am with the current one for quite a while, then you know I would probably leave it the way it is.
