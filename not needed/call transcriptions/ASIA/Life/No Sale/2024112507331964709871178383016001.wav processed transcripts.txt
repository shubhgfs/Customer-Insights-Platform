In addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover, which means if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less live by specialized medical practitioner, you can pay your benefit amount in full to help you with medical costs to ensure you receive the best care possible. Do you have any questions for me so far there Joe?
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : No, keep going.

[3 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : What amount would you like me to start at the maximum? OK. OK. So Joe, of $200,000, which is the maximum, you're looking at a payment of 656.64 per fortnight. In addition, we do provide you with the free online legal will and valued at $160.00 with each policy and a complementary subscription of the Australian Seniors Day magazine with each policy. Would you like to look at any other levels of cover or that sounds suitable?
