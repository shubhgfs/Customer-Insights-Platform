[13 seconds][Customer] : This is great. Good.
[15 seconds][Agent] : Hello, good afternoon. It's Rick giving a call from Australian Famous Insurance. How are you?
[20 seconds][Customer] : Good.
[23 seconds][Agent] : But yeah, it does come through pretty quick if you're not on the phone to get to it straight away. Of course, that's the reason for the call to take you through the life insurance cover, get you some pricing into that one as well. Just to confirm, I've got your details correct.
[39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[37 seconds][Agent] : I'm speaking with Greg Tarplet and the date of birth I've got for you as the 22nd of the 12th, 1959.
[46 seconds][Customer] : That's right.
[51 seconds][Agent] : That's no problems. And just Please note our calls are recorded. Any advice that provides general nature might not be suitable to your situation. And could I confirm you're of course a male Australian resident?
[47 seconds][Customer] : So I have to get a nice present this year, yes?
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Of course, no problems. Well, I'll take you through, get you some options here on that cover and if there's any questions along the way, just let me know and so I have a better understanding. Was the life insurance new to yourself or what's got you looking into it?
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, look, I had, I had life cover, which unfortunately due to a mix up expired it, it didn't get paid.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, Mm, hmm.
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : And I, we moved and I didn't get the bill and you know, so it expired. So and I, I did something so well, well, I'm probably old enough to qualify for you guys.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Mm, hmm yeah, 'cause no worries with that. Well, I'm sorry to hear the previous policy. I understand that. Well, I appreciate just taking the time as well with us to look into some options around.
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : It will take you through helpful to find a suitable solution for you with our last cover as it is designed very straightforward there to provide you a bit of peace in mind and also provide a financial protection which is paying out through a lump sum time in in the event if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday. When the policy ends, you can choose cover. We offer between 10,000 up to a maximum of 200,000. So did you have an amount in mind you'd like to have a look at first?
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, 200,000 would be enough.
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : 200, not a problem.
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : That's an excellent.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yep, we can do that. I'll get some options for that amount if you need to adjust it. I can quote you on as many amounts as you need to as well.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, sure.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : And also to mention, it's up to you to choose who that's paid out to. So you can list up to five beneficiaries to receive it and split it into percentages if you wish to as well.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : And you can change it down the track, I imagine, if you need it.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, of course.
[2 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : You can always have that updated if you, if you require that umm. And if it is still a lump sum payment, there's no restrictions on the payout.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Well, it won't be my problem. Yeah.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So it can really be used to anything maybe to help with at that time you're holding that case and you wouldn't have a plan how it needs to be used. Umm, in in the case that it wasn't the case, but if death was due to an accident, that benefit amounts paid out as triple umm at that time.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Oh, really? Yeah, It's a bonus.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, yeah, that's, that's triple.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Well, insurance is always the one thing you want you want to be hoping you're wasting your money on, but yeah.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : But we again have that touching with that doesn't, wasn't, doesn't occur now we do, yeah, yeah. So hope you don't need to use that anytime soon. Of course, umm inhale. We do also include for you it's an advanced payment, so 20% year benefit amounts paid out at the time of claim while the format's being processed. And that's to help with the funeral expenses or any other immediate expenses at the time as well.
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : That makes sense.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yep. We do have an application for it, which is easy to apply. It's eight yes or no questions we have in relation to your health. That's to say if you can get you approved and just say if you are accepted. And once you decide to commence that policy, it covers you immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Mm.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Hmm, fair enough. No, well, I wasn't thinking about that. That's good to know.
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it's cool. So yeah, none of that, umm, in addition to that, there's a built in terminal illness benefits. Like if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can tie up the claim to yourself in full lost or living. You can use that toward medical expenses or anything else I can help you out with as well.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Now I'll get you some pricing to start with. Did you have any questions around that? So far all good. No worries. Just to start with, can I confirm, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : No, no, that's all probably straightforward, no?
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : All good. Now we'll start off with the 200 bears. Let me know how that Sandy. If you need to adjust it, umm, cost, just let me know that. So the top cover 200,000 with $600,000 accidental death, 200,000 terminal illness built in.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Fortnite.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : We'd be looking at $272.48 a fortnight for the top cover, no?
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : That's interesting.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, we can do it umm, monthly if you prefer. You can either do it fortnightly, month or yearly. It's a fine payment across for you. It's whichever is easiest for you. So if you are looking at it monthly would be exactly $590.38 in title. Let me know, would that be suitable or would you like to have a look at any other amounts?
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : I missed a monthly, but yeah, no, I'll just you'll keep the back in a minute.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Keep it there, not a problem. And also just to make you aware of with your premiums, it is stepped, which means it will increase each year, but with that increases, it's not directly based off age. So to give you a bit of an indication of that, uh, so if you make no changes to your policy, premiums for next year would be $631.71 per month in total, the next year's cover. Umm, and if you ever need, you can also find information about the premium structures on our website as well. Yeah. Now what I can do, we see now the next step is to take you through those health questions, see if we can get you eligible into the cover to start with, and I can get some options after that for you as well. Yeah, Just to confirm, I've got your other details up to date, Your e-mail address, ivegotthatassogregtoplet@gmail.com. Yep. And preferred contact number just for mobile 0410467183.

In the meantime we send off your documents, you get e-mail and a hard copy through the post as well and it does give you a 30 days calling off.

Would you prefer this to come from a Visa or MasterCard or just a big span account number?
[12 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : No, I'd probably prefer to pay for it myself. Pay it each month?
[12 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK. Not so much with regards to that. Unfortunately we don't have like a day pay or other time and option unfortunately because with our policies it is set up by direct debit either through a card or BSP. Would that be suitable for you at all?

Umm, no payments will come out until the the 1st of next month, umm, as a preference and the 30 days does start after your first payment thereafter as well. But umm, if you're not looking to to note that down currently, what I can do is always get that sent off with the course for policy information. Also the pricing attached fee as well.
