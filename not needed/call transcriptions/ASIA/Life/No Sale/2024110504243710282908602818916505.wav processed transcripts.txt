[7 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[8 seconds][Agent] : Hello, Hi, this is Ricky calling you from Australian Seniors. I'm just following up on your online enquiry in regards to our life insurance. You put it through on the 29th of September there. I'm just here to take you further with that enquiry. I just a few details I've got to confirm with you. First off being that is your full name Venkatswami.
[27 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[28 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic. And your date of birth is the 30th of the 12th 1955, correct?
[34 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[34 seconds][Agent] : Alright, thank you. Now Please note all our calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general nature and may not be suitable to your situation. Now then, California, can I confirm that you're both male and an Australian resident? OK, perfect. Thank you. Now, just so I can understand, you'd be better today.
[49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I just want to.
[56 seconds][Agent] : What Co, what prompted your inquiry into our life insurance you saw on Facebook? Yeah. No, that's fine. Yes, See how it goes.
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : It was on the Facebook so I thought I tried it and see how I go with this.
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, not a problem. Well, thank you for putting the time up to have a look at our insurance. I really appreciate it. Now with our life insurance, right, what it's designed to do, it's designed to provide our financial protection for our loved ones in the case if we were to pass away. And that's through a lump sum payment before your 85th birthday when the policy ends, OK? Now with our policy, you can choose cover up between $10,000 up to $200,000 and you can actually nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount, OK? And that's entirely up to you. That's who you pick. And if death is due to an accident, what we actually include is if there was death due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : None.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : And we also include an advance payment of 20% off the benefit amount to help with renewal costs or any other final expenses at that time as well. OK now without cover it's easy to apply, there's no comfortable medical checks or blood tests, we just ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you are approved. Now if you are accepted and once you commence the policy you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK. Now in addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So what this means is if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less live by a specialized medical practitioner, what we'll do is we'll pay your benefit amount in full to you.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : None.
[2 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So 100% of that goes straight to you to help you with medical costs just to ensure you receive that best care possible. OK, now that's for the worst of situations, but just know if that were to come, hopefully not anytime soon, but if that were to come, just know you are protected. OK, Now with everything said so far, do you have any questions for me at all, Venkat, or was everything crystal clear?
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I understand what you said.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. All right, in that case, let's go through real quick together. OK, to begin with, have you had a cigarette in the last 1212 months?
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't smoke.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic, that's great news. So there you go right now, keeping in mind the level of cover ranges from $10,000 and up to $200,000 and we could look at different amounts until you find the right level of cover for yourself. OK now Venkat, what were you looking uh, to cover yourself for with the life insurance? Was it going to be like like a mortgage? Was it going to be funeral? What did you have in mind?
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : No, I just.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah funeral yes.
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes][Agent] : So you've, it can be used either for, uh, funeral, uh, sorry, funeral costs or just living expenses, even medical expenses in the case where something would happen to you right now, keeping this thing is in mind, umm, if you were thinking of covering a funeral, what were you think of covering? Was it going to be like a cremation or was it going to be like a burial service?
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Oh, just the whole whole process, you know?

[4 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Oh, about 100, yeah.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a problem there. OK, fantastic. Now for $100,000 of cover, you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $178.58 there. OK, So that's 178.58 and that is per fortnight. Now, how is this sounding in terms of suitability or did you want to look at any other levels of cover there?
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yes. What? What's that monthly one 5300?
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So if you were looking at monthly, you're looking at $386.93 there. OK. That is $400,000 of cover there. Now, how's that tire signing in terms of suitability? Did you want to look a higher low? What would you like to do? Yeah, we're happy with this level of cover.
