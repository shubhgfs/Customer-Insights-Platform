[3 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So just looking to protect your daughter in case something was to happen to yourself there, of course. Well, thank you for giving us the ring in here. What I'm going to do for you is just give you a explanation to what the life insurance is all about and then we can jump into some pricing for yourself there. So the way that the life insurance has been designed, there is to provide the financial protection for your loved ones through that lump sum payment. If you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. Now you can choose cover between $10,000 up to the maximum of $200,000 off the protection. Now if your death was unfortunately there due to an accident, what will happen with whatever benefit amount that you do choose, it will be a triple to payouts. So if you go for like 10,000 that'll triple to a 30 and and vice versa with all the covers. Now it's easy to apply. As I said we just ask you 8 yes or no questions just relating to your health over the phone to see if you are approved.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Now, if you are accepted and once you commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Now there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover, which means if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, it does allow you to call up yourself and you can actually, uh, claim on your full life insurance whilst you are living. Umm, now let's jump into some pricing for the life insurance. So just to begin with there, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no Beautiful. And what level of cover we thinking that you would like to protect yourself for from 10,000 up to 200,000?
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : No, no, 200,000.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yep, let's have a look. So if you're looking at that one for yourself, they're on a fortnightly premium set every two weeks are $454.40 every two weeks.

[6 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine. Yeah.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So that that level covers fine, OK, no problems at all. So what we'll do now is we'll jump into the health questions and see if you are eligible for the cover. But look, just before that one there, uh, we are going to send you off a uh, free Australian legalized wheel kit. So I'm not too sure if you've, I've got that one with the previous cover, but if you do, you can give this.
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : I I already have the will.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yep, no problem. Look, it is something that still does come free of charge. So you're not paying for it. I look, you can keep it off to a family or friend. It's not legally bonded to yourself there Now in regards to your premium, your premium is step, which means it will increase uh, each year.

She has sent in the documents she said before umm, but it hasn't been actioned from our end. So I'm just trying to say before I set up a life cover what I need to do because I obviously can't write the declaration in that bank. But that's not her legal name.

[13 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[13 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.

And there was no change to the title. So they actually didn't have sent anything to us. We didn't have anything. Every day they consider the center.
[13 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, so before I set it up, basically we've got to get the documents here to change the name.
[13 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Uh, yes, I'll just have a double check. So there was a new policy.
[14 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So if you look there, I just, I just quote it for life. So she's happy with that. But she, I just don't want to have, I don't want to sell it in that name because she said that I have full names. Joseph. Yeah. JOSAPH. That's apparently her full legal name.
[14 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, Her full name is Dressif isn't her name is Summer Comments or something? Isn't that OK?
[14 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so that's, so that's that's the secondary name. But apparently her first name is Joseph. Umm, yeah.
[14 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK, Umm, is it OK if I just place you on a brief hold while I have a look at this?
[14 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : All good, all good.
[14 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Thanks. 1 moment. The. None. The. The. None. Thanks for holding.
[17 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Oh, good.
[17 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : All right, so I'm going to look into the policy. It looks like the there's a TPA on the policy. That's totally.
[18 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[18 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : So it's Angelina Graham, that's the TPA and the bank and the third party payer, uh, for this funeral policy. Uh, so you definitely have the custom online with the third TPA.
[18 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So I've got Joseph.
[18 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK. So I don't know who cares if it is because there's a different name on the policy for the policy owner and a different name for the TPA of the policy and the payer.
[18 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : This is This is a mess.
[18 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, I'm not, yeah, we're a bit confused about what to do here because, uh, if she wants to update the name, she can send through the change of name requirements to us. But, umm, in terms of setting up the new sale, I, I'm not too sure to be made to check with one of your managers to see, umm, what they, what they need to do.
[18 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, OK. Umm, what's that client ID so I can just jump back into it?
[18 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I'm just gonna leave my note and jump out now.
[18 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : All good? Yep.
[18 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Uh, so it's 573-9162.
[18 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Let me jump back in.
[19 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Just say one night.
[19 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, all good. Yeah.
[19 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I see a little bit confusing this one as well, so I'm not too sure what to do. OK, I'm not now.
[19 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : All right, beautiful.
[19 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[19 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Thanks and Daniel, bye.
[19 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Thanks. Bye. Bye. OK.
[19 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : All right, thanks for holding. I do apologize about that delay. We're just trying to work through this one here. So I might be about another minute or two and I'll come back to you. Alright, thank you very much for your patience. And so I just want to clarify something here. So you mentioned there that back in April that you did send through the name. Now why was the why was this name originally put down on the under the account there?
[22 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Because that's the name also. So my name Martin, me to Summer. So they what they did is they put this to Summer, but they didn't put the first part of my name. So I have a very long name. It's a shorter name. Yes. I thought it'd be good if they had my whole name.
[22 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, so this is this is just a short name for you, is it right? OK, because that's where we're all getting a bit confused because we thought it was a complete name. I'm sorry. It's so the first part of the name. OK, this makes.
[23 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it's for the first part of the name is Joseph Martin and then me to Summer, daughter of KJ Joseph and then surname. So the name is correct. It's just almost my first name. Surname is my surname, but it's a shortened form of my longer name.
[23 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, this makes more sense just because customer support we're a bit confused with all this and I was confused as well. OK, So what I'll do then for this one here is let me get back to your customer support and we'll just put in the first name. So you said it was Joseph, Was it? Was it Joseph Martin?
[23 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Well, I can e-mail my passport now, so you guys have it.
[23 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, look what I want to do here. Let me just have a chat with them there. So was it Joseph or Josephine?
[23 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : No. Joseph. Joseph. It's a guy's name. Joseph Martin.
[23 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep. OK, just stay with me. Let me get this one changed over. So just stay with me there.

[26 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So Daniel was helping me before but can't get back through to him.
[26 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : So Daniel was helping me before, but can't get back through to him. Yeah.

[26 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : The customer originally has given us her short and legal name. Yep.
[26 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Now I'm about to set up a live policy for her but she's just mentioned that she the name is on the account.
[26 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Now I'm about to set up a life policy for her, but she's just mentioned that she the name on the account there in the short name.
[26 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : There is a short name, so she just needs to pop in the two first parts of her name.
[26 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : So she just needs to pop in the two first parts of her name. Alright, so and just jump into the policy. Just give me a SEC.
[27 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep.
[27 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : I'm just gonna double check whether we can do that over the phone or whether they've got to send the details in to update the name. So just give me a SEC.
[27 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, all good. I can see back in April that we went through this process whether she's saying that she did send all the documents in copy the passport, she did all that information back in April and it's just has never been actioned apparently.
[27 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, that's weeks.
[27 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : We've usually if it's done and the documents the authorized accepted by it's all updated.
[27 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Usually if it's done and like the documents are authorised and accepted by admin, it's all updated. And then if the documents aren't approved, then we usually call the customer back and let them know. So there you go.
[28 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Is a shortened name, Yeah.
[28 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : So it's only, so it's so that name that she's got on the file now, is that so that's like a middle name or something, is it?
[28 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So that's one of the middle names, full names Joseph Martin and then the rest of the the name on the profile.
[28 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Or Alright, so it's only if we can only do it over the phone if they're wishing to add a middle name without. Yeah. Or if it's I, if they're changing it from like PM to Pamela or Tim to Timothy, then we can do that without any evidence that if she wants to add her actual whole name. Yeah, we need to have the documentary sent back in.

[29 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So I, yeah, you can let her know. Yeah, put her through and I can just let her know what's needed to send through.
[29 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep. And then if you can umm, miss me maybe on teams and let me know that I can go in and leave my notes after that.
