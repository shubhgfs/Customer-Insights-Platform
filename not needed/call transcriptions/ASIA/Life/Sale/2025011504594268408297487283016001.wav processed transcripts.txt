[7 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I'm good. Thanks mate. How are you?
[9 seconds][Agent] : I'm good, thank you.
[15 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[10 seconds][Agent] : I was calling to take you through that funeral insurance enquiry that's just come through online now to take you through the cover.
[17 seconds][Customer] : So has that come? Has that come through to my e-mail address? Has that?
[22 seconds][Agent] : No. So your details have come through to us.
[24 seconds][Customer] : Oh, sorry.
[24 seconds][Agent] : That's why we're giving you the call. Just.
[25 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes, yes. OK, not a problem.
[26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, it's just yeah. To explain it all, run through some pricing, umm, and answer any questions you might have as well. Just before we start, I'd need to let you know all of our calls are recorded.
[32 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[35 seconds][Agent] : Any advice I provide is general in nature. I may not be suitable to your situation. I'll just confirm these details are correct. I'm speaking with Miss Diane Mueller.
[44 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[45 seconds][Agent] : Your date of birth is the 20th of the 3rd, 1953.
[48 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[49 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. And you're a female and an Australian resident.
[52 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[53 seconds][Agent] : Awesome, thanks for confirming all that. Now, just so I know how to best help you out there, are you brand new to this sort of cover or do you have cover elsewhere?
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm brand new.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. I'll explain the, the main features and benefits there and we'll jump into some pricing as well.
[1 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : At the end of the day, the covers there to provide a cash benefit anywhere between 3 and $15,000 to your loved ones, so they can use that towards your final expenses, funeral costs or that sort of thing. OK, umm, who in your sort of close circle or family would you be leaving it to?
[1 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK, my brother probably.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Your brother. OK, Perfect. Yeah, it gives him the chance to have that. You know, that's finances. They're ready to go to be able to use it on your funeral costs. OK, You can nominate up to five people or just your brother. Totally fine.
[1 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : If you wanted to update it at a later date, that's fine. Now, on the cover. If your death was due to an accident, never a pleasant thing to think about. But if that was the case, your chosen benefit amount would triple, OK?
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. OK, not a problem.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Now, up until the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, any time up until that point, if you suffered an accidental serious injury like quadriplegia or paraplegia, that's also covered and the benefit amount would triple as well if that was the case, OK, So a bit of extra protection there for accidental death and serious injury.
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Now it's a guaranteed acceptance cover. So you're an Australian resident aged between 14 and 79, so no medical checks.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : You could you go to take out the cover, OK, in mind for the 1st 12 months you'll be covered for that accidental death and accidental serious injury only then after that first 12 months, you're covered for death due to any cause at all. OK, Now another thing we include as well, it's something I hope you never have to claim on, but it's a terminal illness benefit, OK?
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK, not a problem, right? Yeah. Yep, Yep. OK, good.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : What it means is after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness and given 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, you can come to us yourself and we can pay out your claim in full whilst you're still living, OK? You can use that money towards, you know, medical expenses, have access to it, put your own plans in place, whatever it might be.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK, fine.
[3 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK. How is that all standing there so far?
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yes, good.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. OK. Now between 3 and 15,000, what sort of benefit amount were you looking at there?
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Oh well, by the time you think about paying for a funeral and all the rest of that, I think it needs to be 15.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Look, we'll start at the 15 there. You do have flexibility with your level of cover as well. So if at any time you hold it, you wanted to reduce the level of cover, you no longer saw the need, or you wanted to keep it affordable, you can do so by giving us a call.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK, not a problem.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK. But for $15,000 of cover, it comes out to be a fortnightly premium of $77.94. OK, How is that one sounding there?
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK, well, that's not too bad.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So I'll convert it over monthly with 26 fortnights, 52 weeks, 12 months. It it's not exactly, you know, double. So the monthly premium is $168.88.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : That's 100 and $155 a month or something, isn't it? Right.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : It is the same amount that you end up paying over the space of a year.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, not a problem.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Now that's for that's for. That's a funeral. What about if I went to life insurance instead?
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, no worries. I'll open that one up. So life insurance does work a little bit differently. So there's eight yes or no health questions that we take you through just to confirm your eligibility, of course. Umm, and if you're successful, it covers you immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing that's not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep, right, right. Yep. Not a problem. I'm not wanting to do that. I like like too much.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now with the life in of course, of course that's good to hear.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but yeah, uh, that, that is the only thing that's not covered just in the 1st 13 months, OK, with life insurance, umm, it pays out if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday, at which point the policy ends.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK, no problem. Yep.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Now with the terminally ill advanced payment on life cover, it means if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, that's when we can pay the the money out to you whilst you're still living.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Right. Yep.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, now you can choose between 10 and 200,000 on the life insurance.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : What sort of level of cover were you looking at there?
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Oh my God. I don't know, Maybe 100.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months Diane?
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : I've never smoked.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect, nice healthy life choice.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Easy on the wallet as well, but that does make an impact on the premiums of course.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So $400,000 of life insurance, it comes out to be $151.39 per fortnight. OK.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Alright, OK.
[6 minutes][Agent] : Now, if you're looking at $15,000 there with the funeral, if we were to drop that down to give you an idea of something kind of similar in benefit amount, for $20,000 of life insurance, it comes out to be $30.28 per fortnight.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that sounds more feasible.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. And you're happy to leave that at the 20,000 then?
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK, perfect. Now, what we include as well is a free online legal will. It's valued at $160.00 with each policy. Do you happen to have a will arranged at this stage?
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : No, I haven't.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. So that can help you out there. Umm, it's done through a company called Safe Will.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I know it as well. Yep.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : They're backed by a team of OK perfect. Yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So it gives you the chance to set that up through their online platform there, OK, We include that with the policy documents. Now on the life insurance, your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year, OK?
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : To give you an indication though, if you made no changes to the policy, your premium next year would increase to $32.40 and then to $34.67 the next year, just to give you a bit of an idea on that increase.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : And can you can. Can I pay the this insurance annually?
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, yes, you can.
[7 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Excellent. Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So yes, yes, fortnightly, monthly, annually.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : It's the same amount that you end up paying over a year, but yeah, that's definitely an option.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So the annual premium for that one, the 20,000, would be $787.24. OK umm, you can also find information so.
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Right now does that cover, does that cover I, I suppose it doesn't cover any sort of travel or anything like that. OK, fine.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Uh, no, so this, it just, it just pays out if you were to pass away, uh, during the term of the policy.
[7 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yes, not a problem. Thank you.
[7 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK. Now, uh, with that premium structure and those indications I gave, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. OK, Now, if that one's sounding suitable, the next step is just to take you through those health questions to confirm you are eligible for the cover.
[7 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, OK.
[8 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Your e-mail address is malad@live.com dot AU.

That coverage will still begin straight away and we can get all your documents sent out to you.

[12 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Umm, I'll have a couple of questions throughout. Once we accept that the policy will be in place and we'll get all the documentation sent out to you. It does take me a few minutes to get through, so just say the warning while I read this out, OK?
