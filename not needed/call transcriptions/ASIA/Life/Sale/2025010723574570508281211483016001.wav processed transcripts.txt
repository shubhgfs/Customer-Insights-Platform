[21 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much, Carrie.
[21 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Understand completely.
[21 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you so much. I'll accept that declaration for you now. And just keeping an eye out for your document, you should receive that e-mail shortly. And then there's hard copy documents in the mail in the next three to five business days.
[21 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[22 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Missy, What I'll do now is I'll be able to pop you on a quick hold and then transfer you through to our support team so they can note down your daughter as the beneficiary on your policy.
[22 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[22 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : But thank you as well for your time carrying choosing Australian seniors. Any questions for me before I transfer you through?
[22 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : No, be fine. Thank you.
[22 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : No worries. Thank you for your time. I'll put you on a quick hold.
[22 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK. Thank you.
[22 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK. Hello there.
[24 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm still here.
[24 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much for your patience. I have Brooke here. She's going to assist you with letting Daniel's daughter as the beneficiaries. And I've let her know we've already done a full ID check or contact details confirmed.
[24 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK. Thanks very much, Mary.
[24 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much. No worries. Thank you. Bye.
[24 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Thank you. Bye.
