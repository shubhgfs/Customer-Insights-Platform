So umm, you said you were looking at life insurance.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So, umm, I've seen since your last inquiry with us. Umm, do you have anything in place since or not yet?
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Well, no, but I, I do have a life insurance component in my super and it's, it's just getting so expensive. And yeah. And I've just been putting it off and putting it off doing anything about it and it, and my, the one in my super is just gonna keep going up every year Cos that's the, the, the way that that is. It's dearer than the, the normal ones. So yeah.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, All right then, of course. So, umm, hopefully we can find some more feasible. So were you umm, considering to have a postal one yourself or is that to replace or maybe to have as as an addition to Marie?
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No, it's to replace it. If I, if I want to go with it, I would cancel the one that I've got on my life insurance. I'm sorry.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : I see. OK. All right.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : I'm like, yeah, I wouldn't need to.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : And and then can fund balance there for you for for you and you retire is that is that sort of what you're at the moment? Yeah.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Well, no, the Super is for a retirement, but there is a life insurance component to the Super that that just. Yeah, that's not, yeah, it's, it's only if something happens to me and then my beneficiaries get looked after.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yes, I understand. So you're thinking of potentially replacing the insurance within super, uh, to, to have something that is outside of it for yourself personally. So that way you can keep the Super fund balance for your retirement. Is that what you're after?
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes. Oh, yeah. That's correct. Yeah, that's that's correct. But also hopefully it's it's it's way cheaper. Yeah.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : That's what I was saying OK, well let's take a look memory there. So So what our senior is life insurance a designer do is to provide the financial protection after your family it's through a lump sum payout the event that you passed away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. So you can choose cover between $10,000 ranging up to 200,000 to insure yourself. And you could also nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated account as well. All right.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Mm Hmm. Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : So once in, once in place, if death was due to an accident, your chosen benefit amount will be triple. So there's a triple payout included within the policy for accidental death.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so I certainly hope that won't happen, but it is included with the cover. And we also, umm, have an advanced payment component within the policy to, to assist your family with funeral expenses.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So in the event that you pass away, umm, your family can request for 20% from the policy first to assist them with the funds to use towards funeral expenses whilst the rest of the claim is being processed.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, uh, it's very easy to go through with us and Marie. So you don't have to go through anything else, umm, outside of the phone call.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So no physical medical checks or blood tests to send in. We simply take you through some health questions.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm. Mm hmm.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So there's nine questions in total purely about your health if you are accepted. And once you commence it, you'll be covered immediately for deaths to do any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. Yeah. So full protection can commence from day one except for suicide.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So let's take a look at a cover amount that Marie. So, you know, you can look into levels from 10,000 up to $200,000. You can start off anywhere that you're comfortable with and would be happy to manage at the time as well. Umm, So if something were to happen to you then Marie, umm, what would you like to cover to be used against anything specific or particular? Yeah. OK.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK, well, my benefi, my my beneficiary is my husband and probably he would probably need to have some home help, you know, like cooking, cleaning, that sort of stuff because I do all for him.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, I see. That sounds. Yeah.
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, so it's really was done.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So Yep to so it's really, so I guess to umm, leave it behind for your husband so that way he can maintain his lifestyle for a while if something did happen to you through the term, which is understand of course.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Alright so umm, so how so between 10,000 and $200,000. Great. How much would you like me to quote you on 1st?
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK, I think we'll go with the 200,000 because the one that's in my life insurance, sorry, in my superannuation is actually much higher than that. So and he, he doesn't probably need more than 200 anyway if something was to happen to me. So, so yeah, 200 thou.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, alright, OK. So to quote you on 200,000, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Thank you then, Marie. OK. And while that leads up on the screen, uh, what's also included within the cover, There is a terminally ill advanced payments benefit. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can pay you out to benefit a man in full. And that could be used towards anything, whether it be to set up your husband first or to help use it towards medical expenses, that is up to you. OK, Yeah.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : No, yes, right.
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Did you have any questions so far for me, For me there, Ray, Thank you.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : That's all good.
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : I'm I'm I'm clear on.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So if you're all right. So thank you for that. So if you're accepted based on your health assessment to insure yourself for 200,000, which could triple the $600,000 for accidental death, your fault 90 premium is $230.99.
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, $230.99 per fortnight.
[8 minutes][Agent] : Yep, correct.
[8 minutes][Customer] : Oh, OK, OK, OK. That actually is a lot more than what I'm paying. That's 40.
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : I see how much how much you are paying at the moment.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : It's it's about 400. Well, it's actually roughly the same. It's about 460 something dollars a month. So it's actually roughly the same times 2. Yes yeah, it's roughly the same Yeah, I have more more cover, you know, like the payouts way higher.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : MMM.
[8 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : It's almost 200 higher. It's almost 200,000 higher.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Ah, I see. Ah, so you're covered for about 400.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, 300 and something. I I can't remember the exact speaker. It's 300 and something.
[8 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, alright, that's, that's what I'm saying. Well then, umm, you, you must have started that, uh, insurance policy in the fund a while back, is that right?
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK, it I did.
[9 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yes. OK how long are we talking roughly?
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. 1515 years, maybe 20.
[9 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah.
[9 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : I can't remember company for a long time.
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So so and said, well, that's good to hear that you set it up a while back. At the time, Marie, you would have been that much younger of course as well. So the way that our premium, the way that our premiums are calculated, it is basing off your details now starting a new policy. So your age plays a role in the amount of premiums you pay from the start as well.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So, so this quote is based off your age being 67, umm, your lifestyle at the moment, your umm, umm, sum insured, uh, your gender there as well. And it is basically health as well. So, so with your details now, this is, this is what we C this is the amount that we can insure you for if you're starting on a new policy with us, if you're accepted. So sometimes when comparing against the policy that would or was organized, you know, 10/15/20 years back, you could be on a different right back then you could be on a different policy. So it all depends on, you know, the insurer and when you took it out and how you took it out as well. So if you're looking at something person outside of super for yourself, the Marine you're wanting to, I guess, umm, reduce your overall cost, the result, then you could also consider lowering or signing off on a lower amount ensure yourself later on in life.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because if you're wanting the, if you're wanting the, yeah, so for, so this is the maximum benefit that we can offer you and that's for 200,000. Uh, it does work out to be $230.99 per fortnight. So, umm, otherwise you can break, umm, the $200,000 into smaller amounts. So I know that from the last time that we spoke to you back in 2022, we went through $50,000 with you at that time.
[11 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Did we? OK, I couldn't remember that. Yeah. All right. Well, why don't we sort of go, yeah, 'cause see, my husband's getting older now and, and if something was to happen to me, I'd, he, he would need to pay people to come in and do some support.
[11 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. Yeah, yeah.
[11 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : And.
[11 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So from, from the sounds of it, then then, yeah, sounds like you're umm, like you need that those funds to help take care of husband, uh, if anything does happen, right.
[11 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : But that's why I'll yes, yeah, yeah.
[11 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, I get that there is all that. There's also and, and also another also you, you, you get first summary.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Well, why don't we look at maybe say 100 and 100,000?
[11 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yes.
[11 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK, Go half by 100,000.
[11 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : If you look at because that should be half of that in. So for $100,000, it's $115.50 per fortnight. And let's say, and let's say you do start off on that amount 1st and once the cover commences further than track memory, if you can manage more, you can apply to take out additional cover as well to make up to 200,000.
[12 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So it is subject to your age and legibility. And as long as you're not exceeding $200,000 all up, so you can't, as mentioned, you can't break up and just a bit the result. And if you need more cover as you go, you can apply for an additional cover for more, which is subject to your age and legibility.
[12 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Of course, yeah.
[12 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Now what sort of increases happen each year like say every year do you have have, how does that premium change the payment?
[12 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So look, yeah. So I'll take you through to the next part. The Marissa, your premium is stepped, uh, which means it will increase each year. And to show you location, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be 1/23/58 per fortnight. So that's going from 1:15 fifty this year to roughly 12358 next year. So that's different. So let's take a look.
[13 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah, $8.08 per fortnight. So that's $16.00 a month.
[13 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Difference of dollars and items going from this year to next year, roughly, yeah.
[13 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just not quite sure what I'm, I'm not going to have to have a look at the increases on my on my existing one to see whether I think they actually are higher than. But yeah.

[27 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. That's when you have, that's when you have, you have a good one. Yeah.
[27 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Alright, well, yeah, alright. I'm I'm just still going to have to G discuss this with my husband and he's not here at the moment, so I can't go through that with him. But I'm, I'm just thinking if we were to do it monthly and to nominate a date, you know, obviously I wanna go through the paperwork as well. Let me see.
[27 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So again, anywhere between 102 minutes, that's the level of coverage we provide. So that's the amount that you've been None.
[27 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Probably, yeah, probably in the earlier months. Yeah, probably the. Make it the 13th, the 13th of the month.
[28 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, so that does fall within the, umm, 30 days. So if you do 13th of February, that can be the first collection day and you'll be on the 13th of each month.
[28 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[28 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's all. Yeah, yeah. So, so I've got to, Yep. So, uh, now that you've been accepted then Marie of course, and Yep, I can forward you out the, uh, the general quote to your e-mail address first, umm, as an alternative option, because you've been approved through as well, then I can offer you the full cover and have you covered whilst you were doing everything as well. Umm, and that's when you'll receive your postal copy of your documents as well, sent to your home address for you to review. So, uh, the postal copy generally takes two to five working days to come out.

That way you can go through that with your husband as well, review it. Umm, we note down that our first collection date to be a 13th of February 2025.

So there's no surcharges in either account. Umm, so which? Which preferred account did you want to use for the direct debit?
[29 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. OK. So it will go. OK.
