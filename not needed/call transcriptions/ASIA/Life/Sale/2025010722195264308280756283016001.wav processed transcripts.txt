[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Well, that's so. Yeah.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : This is mario_lupeska@yahoo.com beautiful. Thanks. For that I'll. Quickly explain to you how the cover works and, then we'll take you through these eight questions OK. NOW What we do is we pay the money out of the lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. But it's saying that if you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. OK.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, so if you take Touchwood, touch that if it.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : I don't mind that.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : But if you take it out today, let's say tomorrow you pass it in a car accident or a heart attack, for example, Touchwood, you're gonna be cut for those kind of things straight away. OK, now there's also a terminally ill advanced payment included as well. Hopefully you'll never have to use this Marina. But what it means that at any time you hold the policy, if you would diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by specialized medical practitioner in this case we'll pay out 100% of the life insurance benefit amount to you while you actually live. OK? So you can use that money for whatever you need. OK.
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. Hopefully I'm not.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : And just one more thing we got.
[6 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Hopefully I won't. I won't get that.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, what was that exactly? Yeah, hopefully you don't have to use that at all. Uh, just one more thing in regards to premium. You might know this already, but your premium is step, which is will increase each year. I'll give you an example. As an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be, uh, $61.57 a fortnight. So it's gone up by roughly $4.00.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : But we do let you know roughly 4 weeks prior to the policy anniversary date, uh, of what the new premium would be. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. And like I see you can also try to reduce the level of coverage in time as well.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, any questions so far? Is it all sounding straightforward?
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : So after like my kids gonna have like, completely access to all this. Yes.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So the the you mean the money?
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. I have to go.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So what happens is you choose who you want the money to go to and we pay the money out out to them.
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK.
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, so does it make sense?
[7 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm, hmm.
[7 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So if you choose it, you know, let's say you choose two of your children and you want them to have 5050, then we pay out, for example, 40,040 thousand directly to them. OK. And if they use the money however they want, does that make sense?
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, OK, OK. Yes.
[8 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. So, umm, that's, that's obviously something that you need to do. It's a form I'll send out as well. You just need to, that's the only thing you need to fill out and send it back.
