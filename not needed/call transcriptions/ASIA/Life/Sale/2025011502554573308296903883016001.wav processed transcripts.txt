[1 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it is.
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK. And what what made you look into have you got one in place at the moment or or not yet?
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I don't have life insurance. And it's only 'cause I saw the ad on the TV, because I assumed, because I've just turned 70, I assume most people won't give you life insurance. But when it said seniors up to 79, I thought, oh, I'll give you a call. Just sit in my face.
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, let's see what options we have. OK, let's, let's, I'll take you through it, walk you through it and go through the options.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So basically with strengthening is our life insurance cover is designed to provide financial protection.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : It's there for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before you're ready 5th birthday.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : When the policy ends, you can choose cover between 10,000 up to 200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their known end benefit amount. If death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep. Yep.
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : We also include an advanced payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs and or any other final expenses at the time, of course.
[2 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sounds good. Well, I put in, yeah, I put in 150,000 because I have three children. So 50,000 each to to another will contribute no doubt to my funeral, et cetera.
[2 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, so, so OK, OK, fair enough. OK, so that's fine. So now if you take that as an example 150 there, that'd be a level of cover, OK, it's got there. Now should you pass away due to an accident, right, we're paying out 450,000, OK.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.
[3 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : And if you work out what 20% of your, of your $150,000 is that work that to be should know this, uh, 150,000 * 20%. So that's 30,000. That's right.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 30 thou, yes, yes, right.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So 30,000 would be, uh, the amounts that your family members can get access to those funds quite immediate to pay to the upfront fees for funeral costs and so forth. OK. So that's absolutely ties them together. Now the process to apply is easy.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, Yep.
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : We just ask you only eight yes or no questions relating to your house over the phone to see if you are approved.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Alright.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : If you are accepted and once you commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Well, I'm hoping to stick around for quite some time.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, good.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : I'm working full time still.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Oh, well, fantastic, excellent. Also in addition to that, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So that would mean in the unfortunate situation where you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to lead by a specialized medical practitioner will pay out your claim in full into your own hands money.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Right, Right, right.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : You could use the medical costs to ensure you if your best care possible. Yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : I was just gonna say, my God, if I had a terminal illness, it'd probably cost that much just to treat it.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So it's there for you for Peace of Mind as well.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Alright, great.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, any questions so far before we head towards the options?
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No, it all sounds very good.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. Fantastic. All right. And so to begin with, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? OK.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : No, not, not at all. I don't smoke.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic. So Susan, you, you, as you know, you can select between 10,000 to 200,000. So I'll select the 150 for you if you like.
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, thank you.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : 200 a fortnight. Oh my goodness.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So on that level there, you'd be paying an amount of $212.23 a fortnight, which is $105.12 a week is what you're paying. Yes, Yeah.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : It's quite a bit, isn't it?
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Well, it's a couple of things to keep in mind here. It's age, it's benefit amounts selected.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Umm, gender is a factor as well.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so these are factors that you know, contribute to, you know, the pricing.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. Yep.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, but for example, so the idea that you wanted to leave equal amounts behind, is that what you were suggesting?
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's what I thought.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : They're from the right.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that's right.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, So even if you were to consider you've got 3 three children you run to, maybe if you were to consider even 90,000 say, alright, so that way you can leave buying I suppose 30,000 each, right? Umm, you'd be looking at paying $127.34 a fortnight, which now looks like more like $63.67 a week.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's more manageable, isn't it? What about 120,000? What would that be?
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yes, 120,000. So let's look at that level there that, uh, would work out to be $169.79 a four nights, which is $84.90 a week on that level there. Is that something that you may consider the 120?
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Well, I'm thinking about it.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Hmm Yep.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : You see, at the moment it's not a problem because I'm working full time, but I don't plan on working up 'til 80 or anything, you know, so.
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, fair enough.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so, so, and look, can I just say that Susan, uh, sorry Suzanne, umm, even if you were to take out the 1:20 at the moment, and let's say down the track, you know, you find that it's, it becomes uncomfortable for you to pay, umm, you can apply to reduce your level of cover that point in time anyway, OK?
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Gosh.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : That's another way you could be reducing your premium, so to speak. OK.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Alright. Can you can you give me the cost for 100,000?
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Certainly. So if you choose 100,000, the costing would be $141.49 a fortnight. So therefore you'd be looking at $70.60 a week. Out of these these options so far, what would you say that you'd be leaning towards so far?
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. I'm thinking a 100 and trying to keep it in my mind.
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : The 120 is $169.79.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : 141A fortnight for 100,000 and what was 120,000 $30 more? Yeah, I'm probably leaning towards 100,000 I suppose.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, We can leave it there for you. So let's have a look here. So 100, yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : What's the situation if I if I decide to to go down, you know, when I stop working full time, I might decide that I it's too much.
[8 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. So you can take it down. So you can go from 100,000, you can go down to any increments go up or down by 10,000.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So your next one down will be 90, then 80 and so forth. All right.
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So I suppose at that point in time you can weigh up what your budget would be at that point in time.
[8 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[8 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : And you can, you know, apply to reduce your level of cover down to something more comfortable for you if you like.
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : OK, alright.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, All right. Now the couple things that we do for you too, umm, first of all, we now provide you with a, a free online legal will to the value of $150.00 of each policy. Have you organized one or does it require banking?
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : I did one years and years ago. Yeah. Well, mm, hmm. Yeah.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, now what we're providing you with now at the moment, this is something that, so you know, it's provided through Safe Will and Safe Will is an online platform that allows you the freedom to write your will simply and securely without hidden fees, those huge financial costs.
