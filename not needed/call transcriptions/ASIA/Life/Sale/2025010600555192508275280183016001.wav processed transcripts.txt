Alright, well, alright, let me just take a look here for you Andrew. I'll go through and let you know how this PO policy works and then you can let me know any questions along the way. OK? So look, seniors life insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. Now, uh, sorry, I'll say that again. Seniors Life Insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday. When the policy ends, you can choose cover between $10,000 up to $200,000 and nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the nominated benefit amount. If you pass away due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple. We also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : I how how old you have to be to be a senior?
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep, Yeah. So look, at least for our seniors life insurance, you can apply. Australian residence age between 45 and 79 can apply.

[4 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : That's OK, no worries. And do you, do you usually, are you usually the one to take care of all your finances and everything or do you have someone that helps you or do you, do you do everything yourself?
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I get my.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : There just you OK, No worries. That's all good then. OK, we'll continue forward. Look, it's easy to apply. We just ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you are approved and if you are accepted and once you commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. Now in addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment including the cover. If you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can pay your benefit amount in full to help with medical costs to ensure you receive the best care possible. Do you have any questions? So far? No. OK, let me know if you have anything. But look, let's go through a quote together. To begin with. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yep. OK, right, OK, that's alright. Yeah. So you've had a, you've had a cig. You, you're, you uh, you had a cigarette in the last 12 months, is that correct?

[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. Alright. And then, uh, next question here, let me have a look that with me. OK, so keeping in mind the level of cover ranges from $10,000 up to $200,000. What benefit amount would you like to look at first?
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : It would cost 200 days.
[6 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : $200,000 OK. So Andrew, for $200,000 of cover, the premium will be $186.29 per fortnight. Is that suitable for you or do you need less cover?
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : I'm a bit less than that now. I'm only on the pension.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. That's all good. Well, look, we can take a lower figure if you'd like. Do you have a budget in mind, Andrew?
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Not really. I've never looked into it. But then, but then how's the book? Like if before I die and the daughter gets the money, then you have to spend it on the funeral?
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, No, no. So this is this is life insurance here. It's just a direct deposit of how much the benefit amount is to your daughter and she can use it for whatever she'd like and as well as funeral expenses for yourself. OK. But yeah, do you do you have a you, you don't have like a budget in mind? How much do you think you can afford per fortnight?
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : No, I I know. Yeah, there's no everything. I'm there.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : And then even I'm not there. How much are they one lady do order? She's not. She don't die on the order. Really.
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Right, right. OK, Well, look, we can look at other figures here. How much would you like to leave you behind for your daughter if 200 isn't available?
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : We'll get 10,000.
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : If 200 is a bit too much, 200,000, sorry, $10,000, That's the lowest I can offer here. So for $10,000 of cover, the premium will be $9.31 per fortnight.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No, I would have bet 20,000.
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So for $20,000 of cover, the premium will be $18.63 per fortnight.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : That would be like $20, wouldn't it?
[8 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yep, No worries. Yeah. Is that looking suitable there for you? OK, no worries at all. Then let me just take a look here for you. I'll let you know as well.
