[0 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[1 seconds][Agent] : Hi, my name's Joel. I'm calling from the Australian seniors. I was looking to speak with Samuel.
[8 seconds][Customer] : I think what's me is that waiting for him because he couldn't. He couldn't speak English and he can't understand English at all.
[11 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, OK, sure.
[16 seconds][Customer] : But I can't do any insurance for him with my uncle.
[21 seconds][Agent] : OK. I got you. Yeah, no problem. In that case, you're actually the one I wanted to speak to. Thank you for that. Umm, yeah, I was just following up on your online inquiry to get some quotes for life insurance. Umm, just have to say all that calls are recorded. Any advice provided is general in nature.
[21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35 seconds][Agent] : May not be suitable to your situation. And just to make sure I do have his details correctly in front of me, can you please confirm his name and date of birth? Yeah. Yep.
[45 seconds][Customer] : Samuel U25 and the date of birth is the end of the 9th 1951.
[54 seconds][Agent] : That's the one, thanks very much. And he is a male Australian residents, correct?
[58 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[59 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, thank you for that. And if you don't mind me asking, what's made you look at getting quotes for your uncle today?
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : What is that again? What is that again?
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Just asking, what's made you enquire about life insurance for your uncle?
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : What's, what's the life insurance for you talking about? Yeah, just in case something happened to him.
[1 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : No, I just mean like, OK, I get you. That's fair.
[1 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Not a problem. Look, I won't take much of your time.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Finance things or funerals and things like that.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, I got you.
[1 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : It's too expensive, but yeah, pick up money too. I mean, that is something happened to him.
[1 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : I get you. That's fair. No problem at all.
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Umm, Now, I just wanna make sure I give you the correct information because we received an inquiry for life insurance. Umm, but were you looking specifically at covering the cost of a funeral, or were you looking at, umm, leaving money behind for the family if he passes away? Both. Sure.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, both please, if you if we can.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. Not a problem. Hello, quickly bring up some quotes for the life insurance, umm, just while I do that. I'll give you a bit of an explanation on how the policy works. But uh, yeah, by all means, if you have any questions please feel free to ask.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : It's umm, basically with the life cover. It is very straightforward. So the policy is designed to provide financial protection for his loved ones. Do a lump sum payment if he was to pass away, uh, before his 85th birthday when the policy ends. So essentially he can choose an amount he'd like to be insured for. He can nominate up to five people as beneficiaries and we'll pay that money directly to them when the time comes.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Now it is a worldwide color, so if he does travel, he will be covered overseas.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Uh, the policy that, yeah, it does payout triple if you was to pass away due to an accident.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So we pay three times in that case, and it also includes an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount just to help out with funeral costs or any other final expenses at that time.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, the application process is very simple. It's basically just eight yes or no questions relating to his health in order to apply. And then that way if he is accepted and of course, once he decides to commence the policy, he will be covered immediately for death due to any cause.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : The only. Yeah, the only thing not covered is just suicide in the 1st 13 months. There is also a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover, which means that if he was diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialised medical practitioner, in that case we would pay out his claim in full while he's living. Now the cover that I can quote you on it starts at $10,000 up to a maximum of $200,000. Uh, looks like on our website you're looking at a quote for the 150,000.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Perfect.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : I just click on that.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Oh OK, that's fine. I can look at a few different amounts, that's no problem. Umm, just have to confirm. Has he had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Never.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : No, he never smoking twice.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : That's the way. Good health choice.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, well starting with the 150, just to give you an example, if you're looking at a cover of 150,000, it would work out to be a fortnightly premium of $375.71. Yep. But it does work on a linear price structure.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, Yep.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So what I mean by that if you drop it down to 100,000, that would cut the price down by 1/3. So 100,000 would be $250.47 per fortnight, or if you earn $50,000 it would be $125.24 per fortnight.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : About $63 a week roughly. You know, I understand this is obviously something you'd have to have a talk to him about, but does that sound like something that would suit his situation or what are your thoughts?
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I can. I can call for the 100.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. Look, in this situation, so you mentioned that your uncle doesn't speak English. Umm, we would.
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : No, we can.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. That that's the thing. We would actually have to speak to him in order to run through the health and lifestyle questions. Umm, we we do have an interpreter service available that we could organize. What language does he speak?
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : The problem with he's got a hearing problem too.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : All right, Yeah.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : He's got all this H problem, but with his health itself. It's not really a person. He doesn't have blood pressure or heart problem or things like that.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, Gotcha.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : But that's the only problem with him is a bit of a understanding language.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : You know that even he writing our own language, he find write or read.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Right. OK. Alright. Right. OK.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : And sometime, sometime I do the interpreter to do things on the phone and interpreter in the court because he lost his temper with somebody keep asking questions. That's the problem.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, I got you. Fair enough. Yeah.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : But I'm the one I'm doing the nominee for him in everything, the Centrelink or anything like that.
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, OK.
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : I normally need to do everything for him and updating him when we keep asking questions and whatever. He doesn't have a family or anything.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Umm, I get you, right? OK, fair enough.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : He either wants to look after him and everything.
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : So that's why.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Umm, yeah. Look, I mean, in that situation, I'm afraid it does make it a bit tough to actually get the, the life insurance organized because we can actually only set it up through the person who's insured.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : So what? So what's about the expenses, insurance?
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : However, umm, we do have another type of insurance that you can organize for him if that's the way you wanted to go call their funeral, you know? Yeah, sure.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Is that got a problem?
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : I can give you, umm, no, with that one, you can actually organize the funeral insurance for him. Umm, I'll give you an example of how that one works. I'll bring up some quotes as well.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Now basically with the funeral cover, so this one, it's similar to the life insurance. It is designed to provide, uh, cash benefit of up to $15,000 that gets paid directly to his nominated beneficiaries when he does pass away.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so essentially you can choose an amount you'd like to be insured for. Uh, we'll pay that money directly to the beneficiaries when the time comes. This one's more designed to help out with the upfront cost of organizing a funeral.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Of course.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Uh, your family can use that money however you need, whatever expenses may occur, and it generally gets paid out within 24 to 48 hours of the claims team receiving that completed documentation.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Umm, just so they'll have access to that money as quickly as possible now.
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So this one pays out triple if you were to pass away due to an accident.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So we would pay three times in that case. But it also pays out triple if he was to suffer an accidental serious injury.
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Yep.
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So if he did suffer an accidental serious injury before the policy anniversary following his 75th birthday, in that case, we would pay out three times what he was covered for directly to him.
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, it's not just funeral cover. There is a living cover in there as well. Now this one's guaranteed acceptance, so there's no medical checks or health questions.
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : The cover is open to all Australian residents aged between 40 and 79.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Now the important part to keep in mind is that for the 1st 12 months, it would be covered against accidental death and accidental serious injury only. Then after that first 12 months, then he'd become for death due to any cause at all, including an accident.
[8 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Uh, in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit included, which means that after holding his policy for 12 months, if he was first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner. In that case, we would pay out his claim in full while he's living.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Now, the cover does range from $3000 up to a maximum of $15,000. Umm, what amount would you like me to quote you on?
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Call right up to 15,000. Yep.
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Sure, let's have a look at the 15.
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, now just quickly while I update that.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Because funeral expenses not, not that cheap.
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Sure, now fair enough. This day and age, everything's a bit up there. That's great.
[9 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Now they're very expensive.
[9 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, tell me about it. Alright, I'll just quickly update that.
[9 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[9 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so the premiums are designed to stay the same as he gets older and then once he goes on to reach the age of 85, the premiums stop altogether Umm and at 85 we do apply a 25% bonus cover onto the policy. So basically you'll be covered for an extra 25% of the benefit amount, but he will no longer have to pay for it. Then on the flip side of that coin, once he does reach the age of 85, he can elect to end his cover. So basically he can cash it out if he wants to and we will pay him out 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. That's just an option, of course.
[9 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[10 minutes][Agent] : To give you an example, if you're looking at a cover of $15,000, which would triple to 45,000, accidental works out to be a fortnightly premium of $91.32.
[10 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So it's roughly about $45 per week.
[10 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : And as I mentioned, the premiums are designed to stay the same as he gets older. Umm, yeah. Just to make it a bit easier to budget and plan for the future.
[10 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep. Yeah. I think I'll take, I'll take that insurance.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So does that set OK The, uh, the funeral?
[10 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[10 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. Now I just want to make sure I'm following the correct process and doing the right thing by you. So a bit earlier on in the call when I asked if you were looking at covering funeral expenses or leaving money behind for the family and you mentioned both, Did you mean you're looking at both types of insurances? Is that what you meant?
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, for the funeral. OK, So that's the main thing. You perfect? Yeah, I get you. That's fair. No worries.
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : But I really need something for especially for the funeral Cos I don't want to run around looking for money to finance his funeral if something happen to him because he doesn't have a a wife or anything to help.
[11 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : That's the thing. I Yeah. OK.
[11 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : No one is going to be something and running around.
[11 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I get you.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's why I wanna.
[11 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine.
[11 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : But can he do another insurance like the funeral plus another one just like, as you said, the money for family or something like that?
[11 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Umm, that's the, that's the thing.
[11 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[11 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : I mean, with the, with the life insurance, that's the one where we would have to speak to him to actually set it up. However, the funeral, yeah, the funeral cover you can organize for him. But just to let you know, I mean, there's nothing stopping you from taking out multiple policies with different companies.
[11 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's the problem, yeah.
[11 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Umm, like with us, we just pay out whatever policy he has with us. So hypothetically, if you took out a funeral policy with us and if you wanted to take out another one with another company just to have a higher amount, umm, you're more than welcome to to look into that. You can always apply to do that subject to eligibility.
[11 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll be, I'll be able to go for that one now.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, Sure. Yeah. OK.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : For now and now, yeah, because some instability support pension.
[11 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : No problem. Oh, OK, I get you. Sure.
[12 minutes][Customer] : So it's one every fortnight.
[12 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK. Now just to make sure I'm doing the right thing by you. So initially, just for the record, we did receive an inquiry about life insurance, but it was actually the funeral insurance you were worried about. Is that right?
[12 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Mainly the shipments, yeah.
[12 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure, your insurance, yeah that's fine, no problem at all. All right well, what I'll do umm, so just to give you the full picture if you're happy with that so far, what we do from here is we organize to send you out all the policy documentation for you to have a read through and review. Now we do send out 2 copies.
[12 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[12 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so we post out a hard copy which you should receive in about two to five business days, but we also e-mail a copy which should arrive roughly in about 10 to 15 minutes as well. So you can have a read through today.

[13 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[13 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Umm, yeah, you can schedule it for today. Yeah, absolutely. That's fine.
[13 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : And then I'll do like every fortnight payment because he's on a central link payment and he's he's, he's got his payment today. So it's better to start it.

If cover ends prior to age 85, no benefit is payable and there is no refund of premiums after the cooling off. If cover continues beyond age 85, the life insured will receive an additional 25% of bonus cover from that date and you will not be required to pay any further premiums. The bonus cover is not paid if the early cash out option has been taken out. Cover for each life insured ends on the day prior to their 100th birthday. We will pay the funeral benefit and bonus cover for the life insured. At this point your total premium for your first year of cover is $91.32 per fortnight. Your premiums are level which means they are designed to stay consistent year on year and will only change if you alter your cover or the insurer adjust the premium rates applying to your policy. The insurer can only make a change if it is applied consistently of across all policyholders. You may pay more in premiums than the benefit amount over the life of the policy. Included in your premium is an amount payable to Australian Seniors Insurance Agency of between 32% and 54%, calculated on a level basis over the life of the policy. Your premium will be debited from your credit card which you authorised to debit from and have provided to us.

[28 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : If you're happy with that, it's pretty simple process.
[28 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[28 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Uh, basically all I have to do is just quickly run you through those eight health questions.
[28 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[28 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Uh, so we can get you approved. Once you're approved, I'll organize to send you out all the documentation so that you can take some time to review it in your own time. Uh, but either way, there's no upfront payments. Umm, so you don't have to pay anything today. You can choose whatever day in the future you prefer. Now I'm just going to quickly close this off and jump into your profile. It won't be 1 moment, OK?
[28 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : I just wanna make sure I've got everything correct for your uncle first, just before that gets finalized. Yeah, that's all done. OK Alright, so just while I update the quote for your profile, just quickly refresh your memory on the life insurance in case I missed any part of it at the start. Umm, so the life insurance, that's very straightforward. Essentially it's designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones to a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. Essentially choose the amount you'd like to be insured for. Uh, you nominate up to five people as beneficiaries and we'll pay that directly to them when the time comes.
[29 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, uh huh. Yep.
[29 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : So it does pay a lump sum payment to your beneficiaries if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends now to cover. So it does pay out triple if you were to pass away due to an accident. Umm, it also includes an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amounts to help out with funeral costs or any other final expenses at that time.
[29 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[29 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Now the application process is just eight yes or no questions relating to your health in order to apply then that way if you are accepted, and of course once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause at all. The only thing not covered? Umm, it's just suicide in the 1st 13 months touch with hopefully it never comes into it. Uh, yeah, yeah, sure. And lastly, there is that terminally ill advanced payment included as well, which means that if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, in that case we would pay out your sorry. If you're diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, in that case, we would pay out your claim in full while you're living. Just to reconfirm that price for yourself and your husband, $100,000 each works out to be $244.09 per fortnight. Yeah, yeah.
[30 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's OK.
[30 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So the other part to keep in mind in regards to the premium, so your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year.
[30 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[30 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I've got a projection here, so I'll just give you an indication of what that looks like.
[30 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yeah.
[30 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Uh, just to see here as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy next year, the fortnightly premium for the two of you would be $261.18. Sure.
[30 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : That's it. Yep.
[30 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : You can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well.
[31 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[31 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Now just before I do jump into the questions, yeah, just wanna make sure I'm doing the right thing by you.
[31 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[31 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Is that all making sense for you so far?
[31 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep.

So you have been approved for our life insurance. Uh, so you are definitely eligible, which is great.
[34 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Now what that means we do from you.
[34 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Only quite a problem with the leaks.
[34 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, great. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. OK.
[34 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Only the leaks caught a problem, but the the system it's, it's a bit.
[34 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. Right here. Yeah, of course. Mm hmm.
[34 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Can I ask you a question, like if something had been like, passed away, but how long you had to wait to do the claim for because of the funeral and all that? He said.
[34 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah, fair question. Yeah, funerals need to be organized pretty quickly. That's a good point. Well, what happens is I'm. So first of all, the easiest way to do it is make sure you have your beneficiaries nominated. So in other words, with each policy, we do send out the beneficiaries form.
[34 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Context, like yeah, yeah, yeah, please.
[35 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So whenever you're ready, just fill the form out. Just letting us know who'd like to leave the money to send it back to us. It does come with a reply paid address, so you won't need a stamp or anything. Just send it back to us. US. We'll keep that on file when the time comes. Your nominated beneficiaries just have to call our claims team. They'll be assigned a claims agent who guide them through the whole process. At that point, they can request the initial payout of 20% of the benefit amount. So if you were covered for $100,000 that the advance payout would be $20,000. So they they can request that first just to help out with our funeral costs.
[35 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, OK yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[35 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : And then the wrist.

[35 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. OK. OK.
[35 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, now I forgot to mention as well, with each policy, we do actually send out a free online legal will valued at $160.00.

[36 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
