[2 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Umm, So just very briefly, because I, I know we're short on time there. Umm, what is kind of sparked your interest in the life insurance? Do you currently have cover in place when you're exploring some options? Are you new to the whole thing? Umm, who? Yeah.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm new to the whole thing, mainly just I look, I've driven trucks for 10 years and it's, I know, in fact, if you make 10 years in a truck without a major, you've done really well and I've never had a major. So it's just little things and umm family. I've got a 10 year old and a 13 year old son and a 40 year old wife. And looking at my super going, something happened to me. That's not really enough. They mean a little bit more, umm, just just general life planning. I suppose being I'm 51, I just sort of had a bit of a realization.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I'm sorry to hear. Bit of a wake up call.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : A good friend of mine got killed in a truck accident about 3 weeks for Christmas and it just sort of, umm, sort of sparked in me that I probably should look at things and make sure that, uh, things are right for the wife and the kids, you know? Umm, and it sort of did spark a thing in me and I went, oh, she's probably not. I hope it never happens. But if you go to work and don't come home, you sort of think, **** maybe the wife's not quite right. You know, I need a little bit more just to top that up.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : So it's sort of was a wake up call, a bad one, unfortunately, but we all get those in life.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, definitely.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : So it, it just sort of got me on the on the path of trying to work out sort of how much more she'd need to look after herself. Forbidden, you know, I just thought, Yep, I better get on to this.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : No, well, thank you so much for that personal background information there.
[4 minutes][Customer] : So that's alright.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and definitely that that does it's, it's enlightening to your situation, umm, for me to hear all of that. I am.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, now look, that's it.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : I do apologize that you lost a colleague, uh, for a week before Christmas there.
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : It happens unfortunately in this industry, but and through no fault of his own was the 3rd part. But that's unfortunately what we deal with now.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Oh, that's very sad.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Don't very impatient drivers, which is getting worse and worse by the day.
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : I know, I know there's some very irresponsible people and selfish people on the road, isn't there?
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Oh, look, I'd, I'd have a file of footage there that would scare the hell out of most people and people overtaking another line towards me over hills, you know, it's just madness, absolute madness. I have no respect for themselves, little and anyone else.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, exactly.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : And it, it just it's starting to scare me because it's, it's one of those that'll that'll end up being the end of something, you know, and that's what happened to my mate. But it's sort of made me sit down and think about it, But it's, it's a wake up call, unfortunately.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that is yeah, yeah. As you said, not not a good one, not a nice one, but umm, yeah. You know, sometimes, I mean, this, this is real.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : So no, but it, it makes you look at your life and think, oh jeez, maybe I need to change a few things there.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, definitely. Yeah, No, these, these real some experiences that we have, they do certainly open up your eyes and get you thinking about things. And you know what I mean? To be honest with you, we do live in a world where we kind of ensure everything in our lives but our own lives quite often.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : So Yep, Yep. Well, that's what I thought. Like we've got boat insured, house insured, contents insured, car insured, you know, everything's insured but me.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So, umm, you know, Yeah, yes, exactly.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : And I went, that's a bit crazy.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : It is a little bit crazy.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Like I'm probably the highest risk out of the lot and I'm not insured.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : And I went, oh, I haven't never done this. But anyway, look, it is what it is.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it is.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : And I'm probably guilty too. Like of every other strain. You never look at you're super enough and you then something happens and you look at it and you go, oh, well, maybe I had a little more than they're like that's not right.
[6 minutes][Agent] : Yeah.
[6 minutes][Customer] : And you sort of. Yeah, it, it wakes up. Yeah.
[6 minutes][Agent] : Well, depending on what, what stage in your life that you are with you. Yeah, 100%. That's right. If you've got mortgages to pay off.
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : And the other thing being my wife is sort of 10 1/2 years younger than me. I sort of, I keep forgetting that fact. I think, well, I'm 51, you know, I've got, I've sort of lived most of my life. And then you think, well, hang on, my wife's only 40. Crap. She's got a lot more to go yet. I better pull my finger out here and provide a bit better. So it's it's yeah, just a bit of wake up call, so.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Umm, oh, well, you know what, you sound, you sound like a real gentleman anyway. Like at least, you know, you kind of considering your wife in that way. But obviously that is that is the whole purpose of the cover here.
[6 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yeah, Yep.
[6 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : And, umm, in terms of when you're talking about like you're kind of covered a little bit with your suit, but that is also, umm, like a purpose without policy as well as just to provide that little bit of top up cover on top of the cover that you do have within your suit. Super as well. And obviously, uh, we are a provider that specializes in life cover.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So we will have different features and benefits to what you would be receiving with that super, that super cover there anyhow.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so yeah. And I thank you very much, umm for all of the personal information there. I really do appreciate that. Umm, So what I'll do now is I'll try and quickly go through the features and benefits that are specific to Australian seniors life insurance. OK. And then if we still have a few minutes after that, we can start to explore some pricing.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, so as we basically just discussed, the seniors life insurance is designed to provide that financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment there. Uh, that's if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends now you can choose cover between $10,000 up to $200,000. And I can see your web inquiry here was for the $200,000. So we'll look at that, that, that level first. Umm, but we can have a play with the levels of cover as well. It does go up and down in $10,000 increments.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep. Yep.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So we'll, we'll have a play with that If you need to umm, now with us, you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive that nominated benefit amount and uh, Robert, if your death was due to an accident, then the chosen benefit amount does actually triple. So knock on wood, that does not happen for you.
[8 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Bye.
[8 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Obviously we don't, you know, uh, proceed that to happen for any of our customers. We don't like to hear that that has happened, but that is the feature of our policy as well. So if you did have the $200,000 worth of cover there and, umm, it does sound like you work in a risky industry, but, uh, you know, if, if unfortunately something horrific like that did happen, then the benefit amount does actually triple the $600,000 for your beneficiaries. OK.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Umm, Now another feature of our policy is that we do offer an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses that may be kind of, uh, that may initially arise at the time of your passing. So basically what that means is whilst uh, the beneficiary be awaiting the claim to be processed, they can apply for the, that advance payment there of 20% of the benefit amounts just to help with those initial costs.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Umm.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : And what do I need to claim for that? Just for like the like the death certificate in there. There's the stuff with the will of that. Is that all I need to claim that? Like that's one thing I'm interested in because my, my mate who died, his funds, like his bank account, everything instantly got frozen up because of the, he was silly and didn't have a will.
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Right.
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Umm and everything got shut up and his wife was basically up with nothing until we could sort that out. So we paid the bills for them until they could get that sorted. And they're still in the process of that. So that just interests me and I've got a will, so that helps. But it's, you know, like say I didn't come home from work tomorrow. It's what my wife will need, sort of give me intermediate till she gets everything sorted, you know, just to pay for like a funeral and you know, those couple of things that you got to do. So we're just wondering what would she need to sort of claim that if something did happen?
[9 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yep. So you're right, Les. So the death certificate is one of the documents that, that, that they would require. And obviously there are other like supporting documents that would need to be provided as well.
[9 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, yeah, Yep, Yep. Which is the standard legal documents. But yeah, you need that desk that you're getting that. That'll be fine.
[10 minutes][Agent] : But yeah, absolutely. And we do have a very dedicated claims team here, uh, that try to process those claims as quickly as possible for you.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : So once they do receive all of those supporting documentation at the time of, of, you know, someone's passing, umm, it's really paid out quite quickly. I'm just trying to look through my resources just to find the exact time frame there for you.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's alright.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Just.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Look, it, it takes what it takes, but it's just, I know with my mate, like it's because he didn't have a will and he's got kids and a wife and then everything's gone Mistake. And now it's got to be sorted and like they're in a mess. They really are. And it's very painful to watch. And I'm, I'm trying to avoid that for my wife because I just. That'd be the last thing she'd made at that time. I'd have to be worried about all that sort of stuff. So that's what I'm trying to.
[10 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that's definitely, definitely no.
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : When you're when you're mourning, mourning the passing of of a loved one, the last thing you need is to be kind of burdened with all of the overwhelmed with all of those extra stresses there.
[10 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Look, it's oh, oh, look, arguing with people over who gets white and things like this, like it's just a nightmare. And I'm I'm just really buckled down now to try and make sure that my wife doesn't have to do anything like that. I'll just just scare the crap out of me. I'm watching my mate's wife and I'm thinking, oh man, this is a myth, like really is. So I'm just trying to avoid that for my wife. If everything happened, that was all you know.
[11 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, definitely. It's good that you're taking all of this into consideration. And I have to wonder whether the the gentleman that you're referring to there who passed away, whether he did have last cover in place himself or because you mentioned he didn't have a will, you said.
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Look, I yeah, look, I I'm not entirely sure. I haven't asked his wife to be honest.
[11 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course.
[11 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : We've talked about a lot of things, but not bad at the moment. But yeah, look, Dave, it's not real nice at the moment. Paul ******. She's going through hell. And it's, it's hard to watch, to be quite honest, you know, like it's, it's it does. It's just scares you. It makes you wake up to yourself to be quite honest.
[11 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, of course. That's right.
[11 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So it's, and it makes you ask questions that you would have never thought about five years ago, you know, or 12 months ago, like things like what do you need to claim if I don't come home? You know, because I would have never asked that six weeks ago, let alone 12 months ago.
[12 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yep, no, definitely.
[12 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So I, I have access to access to some information here in front of me now and, uh, basically what I can advise you at this stage, umm, is that to make a claim, you would obviously the beneficiary would contact our claims department who would outline the requirements needed and arrange for a claim form to be sent. So it sounds like a claim form would need to be completed. OK, Obviously along with the death, death certificate and other various supporting documents. OK. And then those can either be sent back by post, fax or e-mail. And once we have received all of the required documents, then we we then assess the claim. OK. After the claim has been assessed, we then notify the beneficiary of the claim decision. And if accepted, we would then make the payment as per the wishes of the policy owner. OK, Umm, but it does it is yes.
[12 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[13 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : They're the kind of legal stuff that you've got a will in place, so which is good to hear. But you, we actually do provide you with a free online legal will, which is valued at $160.00 with each policy as well. Although it sounds like you don't need that. But these are another, uh, feature that is attached to this policy as so anyway, but it's good to know that you've kind of secured yourself in that way and that is important these days.
[13 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yeah, Yep. Oh, it is.
[13 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : And it's sad as well when people pass away that you do have a lot of everybody seems to come out of the woodwork wanting to know what they're going to get and when they're going to get it.
[13 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[13 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : And you know, I, I do think that makes me really sad when I hear about that these days.
[13 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Oh, look, it does.
[13 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So you, you mentioned that earlier on and it's got me thinking about that.
[13 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : It just it.
[13 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yes, absolutely.
[13 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : It makes me angry, to be quite honest, that people get so selfish at a time when you should not be selfish at all.
[13 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : That's exactly right. Yeah, it's human behavior.
[13 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : But people do it and I don't know what's happened to society. It's gone to the toilet, I think is the problem.
[13 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : It has, it's it's getting worse with time.
[13 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Everyone's out for themselves and no one else is the problem.
[13 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : That's that's absolutely correct. Umm, I in total agreement with that. And it is very sad to see. I know that, you know, when I leave, you know, my mom or any loved one in my family, the last thing I'll be thinking about is putting my hand outgoing. OK, Now what am I gonna get? Like, you know, I'll be very sad. That exactly.
[14 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Well, I buried my dad 10 years ago, my mum five years ago, and the last thing I could have cared about was who was getting more like I That was the last thing on my mind.
[14 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Shocks me.
[14 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Didn't care one bit. And people said, oh, you're worried about what you're going to get that couldn't care.
[14 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Definitely not.
[14 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : I worried about that in six months. Whatever. I I don't care about that. Oh, I know.
[14 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : I mean, it's all materialis.
[14 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : You got to know. No, I don't.
[14 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : No, no, that's right. It's all materialistic stuff at the end of the day and what, you know, once the life is over, then the life is over.
[14 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Oh, Yep, yeah.
[14 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So that's actually like it shocks me. It's SHO.
[14 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : And then I said to him, I'd give everything back tomorrow to have one of them back, let alone both of them.
[14 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Exactly.
[14 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : You know, it's a lot of people don't look at that now.
[14 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, I know. It's shocking, isn't it?
[14 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : It's, it's all about money and values. And I, I, I still declare it's keeping up with the Jones. We've got to be better than the neighbor or better than the brother or whatever.
[15 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep.
[15 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : It's it's sad to see, but anyway.
[15 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : It is very sad to see, Sir. I completely agree. So if you do, you still have time to get the conversation at this point.
[15 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : I'm just about to go over to a Weybridge, but that's alright, I'm just idling in here. They've got a truck in front of me, so I'll just sneak in here quietly. So you alright? You can keep going for me.
[15 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, no problem. OK, so with also, umm, the application process is super simple. OK, so we don't require you to undergo, pardon me, any medical checks or blood tests. We don't ask the doctor's reports or anything. Uh, we just ask you a yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if we can get you the, the approval.
[15 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[15 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Best if you're eligible for the cover, umm, and now if you are accepted and once you commence your policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK, uh, now additionally with this policy, you do umm, we a feature of it is a terminally ill advanced payment as well, which is included in the cover. And basically what that means is if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we do actually pay your benefit amount in full to you whilst you're still alive to assist you with the medical costs there to ensure you're receiving the best. OK. So that's a nice little living feature benefit that is attached to the policy as well. OK, So if you have the time, I can commence the quote process now.
[15 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[16 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[16 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : I'm just going to go on the way bridge and pair on here. So it'll take me probably 2 minutes and then I'll be right again for a little bit. I'll just if you can bear with me for a couple of seconds here.
[16 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'm more than happy to hold. Yep.
[16 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : So I get on this way, Bridge here, I'll stop in here and see this gentleman, and I'll be back in a couple of minutes if that's all right.

[16 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Just just gonna. Why this thing? So I can get loaded back shortly.
[17 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : No problem. Yes. So all of that is done as a direct debit. There's no surcharge or anything. So if you do, let us know.

[17 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, hello. You're back with me. That's OK, I'm still here.
[17 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sorry about that.
[17 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : No, no, don't apologise.
[17 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : I just just had to talk to that bloke and get that done. Yeah, I'm not.
[17 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : That's totally fine. Totally fine.
[18 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no.
[18 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, alright.
[18 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[18 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So I'm just loading up my quotes screen here and just initially, I do need to ask you, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[18 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Nope. Never smoked in my life.
[18 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : That is very good to hear and you have strength. I can tell you. Unfortunately, I can't say the same thing to be honest. So I'm not a, I'm not proud to admit that, but umm, I can't say the same. So a kudos to you there. So I'll just remind you as well, uh, to please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes.
[18 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[18 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : I just need to remind you of that at this point of the conversation, Umm, Now, Robert, we offer three payment frequency options to our customers. So you can pay fortnightly, monthly or annually. So how would you be looking at paying the premium for the cover?
[18 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep, probably fortnightly because I get paid fortnightly so I just do it that way so I know what comes out each fortnight.
[18 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, no, that makes sense. That makes sense. So, OK. And we're looking at $200,000 worth of cover.
[19 minutes][Customer] : Yep.
[19 minutes][Agent] : Sorry, I can tell you that for $200,000 worth of cover, we're looking at a fortnightly premium of $113.07. OK. So that's just a little bit of a $55 a week. Is that sounding suitable for your budget? Is that sounding reasonable for you?
[19 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yep, standing all right at the moment.
[19 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. That's good to hear. So and that's the highest level of cover that we do offer. So that would provide you with that $200,000 worth of protection there. Umm, so that's really good to hear.
[19 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[19 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So now the next step would be to take you through the eight health questions that I did mention earlier.
[19 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[19 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, so just prior to doing that, I will need to take you through a little plea underwriting disclosure statement.

And I do need to advise you as well that your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year, OK? So as an indication, if you made no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $120.98 per fortnight.
[24 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[25 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So that's about $60.00 a week, OK. Now, in terms of the premium structure, you can find more information about that on our website, should you need to dig a little deeper into that.
[25 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[25 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, and now I'm saying all of these, umm, you've received the full approval there. So what we can do now or what the next step would be uh, if you're interested, we can have your cover commence immediately on the phone today. OK, so get you immediately covered. As of now, you're not required to make a payment, however, and this policy does give you a 30 day cooling off. So if you did decide this policy was not suitable for you and you cancel within the 30 days, then you do receive a full refund of your premium unless the claim has been made, which hopefully you would not be claiming. I've covered within 30 days.
[25 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : I hope not.
[25 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : That is something that I always think to myself because it's a little bit too soon. Umm, so basically what we would do is I would collect payment information from you so that that can be entered into the system for you and attached to your policy and then you would select the payment date that suits you the best. OK, so whatever date would suit you and then your cover would commence immediately.
[25 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, right here.
