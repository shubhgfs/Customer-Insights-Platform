[45 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I am chaseme1956@gmail.com.
[53 seconds][Agent] : Thanks for that. Umm Benito. Umm, so Benito, umm, what was the main reason you put that inquiry through? I'm just trying to, for, just for a better understanding. Did you have some cover at the moment or were you, are you new to life insurance?
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, but it's too expensive. It's, I mean, cost me 240. Yeah, $500 a month.
[1 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Umm, with your current insurance? OK.
[1 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : In that case, what we'll do, umm Benito, is we'll go through the main features and benefits and then we can go through some pricing together just so. Yeah. But before we do that, I do have to let you know, Benito, that if you are replacing existing policy, we recommend that you do not cancel that policy until the application has been approved and you have reviewed this policy. As your new policy may not be identical to your existing cover, you should also consider the benefits that may not apply or waiting periods that may start again. OK, then, Benita, So what we'll do now is we'll go through those main features and benefits just so you know what you're getting, and then we can go through the pricing together.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, so Benito, seniors life insurance is designed to write financial protection for your loved ones for a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday. When the PO. When the policy ends, you can choose cover between $10,000 up to $200,000 and you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive then on their benefit amount. So did you have anyone in mind there Benito, that you would like to leave behind that money too?
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. My wife.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Of course you can definitely do that Benito, because like like with most life insurance policy, it's not a umm, benefit for ourselves really, it's more a benefit for our loved ones that would leave behind. OK, so Benito, umm, if death was due to an accident, your chosen benefit does triple and we also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs or any other fine expenses at that time.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK Benito, it's easy to apply, we just ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you are approved.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : If you are accepted and once you commence the policy there Benito, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. In addition Benito, I hope you never have to use this benefit, but it is there for the worst. Just something for that you can fall back on. There was a terminally ill advanced payment included in your cover. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less delivered by a specialized medical practitioner, we could pay out that benefit amount in full to help with medical costs in that tough time just so you can get the best care possible. But umm, did you have any questions relating to the cover so far there?
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. No, it's all good.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Benito Beautiful. In that case, what we'll do is we'll go through the pricing together. But before we do that, let me just confirm I've got all the right details here.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[3 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : I've got your address as G01/8 Tulip Crescent, Boronia Victoria 3155, Beautiful. And you said you, you confirmed your e-mail earlier and think I've got all the right details here for you. We think we've gone over everything. So let's go through the pricing together. So to do that, I do have to ask, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months there?
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Good to hear. It's good for your health. It's good for your premiums. And keeping in mind the level of cover ranges from $10,000 up to $200,000, what level of cover did you want to start off with Benito 100,000? No worries. You can definitely look at 100,000. So for 100,000 Benito, you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $178.58. With that you also get a free online legal will that's by safe will that you can do easily at home if you haven't already got your will sorted and you get a complimentary subscription of the Australian Seniors Day magazine.

[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Is there is there much difference between the fortnight fortnight payment and the month payment?
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Well, umm, it doesn't make a difference in terms of the annual premium. So it month annually, you'll end up paying the same amount, umm, same amount.
