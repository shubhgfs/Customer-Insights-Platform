[2 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : None, thank you. So with seniors life insurance, it is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday. When the policy ends, you can choose others between 10,000 up to 200,000 and you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the nominated benefit amount. If death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple and we also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with those upfront funeral costs or, or any other final expenses you would have at the time.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : It's very easy to apply.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Let's do it.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : We just ask you 8 yes or no health questions relating, umm, sorry, related to your health over the phone to see if you are approved and if you are accepted.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : And once you commence that policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in those first thirteen months in. In addition, I hope you never have to use this, but there is a terminal illness advance payment included in this cover. So if you were ever diagnosed with, uh, with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can pay your benefit amount in full to help with those medical costs just to ensure you receive that best care possible. OK, umm, do you have any questions for me so far?
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : No, that's all.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : All right, so let's go through a quote together. So just to begin with, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[3 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Good God, no. No, never have.
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : No, fantastic. That was better for your premiums. Keeping in mind that level of cover does range from 10,000 up to 200,000, and we can look at different amounts until we find what's best for you. Did you have a figure in mind? You wanted me to start with Jonathan?
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : 400K that's fine.
[4 minutes][Agent] : The Max is 200,000, sure. So for a policy of 200,000, you are looking at a fortnightly premium of $169.69.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : 2 thou 200,000 is fine then yeah, right then that.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : How's that sounding in terms of suitability for you and your budget?
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : No, that's fine.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK.

[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, so yeah, so 200,000 and 100 and whatever it is a fortnight. That's fine.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Umm umm, I was going to mention to you as well. Have you had, uh, looked into a will at all? You and your wife, anything like that yet?
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : I'm curr. I'm currently doing that already. So I don't I I don't need that service.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : That's fine. I was just going to say because we do also provide all customers that take out a policy with a free online legal will. So you will just you will, you will receive that complimentary anyway just in case you didn't have one.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : And you'll also receive a complimentary subscription of Australian Seniors Day magazine with each policy. Would you like me to look at any other levels of cover or are you pretty happy with the 200,000?
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Oh, well, you mentioned that's the maximum.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : That is right, yes.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So I can't do any other level unless I go down. But $200,000 is fine.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yes.
