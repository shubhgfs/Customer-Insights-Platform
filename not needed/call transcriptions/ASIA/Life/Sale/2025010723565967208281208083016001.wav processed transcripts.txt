[1 seconds][Customer] : Hello, here.
[3 seconds][Agent] : Hi Peter, My name is DJ here calling from Australian Seniors Insurance. How are you doing today?
[2 seconds][Customer] : Speaking good. Thank you. You're very quick.
[9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I can see you just on our website a moment ago and inquire about some of our life insurance. So we're here to take you through that Peter, but also have to ask any questions that you may have as well. I'll just need to quickly remind you though that our calls are recorded and any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. And just confirming that I'm speaking with Peter Young, Is that correct?
[27 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Alright, yes.
[32 seconds][Agent] : And your date of birth, that is the 7th of September 1948.
[37 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[38 seconds][Agent] : And you're a male and also an Australian resident.
[42 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[42 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Now just if you're you're smoking, so to say, Peter, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? That that's awesome. Now you've seen on our website of cover, it does range from the $10,000 up to the $200,000. The quote you had requested from the website that was of the $20,000 of coverage that. Would you like me to start off the quote for you today?
[49 seconds][Customer] : No, don't see how we go on that one.
[1 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Could we use that as a startup point? And if you want to look at any other coverage up or down from there, just let me know.
[1 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : But just follow the pricing is uploaded on the system here for you. I'll give you a quick rundown how the cover does work and what's included in the cost as well. Just a quick question, if you don't mind me asking yourself, Peter, what would spark that interest? You want to take a look at this insurance for yourself today? OK, so this one, did you have something you already have covered in place at the moment? Was this? Would this be something that's new to yourself?
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I just saw an ad on the on the on the television, actually, to be honest, OK, I've had a small cover, but it was with Westpac and I changed banks and then I changed e-mail and I lost contact with it. I had it for about 10 years, but it was only for 10,000. But yeah, it's just, it's just that now, so.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : No, no, that's OK. Well, the great thing about organizing your, your life insurance cover with us here just trying to say is you can tailor this cover suture needs and around your budget and it's very easy to apply for as well. So there's no medicals, blood cyst or anything like that required from you. We only ask you 8 questions over the phone in relation to your health to see if you can be approved and if you are accepted. And once you decide to convince the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except so aside in the 1st 13 months.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it's on what?
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now in terms of how we do pel the funds, where that process works is you could nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount and this will just get paid out as a lump sum payments to them if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends and how would be your loved ones and use that money? They'll have the freudence about to use that. How would the base safe? But umm what's the benefit amount that you are insured for us you paid? That does triple for accidental deaths. If you come for the likes of the $20,000, that's going to pay out a total of $60,000 for accidental death.
[2 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Now also for that extra pace in mind at no extra cost, there is what we refer to as being a terminally ill advanced payment, which is included in the cover. We hope that you never have to use this, but it just means that if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner and we can pay out your life insurance to you in full whilst your wife's still living. And you can use these funds to help things like medical expenses, et cetera.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : And the beneficiaries of your policy, they can request for a 20% advance payment of the benefit amount just to help cover the funeral costs or the other final expenses as well. So any questions before we go through that pricing next, Peter?
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, that's what I've read already. I think you've.
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, cool. Oh, simple. Now that you've got a good idea of how the cover works, we'll go through that pricing. So if you're looking at the $20,000 of cover fortnightly, that one is $61.37, so just over $30 a week roughly. And did you want me to adjust that cover any way up or down from there? What are your initial thoughts starting off with the 20,000?
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : No, that should be alright, I suspect. Yeah, No, that that's about right. Nothing. Nothing.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : And look, it is, it is flexible in saying that, Peter. So if your circumstances through change, you can give us a call to apply the reduce your level of cover or you can apply to take out a separate top up policy from now and before you turn 80 or it'll just be subject to your eligibility at the time. But just to make sure you're fully aware of how our cover does work. So your premium is it, which means it will increase each year, but it's not an age base increase. So you don't have to worry about increasing more and more the holding again. So as an indication, if you make no changes, so the poll, your premium next year will be $65.67 a fortnight. It's about a $4.00 difference in the following year.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : It's if you do wish so, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. But the next step, let's step here though, Peter. So I'll just update all your contact details. We'll quickly go through these health questions so we can check the eligibility. It's only 8 years or no questions. So very simple to check that and then once we get you approved, that's going to allow us to send that all out to full secrets and read through all of that. It just make sure that the coverage is right for yourself. Now I've got an e-mail address from the inquiry that's info hmobilefosting.com dot AU. Is that correct?
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : I have it next month, correct?
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : And then just also post out a physical copy of that to you in the mail as well. What was your post code in QLD and Suburb?
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yes, 4077 Richlands.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Richlands and then just a street number ending. Yep, prospect, So that's 137 and then is that, oh, you know, 52?
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Richlands, OK, it's street number's 137 Prospect, it's unit #51 one at 1330.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So 51 slash 137 is that progress Rd. Which ones? Cool. And your postal address, Peter, would that be the same as your home address? Yep. Cool. And this is my phone number that would you have to say this is your best and only contact number as well.

So again, congratulations. So there's promise now that we've got you approved today, Peter, we can now go ahead and arrange to send out all your policy information to you.

So you can actually utilize this to help make that process easy and hopefully save some money in the process of doing so as well.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : But umm, good news is, you have the Peace of Mind knowing that you'll be covered over the phone with us from today for the $20,000 of the life insurance cover. And you can actually choose that payment date to start within the next 30 days to suit you. And then from that date that you slip paid attached to the policy is a 30 day calling off.

If you see an issue, if you decide to change your mind, you can simply give us a call to apply the cancelling part. There's no cancellation fees or anything like that. If you help you with the calendar you have to do from today's, that will be all done for you over the phone.
