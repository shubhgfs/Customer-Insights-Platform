Just so I can assist you further, I can just confirm your full name is Rhonda Boyen, is that correct? Sorry. So BOEYEN, is that correct?

[34 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[35 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for that. Please also just know all of our calls are recorded. Any advice? Are providers general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation? Can I also just confirm you're a female Australian resident?
[47 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[48 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for that, Rhonda. I'd just like to have a bit of understanding of what sparked your interest. Are you new to life insurance or do you currently have some cover in place?
[58 seconds][Customer] : No, we don't. We did have three guys, umm, but it sort of stopped. We were like adding a financial position to keep paying it. So what we're after is a similar thing as what that we had before.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : So basically I think it had a bit of a funeral insurance with us or something.
[1 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Oh, yeah, correct. So that sounds about right. So that that would be called something, that's something called an advance payment. I can elaborate that soon. Umm. So the purpose of my call today was, well, just to run you through all the feats and benefits, and I'll give you some pricing as well. And feel free to just stop me at any point in time if something doesn't make sense or if you have any questions now. Life insurance is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones to a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Now you can choose to cover between $10,000 and up to 200,000 and you can also you would be also nominating up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount. Now if this is due to an accident that those in benefit will triple and we do also include an advance payment of the 20% of the benefit amount to help with fuel costs in any other final expenses at that time. Now it's very easy to apply. We just ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you are approved now.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : That.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : If you are accepted and once you commence the policy, you're covered immediately for death due to any cause, accept suicide in the 1st 13 months. In addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. If you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can pay your benefit amount in full to help you with medical costs to ensure you receive the best care possible. Do you have any questions for me so far there, Rhonda?
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : No, it sounds about the same. Yeah, OK.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, no problem. So just to begin with, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? No. Good to hear, Ronda.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : No say 50.
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : And so just keeping in mind the level of cover range is from $10,000 and up to 200,000, what benefit amount would you like me to quote you on 50? OK, no problem. Bear with me while that loads. OK, so for $50,000 Rhonda, you're looking at a premium payments of $92.73 a fortnight. You do also get a free online legal bill which is worth $160.00. If you do have that in place already, you can actually give it to your immediate family, so your mother, brother, sister or kids and a compliment your subscription of the Australian's USDA magazine as well with each policy. Is that sounding affordable for you there or would you like I could look at any other levels?
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : No, that, that sounds fine. That sounds good, yeah.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, very good to hear. So keep in mind your premium is stepped, which means that will increase each year.
