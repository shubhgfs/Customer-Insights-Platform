[1 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah. Now, well, I've got a few insurers. I've got that. Yeah. I don't, I don't know, just sort of looking into it.
[1 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, fair enough. It is designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones, like through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away but your 85th birthday when the policy ends.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[2 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So there's, there's no medical checks you have to go through, but we ask you some questions over the phone relating to your health.

So hopefully you never have to go through that. But once again, peace in mind.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.

[4 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that should be alright. Yeah.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm. To be honest with you, the main thing when it comes to the life insurance is it it does come the answer the health questions we take you through because it is something we can't offer to everyone. So those questions determine if we can accept you for the cover. So it's great to hear it is sounding suitable and affordable.
