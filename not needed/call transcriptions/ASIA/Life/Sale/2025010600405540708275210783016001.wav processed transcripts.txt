[1 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[2 seconds][Agent] : Hi, good morning. OK, my name is DJ here from Australian Seniors Insurance. How are you doing today, ma'am?
[7 seconds][Customer] : I'm alright. Yeah.
[9 seconds][Agent] : Good to see. OK, I'll just follow enough from the online inquiry that was made of us on our website regarding some of our life insurance cover. We're gonna provide you with their pricing they've requested for, but also happy to answer the questions that you may have along the way as well.
[22 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[22 seconds][Agent] : And I'll just quickly remind you that our calls are recorded and any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation.
[23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that's great.
[32 seconds][Agent] : And just confirming that I'm speaking with Kay Pennant and the date of birth that is the 18th of April 1958. So was that correct?
[36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yes, yeah, that's right.
[44 seconds][Agent] : Yep, thank you. And just confirming, Kay, you're a female and also an Australian resident.
[51 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[52 seconds][Agent] : So now looking at the life insurance cover, it does range from the $10,000 up to the $200,000. And I see you've requested for the quote on the website for the $30,000.
[51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, December.
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Is that what you're likely to quote you to begin with?
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : I don't know. I've got no idea, to be honest.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : No, it's OK.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : I'm only looking at, yeah, I'm trying to think whether it's better to get life insurance insurance or funeral insurance. I'm just looking at that at the moment and I've just. MMM.
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Well, I mean, I can show you both, umm, they'll give you something to look at, umm, then compare with umm, because with the life insurance cover, umm, I mean if you're happy to, I can start off at the $30,000 and we can, you know, just that in way up.
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah, we'll just go from that. OK. I'll write that. My insurance. Yeah, sure.
[1 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we can adjust that in way up or down the suit you umm, and, and then once we've umm, discussed life insurance cover, I can show you the funeral cover just so it's not confusing trying to discuss them both at the one time.
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Because a, a life insurance cover, it's designed to provide that financial protection for your loved ones too. Or lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends. So the way it works is you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount and that would just get paid to them to be able to use however they may need to.
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. Yep.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : And when it does come to apply, it's very easy. We only ask you 8 yes or no questions in relation to health over the to see if you are approved. And yeah, if you are approved, then once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Fair enough. Yeah. Yeah.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So we do provide you with that immediate cover, OK?
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Oh, well, that's interesting.
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : But we also give you the reassurance of knowing what you'll be covered for and simply what's not covered as well. But what's the benefit amount that you're insured for under this policy? Came does triple for accidental death.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So let's say you'll come for the life of the $30,000 as as an example, that's actually going to pay out a total of $90,000 for accidental death.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Well, good. I have.
[3 minutes][Agent] : OK, but under the yeah, Well, I'll touch one.
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : I have the laptop in heaven. But you never know.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, for sure.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Did you?
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Uh, but in addition to this, there is a terminally ill advanced payment as well. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medic practitioner, then we can pay out your life insurance to you in full walks.
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No. That sounds good.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : You are still living and you can use these funds to help with things like your medical expenses, etcetera, OK.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK, I've got the one. Hell.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Now with this policy as well, OK, there is actually a funeral component that's built into the cover at no extra cost. So your beneficiaries, they can request for a 20% advance payment of the benefit amount to help cover those upfront costs. So hopefully there's no burden left for them to have to cover on them. But umm, any questions so far?
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Oh, well, no, yeah, yeah, it's fine. No, that's good.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, now just with your smoking status, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes][Customer] : Oh, yes, yeah.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's fine. Now looking at the coverage for the $30,000 to start off with on a fortnightly basis, that one is $48.56. So around 24, just over 24 a week roughly.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Now did you want me to adjust that cover any way up or down, OK. Or would you feel that would be a suitable cover? Yeah, sure.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Maybe we'll go down 20,000 and see what, whether that's a bit cheaper, I don't know.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : If you that, that would bring down the fortnightly premium to $32.38 a fortnight. Yes. So $32.38 every two weeks that covers you for the $20,000.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : That sounds better, $32.38 did you take OK 16? Perfect.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Uh, looks out to be just over $16.00 a week roughly for that one because with the comma caters flexible. So let's say you start off with the $20,000 as an example and then later down the track you decided that you needed some extra cover with us. Any time from now on before you turn 80, you can apply it to a separate top up policy.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : It will just be subject to your eligibility at the time.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Or you can apply to reduce your level of cover as well.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : But your premium is it, which means it will increase each year.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Yeah, mm.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : But as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will go from $32.38 a fortnight to $34.65 a fortnight. OK.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : But if you do wish, you can also find information about premium structure on our website as well.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : But looking at the $20,000 of coverage, do you want me to bring that down and show you what the $10,000 look like?
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : I think, yeah, yeah. That's better.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because if we're looking at, say, the $10,000 of cover, umm, that would bring down the fortnightly premium to $16.19. That be a more suitable cover.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that sounds better.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, cool. Umm, So what we'll do next here is I'll just update all your contact details.
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : We'll go through those eight half questions so we can check the eligibility and then get you approved over the phone.
