[1 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Now, Gavin, you can choose a cover between $10,000 up to $200,000 and you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the nominated benefit amount.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Now, if your death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit amount will triple. We also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount on top of that with UMM, just to assist with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it is easy to apply. What we do is we just ask you 8 yes or no questions relating to your health over the phone to see if you are approved. If you are accepted and once you commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except for suicide in the 1st 13 months. Now Gavin, we also offer umm, a benefit called a terminally ill advanced payment. Now that's included in the cover.

[2 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by specialized medical practitioner, what we do is we actually pay out your benefit amount in full to you while she's still alive.
