[2 seconds][Agent] : Hello. Good afternoon. Thank you for calling Australian Seniors Insurance. This is Maggie. How may I help you?
[10 seconds][Customer] : And good morning. It's Ian. Yeah, I'm just ringing to see if I can get life insurance.
[8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. Let me have a look for you. Thank you for calling in. OK. All calls are recorded. Any advice I'm providing is generally nature and may not be suitable to your situation. My name is Maggie. Let's have a look together for you. I can help you. Yep. I've found you. Ian. What was your surname? Thank you. Yeah. And your date of birth, please.
[32 seconds][Customer] : Hodges, the 14th, the 12th, 1953.
[39 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Let's have a look. I know I said all calls are recorded. Any advice on providing is genuinely nature and may not be suitable to your situation. I can see that you've got a cover with us already. A funeral cover. Is that right?
[51 seconds][Customer] : That's correct, yes.
[52 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK. Well, because you've got that in place, you can certainly look at the life insurance. But when you've got another cover in place, I'll just confirm if you are replacing and you can have another one sitting alongside it anyway, but just need to clarify. If you are replacing an existing policy, we recommend that you do not cancel that policy until your application has been approved and you have reviewed this policy as your new policy may not be identical to existing cover and you should also consider the benefits that may not apply. Or waiting please. It may start again. OK.
[1 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[1 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So this can certainly sit alongside it. They can I confirm one more thing. Are you a male Australian resident as well? Thank you. So tell me about you, Ian, what's made you decide to have a look at the life insurance because we've developed something for our seniors, umm, in that you can have it at this stage in life just to leave a little something for your family behind for them. But what made you decide to have a look, please? Yeah.
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I did have another one, but I think it's for another couple of years and I won't get anything out.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I don't. So you don't. You still have it now or not? You don't have it. OK. All right. Yeah. And tell me about you. Do you have children or loved ones yourself?
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : No, yes.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK. Just be sorry. I'm trying not to sneeze in your ear. I do apologize. Sorry about that. All right. So are you looking at something just to leave behind for your loved ones to tidy everything up for you when that time comes? Yeah.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Umm yeah, so do I, because I probably can't bored too much in it.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, well, yeah. Alright, well, let's look for you. So the cover is designed to do that. What it is, it's a lump sum benefit is paid out if you were to unfortunately pass away, uh, before you ace his birthday when the policy ends. And you can choose anywhere from 10,000 all the way up to $200,000 depending on what your needs are, of course. But keep in mind, if your death was due to an accident, the benefit amount your family receives will be tripled. OK so if you had like a $20,000 policy for instance and you death with you to an accident, your family and loved ones will receive $60,000 OK? Yep, now it's very easy to apply. We only ask you 8 questions in relation to your health. So you can have a number of different medical conditions and still be eligible for this cover OK Because it's design we're seeing is in mind. So once I've looked at 8 questions to see if we can get you approved, if you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for debt you to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK, Yes.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. Yep.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Now there's a living benefit on here. This one's for you, Ian. It's called a terminally ill advanced payment. This is on your coverage. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, what we're gonna do in that case is pay the claim in full to you. And that can assist you with your medical costs, allowing you to get the very best care possible. OK, All right. Now, can I ask you, do you have any questions for me at all so far before we have a look?
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK, moment.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : All right, let's look. OK, one second, can I ask you, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Sorry. No, don't smoke.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : All right, so we're saying no to that. Is that alright?
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : No, that's correct.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Umm, now also in this series of advanced payment, if your family wants it, they can request a 20% of your benefit amount to come out first if they need to help with funeral and final expenses as well. OK, just a little bit extra there for them if they need it uh comes out first.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : OK, so now I can look at anywhere from the 10,000 up to 200,000. Depends on what your needs are at this stage and your affordability as well of course. What amount would you like to look at first? Thank you.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : What about if I say 15? Oh, OK.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : I can do 10 or 20,000 and then so it goes in $10,000 increments. Yeah. Do you want to look at the 20,000?
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. How much that would cost?
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, $20,000 would come in at $43.75 per fortnight. Does that one sound like that would work for you or do you want to look at the 10,000 or?
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : 10,000 miles shot at the 10,000.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. 10,000 would be $21.88 a fortnight. Is that working for you?
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, we'll try that, see how they go.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : All right, well, let's, yeah, let's have a look at your eight questions and we'll see if you're eligible. OK, let me look here. Let me update all your details to make sure they're correct. Thanks, Ian. Umm, oh, you're the second person I've spoken to in West Australia this morning. All right, so is it ianhodges53@gmail.com.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : OK, Correct.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Mobile is 0418745140.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Do you have a landline as well or not?
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So what was that again?
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Any landline or just the mobile?
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Just a mobile?
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Not many people have a landline anymore.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Umm, are you still at Ellenbrook in West Australia 6069? Yep. Hang on a SEC. And you're still at UH, 4 Bronzewing Ave.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep, that's right.
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Alright, if your home address and your postal address both the same, thank you.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's look for you. Thank you. Alrighty, let's go in and we'll have a look and see if you're eligible. Umm, OK 2 just going into it. Sorry, I'm just waiting for my computer to catch up to me. So let me explain as well. Your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year. But this is something else we've done we've seen as your mind as well in that your benefit amount is gonna remain the same on 10,000. It won't reduce and it won't increase either. OK, so you don't have a CPI on it. Alright, so let me show you. So as an indication for you, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $23.41 a fortnight. Your benefit amount will stay on the 10,000 and 30,000 for your accidental death. OK. And you, yeah. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. So it'll go from $21.88 a fortnight to $23.41 a fortnight. So it's just, I think it's just under $2.00 or just around $2.00 difference for you. OK, Approximately.
[7 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Would not be 23. What was it, 23? Yep.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Alright, yeah, it'll go from 21 and $0.88 a fortnight to $23.41 a fortnight.
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, alright, now let's have a look. I'm gonna read out two quick paragraphs. This explains why we asked the question. Just stay with me for a second and then we'll look together. OK, one SEC. OK, so this one says. Please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes. We collect your postal information to provide insurance quotes, issue cover and other related services. We will share this with your insurer and make sure it with other Australian service providers for the purpose of administering your policy or handling claims. A privacy policy tells you more, including how to access and correct your information and lodge complaints about breaches of privacy.

You need to answer each question in full, even if you have provided some information to us in any earlier discussions you have had. If you do not take reasonable care, you may breach your duty and if this happens, your insurer may be entitled to cancel your policy, decline the claim or make adjustments to the terms and conditions of your policy. Do you understand and agree to your duty, yes or no? Thank you. Let's have a look for you. So with the questions, just give me a yes or no at the end of each one and we'll see how we go, right? If you're not sure, stop me and we'll certainly talk about it. OK, Thanks, Ian. So it's actually 9 questions. First one's about COVID.
