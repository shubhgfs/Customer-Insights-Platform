[2 seconds][Customer] : Hello, Cynthia.
[4 seconds][Agent] : Hi Cynthia, my name is Ashley. I'm calling from Australian Seniors. How are you?
[3 seconds][Customer] : Speaking Good. How are you?
[9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, doing really well. I'm just giving you a call as we have received some expression of interest online with regards to our life insurance.
[17 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's right.
[19 seconds][Agent] : Just like to assist you further, may I please confirm your full name and your date of birth?
[23 seconds][Customer] : It's Cynthia Farn and it's 12871.
[27 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And lastly, I'll just confirm you are a female Australian resident. Thank you. Please note all of our calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. So Cynthia, what had you looking into life insurance? Are you completely new to it? Have you had covered before? MM Hmm, yes.
[31 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I've got existing cover with real life insurance, so I was.
[54 seconds][Agent] : Do you have a family as well?
[56 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes I do.
[59 seconds][Agent] : OK, so if you do currently have a policy already in place, we do recommend to you not replace an existing policy. Umm, so let me start again. If you are replacing an existing policy, we recommend that you do not cancel that policy until your application has been approved and you received this policy as your new policy may not be identical to your existing cover.
[1 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Mm hmm.
[1 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : And lastly, you should also consider the benefits that may not apply or any waiting periods that may start again with seniors life insurance. It is designed to provide that financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away before your 85th birthday when the policy ends.
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : You can choose cover between 10,000 up to 200,000 and actually nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount. If death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple and we also include an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount to help with those upfront funeral costs or any other final expenses you do have at the time. It's very easy to apply. We only ask you 8 yes or no health questions over the phone to see if you are approved.
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : If you are accepted and once you commence that policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause except suicide in those first thirteen months. In addition, I hope you never have to use this, but there is also coverage as a terminal ill advanced payment included in this cover. So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a specialized medical practitioner, we can also pay that benefit amount in full to help with those medical costs.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : No, not at the moment.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Did you have any questions for me so far or pretty straightforward? OK, wonderful. So let's go through some pricing together. Umm, to begin with, I do have to ask, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah, no. I.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, so we have a couple of options in regards to payments. So you can do fortnightly, monthly or annually. Which works better for you?
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Probably monthly.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. OK. So keeping in mind that level of cover, again, this range from 10,000 up to 200,000 and we could of course look at different amounts until we find the right level of cover for you. Do you have a amount in mind you wanted me to start with?
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : I'll go the maximum.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, sure. So if we're looking at the maximum policy of 200,000, you're looking at a monthly premium of $194.10. That equates to about $6.40 per day.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : How's that sound in your terms of suitability, price wise, budget? Mm hmm.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Good, good.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Umm, have you, do you have a will in place already?
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK. Because with uh, Australian seniors, we do also offer umm, a free online legal will Umm, so that's complementary with any policy we do provide.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Mm, Hmm.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : And you will also receive complementary subscription of our Australian Seniors Day magazine with each policy you do take out with. And with life insurance, you do have to be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year. So as an indica, if you made no changes to your policy, your premium next year would be roughly $207.69. And if you did need more information about the premium structure, you can find that on our website as well.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So the next steps that we can do is if you're happy to, to take you through the health questions just to ensure you would be eligible for this cover. Are you happy to do that now? OK. Before I do so, may I please have your home address starting with the post code and suburb Minato, not Minato South?
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep, it's 5254 Minato, 9 Minato.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, Thank you. And just the address there, please.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : It's 83 Premima PREA MI double MA Rd.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful. I have that here. Thank you for that. You're happy for me to have that as your postal address, OK.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes, actually. Excuse me, could you put the postal address as 5042 at Pasadena?
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So I'll get you to, I just have to bring up the postal address section again. Could you just repeat that first part for yes. Mm hmm, OK, PO Box, sorry. Could you repeat that one more time?
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yep, 5042 Pasadena and it's PO Box 1025 10/25.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : 10/25 Thank you for that. What was the post code there? I'm so sorry. May I please have the PO Box 1 more time? Sorry.
[6 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : 5042, yeah, it's 10/10/25.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. OK, perfect. So that's been updated. OK. All right, let me just get back into this application. So what I have to do now, I do have to read you what we call a pre underwriting disclosure agreement. It just takes a couple of minutes to do so.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
