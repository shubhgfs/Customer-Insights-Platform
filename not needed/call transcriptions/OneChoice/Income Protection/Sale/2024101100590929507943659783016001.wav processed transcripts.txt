[1 minutes][Customer] : OK, cool. Thanks.
[56 seconds][Agent] : We do not consider your personal circumstances, but as well just in terms of income protection and so I can have that better understanding. Do you currently have some cover in place?

[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : But with the cover, what it does is it it's designed to provide a monthly income benefit paid directly to you if you are unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. It is designed to help cover the bills and living costs if your salary is interrupted for the company. You can apply if you work at least 15 hours per week in paid employment for an income benefit. We offer up to 75% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 all the way up to a maximum of $15,000. The process is nice and simple, everything's done all over the phone. There's no forms here to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete. We just go through some health and lifestyle questions and they determine the final pricing and return to the policy. And once that is in place, it will cover you into your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the policy document, just with. Premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible depending on the policy structure, which could make it even more cost effective for you, but you would have to speak to the your tax professional to find that out. What we'll do is we're going to go through a duty based question in regards to your current work employment. If you don't mind me asking, what do you currently do for work?
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : I'm area manager for a cleaning company.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Oh beautiful, lovely. Well, just the first one I just ask in terms of cigarette and smoking status, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months, yes or no?

[3 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all of our questions accurately and honestly.

Are you required to perform any physical duties?

And I'm so so just with that smoking status question, I've just got to grab with that yes or no. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? No, that's OK. With your employment status, are you currently employed or self-employed?
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, employed.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : No problem, I'm going to give you a definition of pre tax income. Pre tax income is the total annual remarration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses.

[5 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, 55, OK, yeah.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem at all. So putting down 55,000 and based on your duties and income, you can select a monthly benefit amount, a benefit amount from the $1000 up to $3437. But what amount would you like me to quote you on the 3400?
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : 3400 first, yeah.
[6 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I can look at that one for you. And then as well, in terms of the types of different waiting periods and benefit periods, depending on your circumstances, you have the option to select different waiting periods. The waiting period is a non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Which waiting period would you like me to select?
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : So you guys?
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : 30 days, No problem. And as well, the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. You can choose from six months, one year, two years or five years. But which benefit. Would you like me to select?
[7 minutes][Customer] : I don't understand that 10. That's right.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Oh.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So what has if it ends up being as that the supposedly ends up being less than than the agreed time frame, is it all bad or is that change things or what happens if the recovery time off ends up being greater than the policy that you selected?
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Also, so like you're going to be if you select a six month period, you're going to be covered for that injury for that six month period.
[7 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : If it was to end earlier, like in terms of the policy, we can understand like injuries can heal a lot quicker. But once that once that. Has ended and if it was quicker than that six months if you chose six months and then the policy would just still continue and if that illness or injury happened again, it would happen like you would just reapply, reapply for that that process if it was a different illness or injury. But that benefit. It's specifically to the time of.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, six months.
[7 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : That you would like the income benefit for one any injury or illness, but you have the option six months. OK.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 'cause generally it takes about that long to get back on your feet after accident or illness.
[8 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : I can put six months for OK, well, I can put down six months there for you with the next step. It's essentially to go through the health and lifestyle questions. That's the final premium in terms of the policy is dependent on the outcome.
