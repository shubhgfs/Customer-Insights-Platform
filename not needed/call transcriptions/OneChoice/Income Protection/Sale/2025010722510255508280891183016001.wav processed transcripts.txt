[12 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So just confirming it was just option A OK perfect. Now umm, there's the dot dot down question underneath that asks how many episodes have you had which required treatment. Umm it can. It can sound a bit tricky there. So I read out the definition. What's classified as like a single second and separate episode? Umm. How to define though is an episode is an event, occurrence, or recurrence of symptoms with increased severity from normal mood and usually require either medical intervention, referral treatments, or a change to existing maintenance treatments, whether they're treatment to this medication or even counseling or therapy. What's defined as a single episode is if you have symptoms of a condition that require treatment that would be classified as one episode, and if you return to your doctor several times to either monitor the situation or for repeat prescriptions, that still counts as the same single episode. Umm, If, however, you have a relapse or symptoms worsen and treatment needs to be changed or increased, this would then be, uh, considered a second episode. And then similarly, if you were to recover and then treatment stops and you're fine, umm, but at a later date, symptoms returning, you have to go back to your doctor for further advice. This would be a separate episode. I'm so the options we have there that we can disclose this Sunday is one to two episodes 3 to 4-5 to six or seven plus.

[14 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[14 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, no worries.
[14 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Well, I think single is. Yeah. Is it single spot?
[14 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[14 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[14 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So we we can we can disclose that under just one episode there for you now have you had symptoms or treatment for this condition within the last six months And have you ever seriously contemplated or attempted suicide and have the factors or causes that triggered the symptoms been partially or fully removed? OK wonderful. And in the last 10 years have you required hospitalization as a result of this condition? OK.

So the approved amount there for you for the monthly benefit amount of $7812.00, waiting period of 30 days and benefit period of five years, you'd be looking at a fortnightly premium of $248.86 per fortnight. But Lisa, how did that sound?
[26 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, it seems to have been what I thought. Is that OK?
[26 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, it can be, it can be customized differently in the sense that, umm, if, if a monthly benefit amount less than that can work for you still to look after the mortgage or even the benefit. Can be reduced as well. Did you have like a budgeted figure that you had in mind to pay for the income protection? OK.
[27 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : No, I I don't Yeah, No, to be honest, I I actually have no idea how much this sort of stuff cost, but yeah. But you know, I'm not, I'm not saying it's not doable. It's just, you know, so was it 248 is at least 240.
[27 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So $248.86 per fortnight if you kept everything that at that same way of the maximum monthly benefit amounts and next month benefit.
[27 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : What about if you it's, you know how I had the 30 day waiting period? What about does it go down if you go to whatever the next one is?
[27 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the 90 day. Actually reduces that down.
[27 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Is it 90 days or something? OK.
[27 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So so to bring that down there for you, I'll let you know what the adjusted one would be. OK Yeah. And that's that's fair. It's good to you that you're well prepared. I guess sometimes, you know, you may need the savings for anything else, but you know anything une unexpected can happen.
[27 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that'd be good because I have got savings I can dip into if something happens, so maybe, yeah.
[28 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : The if we bring that to 90 days there for you. That way you can still have the same monthly benefit amounts as well as the same benefit period of five years. That brings that down to an approved price of $150.62 per 4th. I didn't stand now over this. Your premium is stamped, which means it will generally increase as you age.
[28 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Oh, alright, Yeah, yeah.
[28 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : In addition, this policy comes with what's called automatic indexation. OK, So what this means is that each year your sum insured that you have will increase by 3% until you reach the maximum benefit of $15,000 per month with associated increases in premium. Umm, that, uh, indexation there isn't, uh, uh, what's it like a mandatory thing? So if you'd like to opt out of that, what we do is send you the renewal notice of your policy and you can opt out of this indexation each you to keep that at the same amount there for yourself as well moving forward.
[29 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, OK. Oh no, that sounds good. Alright. No, that's that's cool. Do you see something? I've got a couple of other places I'm waiting to get it.
[29 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Now, yeah.
[29 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Would you be able to e-mail me a like that quote and then Cos I, I want to get it sorted in the next two weeks and then I can come back to you guys. But yeah, I've just got a couple more places that I'm waiting to hear that from.
[29 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. No, that's OK.
[29 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : So is that alright?
[29 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Are you as in like you're just shopping around as well?
[29 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. Well, since that's the case, I can do this two different ways there for you.
[29 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Cool.
[29 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Based on what such a situation, I can send you through general information and pricing to start out with before going ahead with the policy.
[29 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Perfect. Yep.
[29 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Since the key thing you mentioned is you're also doing some shopping around. Another option is we can get you covered with the policy from today. The key thing is that you don't have to start the payments from today, so you can choose a later payment date that you'd prefer whilst shopping around for some other options in case you do find something else that suits you better. Though there's no lock in contracts or cancellation fees so you would just need to give us a call and let us know if you went with a different option as well.
[30 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Oh, oh, OK.
[30 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Does that option sound better for you?
[30 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that sounds OK. That sounds good. Yeah yeah.
[30 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because whilst whilst this is what we will still e-mail you to all the documentation and I'll send out a hard copy for you. The policy does give you a 30 day cooling off.
[30 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Oh, super yeah, yeah. Cool.
[30 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So if you do change your mind about the policy after the payments already started and cancel within 30 days of that first payment, you will receive a full refund of your premiums unless a claim has been made now.
[30 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Well, that sounds. Sorry, I've got to ask earlier. So this in capitation. What about does it cover like I get if you've got sickle something or had an accident, What about does it cover like if you get fire or like made redundant or something like that? Is there any provision to cover for that or is it just purely for sickness and accident? Right.
[31 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yes, so the monthly income benefit is mainly payable for if you suffer disabling sickness or injuries.
[31 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[31 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : It can't be paid in the event of redundancy, however if you do, if you are made a voluntary redundant, we do have a redundancy premium waiver benefit. Umm. What that means is that we will waive your policies regular premium for a maximum of three consecutive months.
[31 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[31 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : During this.
[31 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's good. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. Cool.
[31 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Your policy will remain in force, which means even in the event that you aren't a are able to work due to a disabling sickness or injury, you'll still be able to make a claim back from the policy during that time as well.
[31 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK. No, that's that's alright. I mean, it's easy enough to get another job for insurance, so yeah, that's fine. OK. No, that's cool.
[31 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK, I'll just confirm your details I have here.
[31 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[31 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Umm, listen one thing though, I do not want to put you your surname. Can you just let me know how to pronounce it again?

[32 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Did you recently moved by any chance or OK? Yeah no that's OK, that's alright. That's happened to me before as well. Umm, my address has two different actual numbers associated because it was a lot 1st and now it's a normal address so sometimes I get it mixed up as well.
[32 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : I took a passport with my sister, so yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I yeah, 13 13 Hooper EV. That's right. I'm just looking at my date. Yeah, 13 Hooper.

What day would you be happy for the first payment to be for the policy?
[33 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, let's have a look now. How do you, how do you do it fortnightly, monthly?
[33 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So the, the three options, they have a four nightly, monthly and yearly. So it's just based on which one suits you best. It's the same amount you pay per year for the policy. It's just either, uh, once annually, 12, uh, divided by 12 if it's monthly or 26 full nightly.
[33 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : What's what's the goodwill in? I looked, was it $150.62? That was the fortnight, wasn't it?
[33 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Uh, yes, that's correct, $150.62 a four.
[34 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Might be better than just doing monthly because I get paid monthly.
[34 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[34 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : So we can start. Yeah.
[34 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Let me just adjust that for you, OK.
