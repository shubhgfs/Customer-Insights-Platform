If you're unable to work you to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. As you know, it's designed to help you cover your bills and your living cost of your salary was to be interrupted.

[1 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Just reached if you have a covering.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yep, not to worry at all. Reason I'll start with the insurance. With the monthly benefit that's provided, you'll be in complete control on how that money is used. We have no say so if it's renting, medical expenses, bills. Again, the money can be used in any way you do see best fit with and then we can offer you an income benefit of up to 75% of your monthly pre tax income. It's from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. And so As for replying, we keep it nice and simple as well. It's all over the phone so there's no forms that you have to fill in or medical checks. We simply just go through yes or no questions, which is what will determine the final price in the exact terms of the policy. And then once the policy is set in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday, OK? Just keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the policy document. But what I'll do, I'll go through some questions with you, Brad. Let's generate some pricing and then we can work out the best cover for you to be entitled to UMM. But just before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly.

However excluding employer, Kiwi saver and super contributions. So based on that, can I ask for your annual income? Ah, before taxes?

Now understand you mentioned you wanting to cover your rents, your bills in terms for our monthly amount. What do you feel like would be best to be covered for under your income reception?
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : How to say probably like 2500 maybe. I know.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, I know it's not easy. I understand it's a bit tricky question to answer. We can always sign here if you like the 2500 and then we cannot work up or down in regards to your budget and what you feel like would be best. How does that sound?
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : All right. Oh great. Just before we do so, there's a couple of other things I need to ask you about the waiting period firstly. So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable. After the insured event, you have the options to select 30 days or 90 days. Which waiting period would you like me to select for you? OK. And then you've got the benefit. The benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone in real injury or illness. You have the options to select six months, one year, two years or five years. Which benefit. Would you like me to select?
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : 30 days would be good, probably one year.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a worry. All right, So what the next steps is for you, Brad? So we need to go through a series of health and lifestyle questions with you.
