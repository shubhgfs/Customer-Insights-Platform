[29 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : No, Yep, I got one question there.
[30 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure.
[30 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : You know that you asked me the question about the how long I want the policy for. Am I right? Is it how long my policy is if I if I get it?
[30 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Do you mean your waiting period or your benefit. Or do you mean how long is it, you know, is it valid for? How long is the valid for?
[30 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[30 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[30 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : That's what I want to know.
[30 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, yeah, yeah. So this cover, it'll cover you until your POLI policy anniversary following your 65th birthday, OK?
[30 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[30 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So right up to that time for you. Yeah, absolutely. Now let's do a little recap though, to make sure you're happy with all of this.
[30 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[31 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So what we have is we have your monthly benefit amount of $3437 in the month. You've got a waiting period of 30 days, which you choose, and you've got a benefit period of six months. That's a four nightly premium of $153.18 per fortnight.
[31 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Can you change that?
[31 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yes, of course. Obviously you can have one year, two years or five years.
[31 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Six months, One for how I need five years.
[31 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's do that for you. Let's see the change for you. Now your premium is set, which means it will generally increase each years your age. Now I'm going to explain a little bit of information for you as well.
[31 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[31 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So now if I change that fortnightly, if I change that to five years, it increases your premium, OK? That means your premium fortnightly will now be 350, $6.90 per 4/9, correct. So the higher you go in the benefit. Because that's more time we'll be paying you do. Does that make sense?
[31 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Fortnite, yeah.
[32 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So what the Ben, what the benefit. Is, it's the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness.
[32 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK. So the West, which one? The best one. I want to know.
[32 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So if you have five years, that's the maximum that means your premium is going to be higher, that you pay well, OK, So the lower you are in the benefit periods, the lower your premium will be. So you can have. Yeah, Alright, let's have a look at two years and see what that gives us. Yes, that's OK. That's alright. So if we move the benefit period to two years, it'll be a fortnightly premium now of $241.05.
[32 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : I think make it for two years, there's something come up, we can put it again, you know, just want to see all weeks, OK. Yeah.
[32 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, now the waiting, you can change if you want to, you've got it at 30 days, but if you wanted to change it to 90 you can. It's up to you.
[33 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : No, leave it for 30.
[33 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, leave 30 and am I leaving the benefit. For two years as well?
[33 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[33 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, now I want to tell you some information. Included in your policy is what's called a rehabilitation benefit. So this can help you to return to work. So the rehabilitation benefit which pays an additional reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit to a maximum of $3000 to help with rehabilitation costs whilst claiming pay while they're claiming or we can reimburse up to six times your income benefit towards cost of equipment or modifications required to assist you to return to work. OK, Now in addition. OK, so in addition, and I know you said originally that you wanted more for your monthly benefit, but however in addition, this policy has automatic indexation.
[33 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep, Yep.
[33 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : And what that means is each year your sum insured, it will increase by 3% until you reach the Max and benefit of $15,000 per month, OK with associated increases in premium. But you see Shandra, you can opt out of this in automatic indexation if you if you each year if you want to. So if you do want that amount to grow, you can each year. But when you reach the amount that you want or if you don't want it to grow, you just opt out of each year.
[34 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Sir, if I get in 2500, every fortnight, how much will be come up?
[34 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's have a look. So 2500, let's go down to that one.
[34 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : This is my way.
[34 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, That's OK. No, it's good. No, this is good.
[34 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : This I am talking about, yeah.
[34 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So when you think about this, it's really just what you need, you know, to survive. Sometimes we have in our mind what we'd like, but when you think about it, it's what you actually need to get by, you know? So if you looked. Yeah, go ahead. Sorry.
[34 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yes, because yeah, No, because we are paying the mortgage. This I'm thinking about.
[35 minutes][Agent] : I understand. Yeah. Yeah, I, I understand.
[34 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Is something wrong or you know, so you know, yeah.
[35 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I totally understand. So let's have a look at this one for you. So if we change your monthly benefit PE amounts to 2500, we'll do that. We'll keep the waiting period at the 30 days for you. We have changed the benefit period to two years. You'd be looking at every two weeks you'll pay. Let's have a look. It would be $175.34 every two weeks.
[35 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[35 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : That better?
[35 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[35 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I'll get this set up for you now right away. I'll send your policy documents for you to review. You'll have a 30 day cooling off.
