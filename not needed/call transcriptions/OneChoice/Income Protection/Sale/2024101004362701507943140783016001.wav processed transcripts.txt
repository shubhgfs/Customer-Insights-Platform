[52 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[48 seconds][Agent] : Any advice I provide is limited to the products we offer for you to make a decision about whether they are suitable for your needs. We do not consider your personal circumstances. First of all, thank you so much for inquiring today. Can I ask, is income protection something you've looked into before or is this your first time?
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. This is for first time. Yeah.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : No worries that? And was there anything that sparked your interest or made you start thinking about income protection for yourself?
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Not at the moment, yeah.
[1 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : No, OK. Because as you know, being an income protection policy, it provides a monthly benefit directly to you. If you're unable to work you with disabling sickness or injury, you suffer a loss of income. It's designed to be able to help you cover your bills and your living costs if your salary was to be interrupted. If you don't mind me asking, what kind of expense are you use are you wanting to have covered? Is it more general expenses of living or bills?
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that was like that was like I'm, I didn't have the moment, but I just painted my end to the house.
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Just your wrench?
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yep, understand.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : And just to previous like that, the income protection insurance can cover for the identity or something like that, because you know, like in this market everyone is just, you know.
[1 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Umm yes good question. We don't have a such like a redundancy cover. Umm, yeah, we don't have a redundancy cover, but we do have circumstances in places if you want to be made redundant, which I'll explain as well. Give me one second and I'll bring it up. It's a premium waiver is what it is. So we can cover your, your umm, your premium for a certain amount of time.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : I'm just going to get up now and then I can let you know how that works too. Just what we're bringing up. Do you currently have any insurance in place at the moment or would this be a brand new policy for you?
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no insurance only just for the my car insurance. That's it.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, right, OK, completely fair enough. Because I understand as you were mentioning, you've got renting expenses. I'm sure you've got generally expensive living of bills and life expenses that that come with that.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, everything, all and stuff, Yeah.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And this is what this insurance is designed for. If you're unable to work you to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income, we provide a monthly benefit to you. And that could be there to help with the renting expenses, could be there to help with general expenses of living, even for medical expenses that it's whatever you may need. That's what this insurance is designed for. So I assume this is your first time looking into an insurance like this as well? Yeah, not a worry at all.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, this is pasta. Yeah.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : I'll, yeah, I'll, I'll give you a bit more of a better rundown and have a good understanding on what this insurance is designed for. I'm still just looking up that that first question you asked in regards for the redundancy and I'm about to get to it. Give me one second. Thanks for your patience. OK, so for redundancy we've got a redundancy premium waiver benefit.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So if you are made involuntary redundant we will cover your premiums for three consecutive months whilst your policy remains active. So you would continue to be covered. We would cover the premiums for you again if you were to be made involuntary redundant then Does that make sense?
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Uh, what is the voluntary?
[4 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Involuntary.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Correct. Correct, correct, correct.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So to be in no control of your own if you were made involuntary redundant.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Correct. Yeah, I understand.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yes. So that that's that part.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, yeah, go for it.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Mm Hmm, not to worry at all. So I'll let you know a few other benefits with the cover as well. So we can offer you an income benefit of up to 75% of your monthly pre tax income.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : It's from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000 per month in terms for applying. We keep it nice and simple as well. Everything's over the phone. There's no forms that you have to fill out or medical checks. We just go through a series of yes or no questions with you, which I'll personally help you go through. And that's what confirms your eligibility and the exact terms of the policy as well.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : And then once in place, it, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Just keep in mind that there are some exclusions that are that apply as outlined in the policy document there. OK, So I'll generate some pricing for you now. Then we can work out the best to cover for you to be entitled to. I just have some questions to ask. Uh, just before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of our duty, sorry of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your coverage claims time.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, so with the clean, so no. Do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[5 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : No, I just had a contact there with the 1037.5 hours a week.

[6 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Not at all. Not at all.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : I'm not sure if you're quite understanding the question. So it's asking you if do you work a minimum of 15 hours or more per week. You mentioned you're 37.5 hours per week. Is that right?
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Correct.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, So you, you do work more than 15 hours, 15 hours or more per week.

[8 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Are you currently employed or self-employed?
[8 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : I'm currently a full time employee with the.
[8 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK thank you for letting me know that. So I do need to ask what your annual income is before tax. But just to provide you a definition of pre tax income. The pre tax income is the total annual remuneration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular conditions or bonuses. However excluding employer, Kiwi saver and super contributions. So based on this, can I ask what is your annual income before tax? Thank you so much. OK. And then so just to double check, that was $86,000? That's correct.
[8 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Uh, before test last year was $86,000 Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yearly, yeah.
[8 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK yearly before tax. Perfect. And then what that means for your regards to the monthly benefit amount, we can offer you cover from a minimum of $1000 to a maximum of $5374. There's $100 increments in between. For example, minimum is 1000 external 1101 thousand 200 all the way up to $5374.00 per month. What monthly benefit do you feel like would be best to be covered for?
[9 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : What is the benefit like? What was the benefit to call like? Still can understand. Yeah, that part.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. So what we're discussing here now normal is the amount that you will receive on a monthly basis from your income protection. If you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or or injury and you suffer a loss of income, again, it will be the amount that we pay to you in that event then, so you get to choose the amount you'd like to receive. It ranges from a minimum of $1000 to a maximum of $5374. There's $100 increments as well in between.
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : And so, so this is top of the my salary, right?
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, can you say that again?
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, this is top of my salary, right.
[10 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : 75% of your monthly pre tax income is $5374.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. Yeah, go for it. Yeah, Yeah, go for it. That's fine. So then after that I need to be cut down the tax, right.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So that's the maximum we can cover the I'm so sorry, can you say that again please?
[10 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : So after that I need to be paid for the tax, right?
[10 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : You have to pay the tax.
[10 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, in a 5400 and something. So it's a before tax is just after tax.
[10 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Well, well, this is the amount that we pay to you.
[10 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, got it. Yeah, go for it. Yeah.
[10 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, this is the amount that we pay for you. OK, So when do you say go for it 'cause I know you were explaining to me that you've got rent expenses, you get general expenses of living that you're wanting to cover. Did you want to go with the top cover? Is that what you're saying? Go for it or what? What amount do you want to receive on a monthly basis?
[11 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : It's a top goal.
[11 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Top cover? OK, so $5374 and then you've got the waiting period and benefit period to select from. So the waiting period is the non payment MI sorry. The one period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You have two options, 30 days or 90 days. Which waiting period would you like me to select for you?
[11 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : So what is the waiting period?
[11 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So the waiting period is how long you actually have to wait before you get your first payment after the insured event.
[11 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Seems like so do it's. So what is the difference is 30 days and 90 days?
[11 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So what the 30 days means you have to wait 30 days after you suffer your disabling sickness or injury and suffer a loss of income. You then need to wait 30 days before you can receive a payment. Umm, in the 90 days is of course 90 days before you can receive a payment in an insured event.
[12 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. 30 days, please.
[12 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so 30 days all got done. So 90 days is the cheaper option as you've got a longer waiting period. Just to explain umm, but the 30 days of course more expense does it's a shorter time you have to wait. So you just to double check it's the 30 days.
[12 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : You'd like me to quote you one, OK. And then there's the benefits period. The benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for, for anyone injury or illness. You have the options from six months, one year, two years or five years. Which benefit.
[12 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : So that was your maximum amount you can pay for it, right?
[12 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Would you like me to select the maximum amount of time for anyone, injury or illness that we will pay the monthly benefit?
[13 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : That one, I'm so confused.
[13 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : That's alright. Let me clarify.
[13 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Mm. Hmm.
[13 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : To say, for example, you suffer a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. OK, it's time to claim you've waited your waiting period and you start receiving your monthly benefit amount from us.
[13 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, correct.
[13 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : If you have a one year benefit.
[13 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Mm Hmm.
[13 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : We will pay you a monthly benefit for one year only because that is your benefit.
[13 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[13 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : That is the length of time you've chosen to receive the monthly benefit.
[13 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, just one year. Just one year.
[13 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : If you choose five years and you're you're off work five years. But does that make sense? So does that clarify that?
[13 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, Correct. Correct. This one. Yeah. Because I don't know, need to be like sitting at home something.
[13 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Alright, OK, so it, it, it's the one year you'd like to go with.
