Any advice I provide is limited to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they're suitable for your needs. We do not consider your personal circumstances. But as well, thank you so much for placing that inquiry on our website just so I can have that better understanding. Do you currently have some income protection insurance in place?

It's designed to provide a monthly income benefit paid directly to you if you are unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. It's designed to help cover your bills and living costs if your salary is interrupted for the cover. You can apply if you work at least 15 hours per week in paid employment. What we offer is an income benefit of up to 75% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. With the process. We keep it nice and simple for you as everything's done over the phone. There's no forms for you to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete. We just simply go through some health and lifestyle questions and it just determines the pricing and the terms of the policy. Once that it's in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the policy document. And then also please keep in mind that premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible depending on the policy structure, which could make it even more cost effective for you.

I just want to make sure that amount is suitable for you because with the 2000, you can choose like if it was a waiting period of 90 days, it can lower the premium as well in terms of the cover. Just want to check though, was at 2026 Eighty 5, was that still in the price range that was affordable for you? Yeah, no problem.

If it was something that you'd like to definitely speak about to your family and loved ones and definitely understand that we do have an option where if it was just wanting to read over some documents and speak to some of the family members, we can still cover you from today as you're not required to make any upfront payments for the policy. But there in the meantime, we send these documents to your home address and e-mail address for you to sit down and review with them. And with the policy, it's not like a lock in contract. So if you ever had a change in mind, you can always call us back and apply to have it cancelled. But as you mentioned, you didn't have any cover in place. Meanwhile whilst doing that, we can definitely cover you whilst reading it. Did that sound like a suitable option as well?
[30 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's, that's what I was talking about. Yeah. I have to like have some conversation with my family 1st and then yeah, that's that's the one. I mean, yeah, that's the one.
[30 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, beautiful. Umm, we can do umm, so that that option John, I was mentioning where we can set up your cover whilst you are speaking to them as well. So that was what I was mentioning. Umm, we don't require you to make any upfront payments for the cover, but in the meantime we send the documents to you and your family to your home address and e-mail address for you to sit down and review. And with the cover, if you thought it was no longer suitable for you and you can always call us back and apply to have it canceled.
[31 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[31 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : But whilst speaking to them, you have that protection and cover in place as well. We do have that option for you.
[31 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah, that'd be great.
[31 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Did that sound suitable? Did that sound suitable, setting it up while speaking to them and reading over the information?
[31 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's yeah, yeah.
[31 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we can definitely do that for you. In terms of the benefits we also include, I'd like to let you know that the included in the policy is a rehabilitation benefit which can assist you to return to work and with premiums. So that's the amount for the insurance. Your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. And in addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will increase by 3% until you reach the maximum benefit of $15,000 per month with associated increases in premium. You can update at this indexation each year, but umm John, as mentioned, what we can do is as mentioned, we can get you covered from today, but no payments will have to come out until a day that's suitable for you, whether that's in a week's time, 2 weeks time or three weeks time. We're very flexible in that aspect. But we're going to send the documents to your home address and e-mail address for you to review the policy. It does give a 30 day cooling off.
