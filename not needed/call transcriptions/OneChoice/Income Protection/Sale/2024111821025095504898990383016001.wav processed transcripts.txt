[5 seconds][Agent] : Hey, good morning. It's Abraham calling back from One Choice Insurance.
[9 seconds][Customer] : Hi, how are you?
[10 seconds][Agent] : Hey, not too bad. How how are you going again today?
[14 seconds][Customer] : Not so good.
[15 seconds][Agent] : That's very good to hear. The phone just disconnected a bit earlier, but we'll just give me that call back to help you do that in income protection insurance inquiry just so I can do that for you. What was your first and surname again? Beautiful. And then just your date of birth.
[26 seconds][Customer] : Michael Jackson, 27th of October 1987.
[33 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And then just with residency in New Zealand. Can I confirm that you are a male New Zealand resident currently residing in New Zealand? Lovely and just with our calls. Please note all our calls are recorded. Any advice to provide is limited to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they're suitable for your needs. We do not consider your personal circumstances, but Michael, lovely to speak to you again today in terms of income protection. And just so I can have a bit of a better understanding, was this your first time looking into this coverage? Yeah, no, that's understandable. What I'll do is I'll explain how it all works with the main features and benefits. We'll run through some pricing, but if you do have any questions about anything in particular, please don't hesitate to ask me as well. But with the coverage, it's designed to provide a monthly income benefit paid directly to you if you are unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer the loss. So suffer loss of income. The way it's designed is to help cover the bills and living costs if your salary was interrupted.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : You can apply if you at least work 15 hours per week in paid employment, but the amount of cover we offer it's an income benefit of up to 75% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of 15,000. It's a nice simple process. In applying we don't require to do like any medical checks or complete any blood tests.
[1 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Mm, Hmm.
[1 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : We just have some health and lifestyle questions that determine the final pricing. But once it is in place it will cover you into your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the policy document. But with income protection, a great feature market is the premiums are generally tax deductible. So depending on the policy structure, I could even make it more cost effective for you at tax time.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : But what we'll do is we'll go through some questions in regards to some of your work Judy's. But if you don't mind me asking, what do you currently do for work market?
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK. I'm a quanted surveyor.
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : You said quantity survey.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Lovely. And how long have you been doing this type of work for?
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Four years. Five.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Boy is beautiful and enjoying enjoying the type of work as well.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, it's quite stressful, but it's quite challenging as well.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yep, definitely understandable with that one. Well, glad to hear you are as well. Enjoying it. Can understand what the stresses would work. My mind does come with it too for sure. But what we'll do is we'll go through those questions together just before answering any of our questions. It is important that you're aware of your duty to answer all of our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your cover claims time. But the first one's just going to ask, do you work 15 hours or more per week? Yes or no?
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : So, yeah, yeah, yes.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Is your role of administrative, managerial or professional nature? Will you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment?
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Uh, just in the office at the moment.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Just in the office? That's alright.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Would that be yes, Yes to that question, no problem. And with those type of duties, are you required to perform any physical duties?
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes. Uh, no.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. And do you work in any of the following fields, aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces, or do you carry a firearm or hear the explosives? That's OK. That's all that's required for the duty space. But in terms of smoking status, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Uh, no, no.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK, very healthy choice. But in terms of employment status with your role, are you currently employed or self-employed?
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Uh, employed. Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : No problem. Well thank you for those details. What I'll do is determine how much cover we can offer you and provide you with the definition of pre tax income.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Well, pre tax income is a total annual remiration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses. However, excluding employer, Kiwi Saver and super contributions. But based on those details, what is your annual pre tax income? I'm so sorry it was just a bit faint.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yes, 108000 108,000 Yes.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : I heard one 408 K no problem. So I'll put 108,000 as the annual amount and thank you for those details. But based on your duties and income, you can select the monthly benefit amount from $1000 up to a maximum of $6750 as that monthly amount. In terms of the cost, Mark, that would be like if you've got any mortgages, groceries, family, umm, expenses, but umm, what amount would you like me to quote you on? What would be a suitable amount to fit into that budget?
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, probably the Max one, Yeah, because I have mortgage, yeah.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's understandable. I'll leave it at the maximum amount there for you. But you also have the option to select different waiting periods and benefit periods with the waiting period as the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Which waiting period would you like me to select for you?
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : What, what are the options for today?
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So there's either a 30 day waiting period or a 90 day waiting period as well.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : 90 days? Yeah. Could you do the third, the 630 and 90? I just wanted to know what's the difference.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, I can definitely let you know both differences. But with the benefit. Is a maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. You can choose six months, one year, two years or even five years as that duration of time. But which benefit. Would you like me to select for yourself for the illness year?
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, for the illness, what's the options?
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : You've got a six month wait, sorry, six month benefit. One years as that time. If you'd like 2 years, that's an option as well. We also have five years too.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Could you do that? So what what you meant by the five years for for that five years I'm affected by an illness, is that what you're saying?
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So this the benefit PE Yeah, that benefit.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injured illness. So if there was an injured illness that did last that duration of five years, you could do five years or if you think it could only take one year to get back to work or two years.
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Probably just just six months will be fine, I reckon.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : It's all, it's all entirely up to you six months and that's OK. I'll leave six months on that one for you. And then I've just left that waiting period as 30 days and then I'll adjust that to 90 days so that you know what that would be as well. But Michael, this is the estimated price so far. The final pricing is determined through those health and lifestyle questions. But if we're looking at $6750, that's that monthly amount, waiting period of 30 days, benefit period of six months.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Fortnightly, it'd be coming in at $35.55 a fortnight so far for that amount of coverage.
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And then if we looked at the 90 days as a waiting period, it does drop the premiums down to $18.25 a fortnight.
[7 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, $18.00, yeah.
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : If you 1825 to 90 days, that's the benefit. Six months, correct.
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : So if ever, sorry, so that is only for six months, say, yeah, yeah, OK. So if you do it for one year, like the 30 days, 90 days for one year, how much would that cost?
[8 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : One year, yeah.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So if I did it for 90 days and one year, that would then be $22.46 a fortnight. But again, this is this is the indicative price, the estimated price. What we'll do together is go through those questions to get you a final outcome.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : That is 4/9, OK.
[8 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : But so far, was it sounding suitable that one year and then waiting period of 90 days?
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that would be. I reckon that would be fine, yeah.
[8 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : That's OK, I'll just leave it at that so far. But we'll go through those questions. I've just got to read to you a paragraph that just says in terms of your answers to the questions, it says please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes.

Please answer yes or no for each of the following. Chest pain, high cholesterol, OK. And then it just asks, have you ever had a cholesterol blood test with the result greater than or equal to 7.0 millimols per liter? That's OK. If it is greater than, I'd have to answer yes to it. But if it was less than 7.0, you can answer no to that one.
