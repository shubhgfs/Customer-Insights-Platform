[11 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So based on on your referral information, so we did disclose your hernia. So the the specific application says no benefit will be payable for any disability, condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to or arising from hiatus hernia. So if it if the surgery surgery is in regards to the hernia itself, it wouldn't, it wouldn't be paid out.
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no. OK.
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, for the hernia, just for the hernia itself.
[11 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : So the yeah.
[11 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So for the hiatus hernia, it wouldn't be paid out. Yeah, in regards to the hernia. But in terms of that, let's say for example, if you were to go for surgery other than for that hernia itself, it would be paid out.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, OK, OK. Good, good question, good answer.
[11 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, of course.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Another thing, what about if there's a loss of employment through like low? You know know what?
[12 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Will that work? So specifically how the income just I thought that's a very good question. So specifically how the income protection works is we will pay a monthly benefit, income benefit paid directly to you if you are unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer loss of income. So it doesn't cover if there was low work. Yeah.
[12 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, nice. OK.
[12 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Well, were there any other questions you had for me there just?
[12 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK. No, no.

[12 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 3200.
[13 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : That's for the 3200. So last time I quit, umm, I looked at the $4500 for you with the, with the waiting period of 30 days and the MO benefit period of six months, it was $118.32 a fortnight. Whereas for the $3200.00 with the waiting period of 30 days and the benefit period of six months, it was $84.14 a fortnight. Yeah. Which one were you more lean towards for yourself? The address Fr the 3200.
[13 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[13 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. No worries. So I just want to clear up some a bit of information for yourself as well. The address Fr. So I also wanted to let you know that included in your policies, in your policy is a rehabilitation benefit which can assist you to return to work. So specifically the rehabilitation benefit which pays an additional reimbursement of to 50% of your monthly income benefit. So a maximum of 3000 to help with rehabilitation costs whilst claiming or we can reimburse up to six times your income benefit toward cost of equipment or modifications required to assist you to return assist you return to work. So Joseph, your premium is steps which means it will generate increase each year as you age.

Maximum benefit of $15,000 per month with associated increases in premium. You can opt out of this automatic indexation each year. So I just want to clarify with all these details with yourself at yourself.
