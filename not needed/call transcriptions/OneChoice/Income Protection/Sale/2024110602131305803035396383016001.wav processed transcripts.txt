[2 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Hello.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : So I just want to know what is that? How much it's going to cost me?
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely. We can safely go through that one there. I can see here when you took out your life, your life insurance with us, income protection was wasn't something that we had quite launched yet. But now that we have got income protection, that's why you're wanting to look into it. Yep. Beautiful. Is there anything come in particular that you're needing the income protection to cover? I mean, is it more so to help you cover your day-to-day living expenses if you're unable to work or is that to help, you know, maintain those mortgage repayments? What is it that you're needing the income protection for more specifically to help to help keep up with the mortgage repayments?
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Mortgage, yes.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yes, fantastic. And you know, that's sort of essentially what our income protection is designed to do. So here one choice with that income protection, it's there to provide you with a monthly benefit that is paid directly out to you if you're unable to work due to a disabling illness or injury and you would just suffer that loss of income. So we actually pay this money out to you as what's called a lump sum payment. So you're able to use that on whatever you need. So whether it's how helping you sort of take care of your day-to-day living expenses, whether it's helping you maintain any mortgage or loan repayments or obligations that you may have the choice. And again, it is entirely up to yourself there. OK, beautiful. Now with this fund here, we actually offer an income benefit amount of up to 75% of your monthly pre tax income amount. So this generally ranges between, umm, $1000 being the lowest up to a maximum of $15,000 being the highest.
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, now with this one here, uh, when it comes to applying for income protection, it is still something that is very easy and very simple for yourself to do. So, so much like the life insurance, we don't require you to go down to the doctors and undergo any types of physical medical checks or get any sort of blood test done. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take you through a series of health and lifestyle questions over the phone. What this is going to do is it's gonna help us determine your eligibility for the cut up and also what the final premium on that one is going to be. Now, once you do have that income protection cover in place, we are going to cover you up until the policy anniversary that follows your 65th birthday. So the income protection will end, umm, on that policy anniversary that follows your 65th birthday. Please keep in mind that there are some exclusions as that apply and they will be outlined in your policy document that we do send out to yourself. OK, right now when it comes to the premiums here at Income Protection, uh, you are going to find that they are generally tax deductible depending on your policy structure. So that could make it even more cost effective for yourself. Of course, we'd always advise that you should speak to a tax professional, umm, to find out more in terms of that one. OK?
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. So that's a little bit about what it's sort of designed to do. What we're gonna do now is we're gonna go through and generate a quote for yourself. So I do need to ask you some questions in regards to Judy's at work. So First off and foremost, so I do want to let you know before answering any of our questions, umm, it is important you are aware of your duty to answer all of our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so can impact your coverage claims time.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.

So when it comes to your pre tax income, what that one is, is it's the your pre tax income is the total annual remarration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses.

[12 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So your pre tax income amount annually is $105,000.
[12 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[12 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. OK, so based on that one there, what level of cover we're able to look for you as a monthly benefit amount at ranges between $1000 being the lowest up to a monthly, up to a maximum monthly benefit amount to 6562 dollars. So we work in $1000 increment. So from 100, sorry, from 1000 it goes up to 1101 thousand, 203 hundred and so on up to that month with maximum monthly benefit amount is $6562.00. What amount are you wanting to look at there 4000? So you want your monthly benefit amount to be around $4000 a month.
[13 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : 4000, yes.
[13 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Now what we're going to do now is look at the waiting period. I'm sorry. You also have the option to add on different waiting periods and benefit periods depends on on your own personal circumstances. So let's go ahead and have a look at those ones there for you now. So First off and foremost, the waiting period as the non payment period, you must wait before the income benefit is payable to you after the insured event. So you can choose either a 30 day or 90 day waiting period. Which waiting period are you wanting to look at? 30 Perfect. Now we also have the benefit. So the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone and real illness. So you can choose a benefit period of six months, one year, two years or five years. What benefit.

[14 minutes][Customer] : 30 What is this for the 100?
[14 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So the benefit. Is the amount of time that we're gonna pay you pay you that monthly benefit for anyone injury or illness. So say for an example, you choose a one year benefit. OK, and you would, uh, break your leg and you're off work for six months. We would pay you for that six months because you have a one year benefit. Say for an example, though, you have a one year benefit. And you break your leg and you're off work for let's just say 15 months, we will only pay you for that 12 month period because you only have a one year benefit.
[15 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[15 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Does that make sense?
[15 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that makes sense.
[15 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. OK. So it's just the benefit. That's just how long we will pay you for anyone injury or illness. OK.

So it is a very simple application with majority of my questions being just yes or no questions, of course, unless prompted otherwise. But First off and foremost, I do need to read to you our pre underwriting disclosure.

[35 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : That's, that's OK. I understand you're wanting to work out a little bit of a budget, but out of those two figures that we've gone through, is there one that's sounding more better suited for your budget? Is it the lower level of cover or would it be that full 4000?
[35 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No, 4001 will be fine.
[35 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Now I do also want to let you know in terms of this one here we also include with your cover what's called a rehabilitation, umm, benefit. OK, so how that rehab so this can help assist you, umm, in return in your return to work there. So how the rehabilitation benefit works as it says to pay an additional reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit amount up to a maximum of $3000. And this can be used to help in any sort of rehabilitation costs whilst you're claiming. Or what we can also do is reimburse up to six times your income benefit towards the cost of things such as equipment or modifications that will be required to assist you in returning to work there. OK, now with this one here, I do also want to let you know your premium is set, which means it will generally increase as your age. In addition, this policy has what's called an automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will increase by 3% until you reach the maximum benefit amount of 15,000 per month with associated increases in premium. And you can opt out of this indexation each each year. So each year round your policy anniversary, of course, much like the life insurance, we will send you out a letter saying this is what the new sum insured is going to be with associated increases in premium. And of course, you cannot doubt of that one each year there.
[37 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[37 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So look, there are a couple of options that I do have available for you there today. Now I know you have said at this stage the $4000 worth of cover at 5392 per fortnight is affordable for you. You're just wanting to go through and do a final review of your budget. So there are a couple of options that I do have available for you. Keep in mind of course we can definitely look at sending you through just that basic information and pricing there for you to review or one of the other alternate of options that we do have available for yourself. Being that we have got that cover fully approved and you have said that that fortnightly premium is affordable. I am able to give you that little bit of Peace of Mind and that little bit of financial security by actually looking at getting some cover set up and in place with yourself today without any upfront payments or upfront costs. What we of course do is we note down our preferred payment day and payment method that is suitable for you in the near future from Yeah, what I didn't do is I sent you out an e-mail. Well I read you out a quick declaration and I sent you out an e-mail included with all your policy documents as well as a postal copy of your documents. So the e-mail copy you'll receive generally within the next hour or so. The postal copy you'll take around about 5 to 10 business days. That will be whilst you are sitting down and doing a final review of the budget. You have got that little bit of Peace of Mind that there is that would have been protection in place. Now in terms of this one here, if you didn't decide that the cup is not suitable for you or you simply just wish to cancel, all you then need to do is give us a call and apply to do so. It is a very simple process there. There's no cancellation fees or no locking contracts or anything like that. I'd also want to advise you as well there Joe, that this policy gives you what's called a 30 day cooling off. So if you decide to cancel within those 30 days, you will receive a full refund of any premiums you may have paid. This is of course, unless a claim has been made. How does that sound?
[39 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Sounds good.
[39 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So the next step here is we need to note down that preferred payment date and payment method. So Joe, in terms of this one here, of course we wouldn't actually take any payments off you today. As a business we do generally like to try and collect payment within the next 7 days. However, is there a date that would best suit yourself?
[40 minutes][Customer] : Is that possible? You can do with the same insurance you are deducting.
[40 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So we can definitely make it come out on the same day as your life insurance. Keep in mind it would be a separate payment. OK, so I can see here your next payment for your life insurance is next week Thursday, is that correct? Yep. So is that correct there? You pay every second Thursday.
[40 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK, yes.
[40 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So we can make the first payment come out on Thursday the 14th and then it will come every second Thursday thereafter. Now, George, for your security, I actually do not have access to your current payment details, so I would need to get those off you again. So we can do this either by a Visa debit, Visa MasterCard or credit card, or I can use your bank account number for a direct debit. What one best suits you? And the name on your bank account is under Jyot Singh. J Singh what 1 Jyot Singh or J Singh?
[40 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Direct debit, yes, Justin, the both of them.
[41 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you.
[41 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Justin, that is SBS.
[41 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : SBS is the bank perfect?
[41 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, the SBS.
[41 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : And what is what is your bank account number there please?
[41 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Hold on please.
[41 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : That's OK, Take your time.
[41 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[41 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[41 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : The account is 031369073282000.
[41 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So 0313690732820 suffix 00 and that's you said it was with SBS, correct? Perfect. OK, So in order to finish setting up this payment with you now I do need to ask you 4 quick questions and redo a short declaration. And I just need a click yes or no at the ends of each there.
[41 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, OK.
[42 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, so question number one, it does say here do you have authority to operate this bank account alone?
[42 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[42 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Question #2 have you cancelled a direct debit authority? 4, Have you cancelled a direct? Oh, sorry, let me reread that. The next one is do you have the authority? Do you need to directly authorize debits?
