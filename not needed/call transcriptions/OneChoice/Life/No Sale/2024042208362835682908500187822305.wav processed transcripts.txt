So if you decide that this policy is not suitable for you and you choose to cancel within those 30 days, then you will receive a full refund of your premium unless a claim has been made.

You have a 30 day calling off. During which you may cancel your policy and any premium you may have paid will be refunded in full unless you have lodged a claim. Finally, if you have any questions about policy or you wish to lodge a complaint, please contact your first on 0100 double 05804 or e-mail support@onechoice.co dot NZ. Now showing just two last questions for you. Now first question, do you understand and agree with the declaration? I've just read you yes or no? Thank you. And would you like any other information about the insurance now or would you like me to read any part of the policy document to you? No, thank you.
[27 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yes, no, thank you.
[27 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful. So that's been all completed for you now. Congratulations and welcome to the One Choice family. Now shown within up to 15 minutes time, you'll be receiving your policy documents by on your e-mail. Just try checking your spam or junk folder as well. Given that it comes from a no reply e-mail, it can sometimes fall under there. Otherwise, within 5 to 10 business days, you'll also receive these policy documents by post. Now, one of the last few pages of the policy documents is a beneficiary nominations form, so you can choose up to five beneficiaries. So if you wanted to have, you know, umm, your two girls and Nikki as beneficiaries, you can most happily do so. All you have to do is just fill that form out and send it back to us just so we know who to give the money to when it comes to claims time.
[28 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Perfect.
[28 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful. Apart from all of that there, Shawn, is there anything else I can help you with today?

[28 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Good stuff. Thank you very much.
[28 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : No worries. That's OK then. Shawn, thank you so much for choosing one choice. It was a pleasure speaking with you. Enjoy the rest of your afternoon. You too.
