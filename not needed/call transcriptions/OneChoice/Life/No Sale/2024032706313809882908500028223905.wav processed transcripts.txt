[20 seconds][Agent] : Hi, good afternoon. It's Dania here calling from One Choice Life Insurance. How are you today?
[19 seconds][Customer] : No, thank you.
[28 seconds][Agent] : That's very good to hear. I'm giving you a call back today so we can finish going through that life insurance inquiry there for yourself. I have heard back from the underwriters there from yesterday. So would you please be able to confirm for me again, first name, last name and date of birth?
[46 seconds][Customer] : Push for Saint Hondo 291289.
[49 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. I do need to reconfirm again that you are in effect of course, a male New Zealand resident who is currently residing in New Zealand. Perfect now placed. Not all calls are recorded. Any of us I provide is limited to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they are suitable for your needs.
[57 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : We do not consider your personal circumstances. OK, Now I have got here. So we emailed the underwriters to say in regards to your occupation, umm, because we weren't, we weren't quite sure on what to capture that under. Umm the underwriter based on what we've disclosed to them have come back and said they're happy for me to capture under retail manager, no manual. OK, even though you said you do about 10% manual, they are happy to put it down as retail manager, no manual.
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So let's enter that one and so that we can finish taking you through the total permanent disability and serious illness option. I do need to reconfirm, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[1 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : No.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you so much for that. All right, now with this one here, we looked at $500,000 worth of our life of that came in at a fortnightly payment of $17.88. Now I do need to reconfirm again, do you work a minimum of 20 hours per week? Perfect. In case and we're popping your, uh, your occupation on the retail manager, no manual. So I'm just popping that one and, and they are for you now. So what's that silent permanent disability cover? It's also known as TPC.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, so how the TPC cover works?
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Is it say to pay a lump sum benefit in the that you were to suffer the loss of limbs or site or unable to work for a period of six consecutive months and they're not able to return to work in any field but you are experienced, educated or trained or if you were to suffer the loss of independent existence there OK now there is an exclusion under this under this cover for any intentional self-inflicted injury. Please just be aware that any payment made under total and permanent disability cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount. If you also purchase a serious illness cover, the serious illness benefit amount will also when you have a successful TPC claim there. OK now with that selling permanent disability cover you can choose anywhere between $50,000 up to a total of $500,000.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : What amount would you like me to start the quotes on for you today?
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm gonna pay 500 calls on the go.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, we can look at 500,000. So keep in mind as well as we discussed, if you also just keep in mind that please be aware that any payment made under sale and permanent disability cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount. So keep in mind as well, if you have 500,000 life, 500,000 TPD, you claim that 500,000 TPD, then your life insured amount becomes 0. OK, so for $500,000 worth of asylum permanent disability cover, you'd be looking at an additional $12.12 per fortnight, which gives you a combined total of $30 a fortnight. How does that sound?
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK that sounds a lot.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : That's OK, we can look at reducing the TPD cover down so you have another particular amount of mind.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Can be 200,000.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : You'd look like to look at 300,000. Perfect. Alright, so if we brought the TPD down to 300,000, you'd be looking at an additional $4.85 per fortnight, which gives you a combined total of $22.73. How does that sound? Yeah.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Slightly better than $30.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Did you want to, did you want to go down a little bit more? Are we happy with that 300 TPD?
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm OK with 200,000.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : You're happy with that? Perfect. And so what's this one here? Are you happy for me to add this optional cover to your clothes?
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. All right now let's have a look at the serious illness option as well. So it's a serious illness option. What they want you to do is just need to pay a lump sum benefit if you were to suffer an an insured events covered under this policy. Now the funds can be used in any way you see fits assisted in any rehabilitation costs or if an income replacement is you're recovering the insured events under this policy are heart attack, cancer, stroke, or if you were to to the coronary bypass surgery. Now each of these different each of these have been defined within the policy and each claim is assisted against this definition.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : None.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : I'd also need to let you know that there are exclusions on the policy so any insured have been set become apparent before or during the first three months of the serious illness option commencing will not be covered. Full details of all exclusions are set out in your policy document. Please also be aware that any payment made under serious illness cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount. If you also purchase the total and permanent disability cover, the TPC benefit amount will also reduce when you have a successful serious onus claim.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : None.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So say for an example you have 50,000 serious onus, 500,000 life, you claim the 50,000 serious onus and your life insured amount would become 450,000 there. OK so for the serious onus option I can quote you anywhere between $50,000 being the lowest up to $250,000 being the highest. Do you have a particular amount in mind you'd like me to start the quotes on for that one for you?
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Probably I'll just leave the series in this one.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So you just want to stick with child and permanent disability and the life cover, I think we can definitely do that there for you. So for $500,000, what life plus $200,000 worth of that CPC, that one is you're looking at $22.73 per fortnight. Yeah, I do want to remind you that the this pricing is an indicative only and the final premiums in terms of our policy, it is actually dependent on the outcome of the health and lifestyle application which I'm able to take you through now. It is a very simple application location that we do over the phone with most of our questions just being yes or no questions only. So First off and foremost, I do need to get your address please as starting with your post code.
[8 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Is it possible for me to just have the life cover and for my wife can I get both of them? Oh, no, no. Even another price will be cheaper. But that is it possible to cover that way?
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So as we discussed yesterday, we don't actually do joint policies in case yes. So you want to look at TPD for your wife as well?
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, but I just want to look a live cover for myself and then PPP for my wife and a live cover for her. No, not yes.
[8 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, So you don't want TPD cover for yourself, you just want life cover for OK, so that's OK, we can remove the TPD for yourself. So you just want to look at $500,000 worth of life cover for yourself at $17.88 a fortnight. Perfect. OK, so let's go through and finish doing your one first and then I can go through and do your wife. It's just if I have to go into separate policies, separate profiles. So let's go through and finish your one off 1st and then I can go in and look at your wife and adding CPD on to that one.
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah.
[9 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So before I go through the application with you, I do need to get your address please starting with your postcard.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : So now understandable question, does that increase or does that stays that permanently?
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So you are going to find that your premiums are stamped which means they will generally increase each year. However, how your premiums, what how your premiums and your cover would look like for you in the future is again depends on on the outcome of the health and lifestyle application. So as as we discussed earlier on the final premiums in terms of our policy again is dependent on the outcome of the health and lifestyle application. So I wouldn't be able to answer more of those questions for you until after we have gone through that application.

[22 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No.
[22 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful.

[22 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : No.
[22 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, you and me both. So that's all the questions that I do need to ask you there. OK, so first of and foremost, I do want to let you know very big congratulations your application for our life cover, it actually has been fully approved. So that was the $500,000 worth of cover that we applied for at the fortnightly payments of $17.88. So big congratulations. There's been absolutely no changes made to the pricing. So that's the the best outcome that we're able to get there for yourself. Now what that does mean there is during the first of what this done does mean here for you is we're actually going to provide you with that little bit of a needs here and upfront detection there, OK. So we're going to cover you immediately for this due to any cause except for suicide and the 1st 13 months. OK. Now we also include with that cover what's called a similarly ill advanced payment.
[23 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : None.
[23 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So how that similarly ill advanced payment works as if you were unfortunately diagnosed with 12 months relief to live by a medical practitioner. We're going to pay your claim out to you. And so, so we pay this out to you whilst just a living and you have to be able to use that on whatever you need to, you know, whether there was any sort of treatment cost, whether you wanted to spend a little bit extra time with loved ones, check off a bucket list, the choice is entirely up to yourself there.
[24 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : None.
[24 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Now I do want to let you know, I know you did ask this question before we went through the underwriting application. So I do want to let you know that your premium is stitched. So what that means is that we'll generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has what's called an automatic indexation.
[24 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : I'll do that. I'll do that.
[24 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So what that one means for yourself is, uh, each year your benefit amount will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium.
[24 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : I'll do that.
[24 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : And you can actually opt out of this indexation each year. So each year around your policy anniversary, we are going to send you out a letter saying this is what your new sum insured is going to be with associated increases in premium. And you can actually opt out of that one each year there. OK.
[25 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : What's the option of opting out for the second?
[25 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yes, I'll, I'll give you an idea of what it would look like if you opt out of if you were to accept or decline the indexation, OK, that they may make it a little bit, they make it a little bit easier there for you. So I do want to let you know, please be aware that all of our premium projections are indicative only and assume that you do not make any amendments to your cover. As an example, if you do not decline indexation on your policy, the premium payable in your following year of cover would be $18.63 per fortnight and your benefit amount will increase to $525,000, OK.
[26 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : None.
[25 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Now if you were to decline the indexation, the premium payable and your following year of cover would be $17.88 and your benefit amount will remain at $500,000 there. OK? Perfect. Does that make a little bit more sense now that I've explained it that way? Perfect. OK, so you can, again, you can opt out of that indexation each year. So say make sure you decide to accept that the following two years you want to decline it and then in the fourth year you want to accept it. You can do so. That choice is entirely up to yourself on how many times you accept or decline it.
[26 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Now with this one here, sorry. That is how the cover works, the pricing, everything like that. So what I'm able to do for yourself before we go through into your wife's fund is I'm actually able to get yourself immediately covered over the phone today on that $500,000 policy without any upfront payments or upfront costs. What we actually do is we note down both a payment site and payment method that is suitable for you in the near future. Now in saying that this policy, see here it does, it should give you what's called a 30 day calling off.
[27 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : None.
[27 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So during that time we would have sent you out all your personalized policy documents for you to review. You're actually going to receive 2 copies. You'll receive an e-mail copy today, that'll be generally within the next hour or so. And then you'll receive a postal copy. That one you're going to receive within the next 5 to 10 business days for you to sit down and review. Now, should you then just like to cancel within those 30 days, you will actually receive a full refund of any premiums you may have paid during that time, of course, unless a claim has been made.
[27 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : None.
[27 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So again, of course, we're not actually going to take any payments off you today, however as a business we do generally like to try and collect payment within the next 7 days. However, when would be more suitable for you?
[28 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Umm, just on my other policy gets cancelled automatically or how does that work?
[28 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Umm, I mean in terms of, in terms of that one, that's something you would need to discuss with your current provider, umm, on how that process does work. I can't actually comment on other policies as we did discuss in our previous phone call as well. We are, we do advise if you are looking at replacing an existing policy, we do recommend that you do not cancel it until you have repeat this policy in full as it may not be identical to your existing cover.
[28 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[28 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Uh, but in terms of that one, yeah, you that's something you'd need to discuss with your current provider. I can't actually comment on that one there. I'm sorry, uh, but what's this one here? Is there a day that you'd like the first payment to come out for this one?
[28 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[28 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : You'd you'd like this one to start when sorry.
[28 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : The only thing is, whenever I can cancel the other one, I'll prefer this one to start the very next year when I can when the other one is cancelled because I don't know what time frame they'll need.
[29 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's that's OK. I understand that one there. Keep in mind I can push that payment back a little bit more as need to be.
[29 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Fortnite please.
[29 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Umm, do you know, do you know, do you currently pay your one fortnightly or monthly fortnightly? OK. When's your next fortnightly payment due for that one? Sorry, on what date? The 24th of last month.
[29 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : And last one went off on 24th of October 24th, yeah.
[30 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So that means your next one is due on the 7th. What we can so is we can stretch the following payment out to say the 21st and that would give you enough time to contact your current provider and and just go and go through that. How does that one sound? If we were to push that payment out to the 21st, would that be suitable for you?
[30 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Just want to check what's the normally cancellation. Do they have a month or they have a few weeks or?
[30 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Umm, I'm, I'm, I'm not sure I, I, again, I can't comment on other providers. Umm, I don't know what the cancellation time frame is. I know with us here at one Choice, you just give us a call. Our customer support department will walk you through the steps of what needs to be done. We just request, umm, written confirmation that you're wanting to cancel the policy.
[30 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK. Maybe we'll start from 1st of December. So give us a bit of time so I can cancel that one in case they have a bit of lead time.
[30 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : I I don't know if I can push the payment back that far. Just let me see. I'm just having a look to see if I because usually it's generally 28 to 30 days. So I just want to check, just double check to see if I can push the payment back that far.
[31 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's fine. Should be.
[31 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, So the furthest I can push it back to is the 30th, perfect. OK. Do you like a more? Do you need her? OK, So the first payment will come out on Thursday the 30th of November and then it'll be every second Thursday thereafter. Now just keep in mind the policy documents that I'm going to send out to you are just going to say the 15th is that's the furthest I can physically push it back.
