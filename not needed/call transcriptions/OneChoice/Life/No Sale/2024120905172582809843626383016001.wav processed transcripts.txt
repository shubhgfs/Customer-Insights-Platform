[4 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : And what it is simply designed to do is provide your uncle with that Peace of Mind that if he was to pass away, we would pay that money out to his loved ones to help not only for funeral expenses but any other final expenses as well. Now with that, your uncle, he can nominate up to five beneficiaries there to receive this benefit amount. And if death was due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple. OK.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah. Now in terms of applying there, so it's quite easy. There are no medical checks and acceptance is guaranteed if you are a New Zealand resident currently residing in New Zealand and age between 18 and 79. And your uncle does fall within that category there.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yes, excellent.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So that's wonderful, beautiful. Now in terms of the coverage itself. So for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Only after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause. And when I say you, I do mean your uncle. And yeah.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Ah, I see one more.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : And then in addition to this as well for your uncle, there is a terminal illness benefit as well, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if your uncle was first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to lift by a medical practitioner, we pay the benefit amount in full.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Wow. Yes.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK, After his benefic to him OK, OK you too.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : So that's 30,000. OK.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So yeah so that whichever benefit in that you choose, so it you now you can choose between 3000 up to $30,000.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : How much is the 30,000?
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So what benefit amount would you like for me to put you on 1st 30,000 Good question let's have a look.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Might be more expensive huh? Because his because of his age, they might calculate on his age.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So we do calculate it based on age.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, I am. Why?
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So for 30, Yeah, So it's for 30,000. I'm sorry, just to confirm before we go ahead, I know you're talking to someone else, which is completely OK, but are they also listening in on this phone call? OK, No, no, no stress Outlook.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, no.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah, no worries at all. No stress.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So we have for $30,000 of funeral cover there, you would be looking at a fortnightly premium of $79.75 per Fort. Not there.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : I see. So that's 79.
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So that's $79.75, Yeah, Yeah.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Oh my God.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So it's SE $79.75 per fortnight there. So how's that sounding there for yourself? And that's for 30,000? Yep.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : To be honest its quite really expensive because I am currently paying for my own insurance policy and also I am also paying for my husbands one too.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yes, yeah, Sandra did brief me on that as well. So that's not sure at all. We did look at 30,000 which was the highest we can go. So we can look at a lower benefit amount as well. Just find something that may be a bit more within your price range there for you. So would you like for me to?
[7 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, can you?
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : What else would you like for me to look at potentially 20,000 or Yep, yeah, beautiful.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I was going to ask you how How about if we go for 2020 thousand?
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Let's have a look at 20,000. So for $20,000 of funeral cover, you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $53.17 per fortnight, which equates to about $3.18 per day. So how's that sounding there for yourself? So the bit. So what was your price range that you originally had planned? So per fortnight. So not per week? Per fortnight, yeah.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that store, so 'cause my husband's cover is his one for 30,000, it is $39.00, so roughly around $40.00.
[9 minutes][Agent] : Yeah.
[9 minutes][Customer] : So that's the price range that I am able to afford if it's.
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Afford. OK.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, if it's for.
[9 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : And I'm assuming and correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm assuming your husband would be quite a bit younger than your uncle, is that correct? Yeah. OK. And then and then you said you were paying for yours as well, correct?
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that is definitely true, Correct.
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK. And then once again, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm also assuming that you would be a lot younger than your uncle as well, like similar in age to your husband. Yeah. OK.
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, actually. I'm younger than my husband too.
[9 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : You're younger than your husband is. OK. So that may potentially be why most of your guys was a little bit cheaper there. So let's have a look at potentially 15,000. So you said your price range was about the 40 mark. So let me have a look. So would you ha like me to have a look around 15,000?
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yes, sure, sure. If that's OK.
[9 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, of course, of course. OK, beautiful. So for $15,000 of cover, you would be looking at a fortnightly premium of $39.88 per fortnight there. So is that one sounding a bit more affordable and within the price range?
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : But that's 15 thou. Sorry. That's yeah, that's 15,000, eh?
[10 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, correct. That is for $15,000 of cover. Now with this as well, keeping in mind that your premiums are level, which means they are designed to stay consistent year on year. And then for your uncle there, when he reaches the age of 85, your premiums will cease, which means you will stop paying premiums. And then we will add a 25% bonus cover automatically to your benefit amount there as well, right?
[10 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Wow.
[10 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And then that's at the age of 85, if he wishes to continue cover with us or you wish to continue cover with us for him. And then on the other end of the thing also anytime after his 85th birthday, there's an early cash out option where you can choose to end your cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit there as well. Yeah. So that would also be there for your uncle as well. Yeah, that's just to get your thoughts on that so far. How is the fortnightly premium of $39.88 standing there for 15,000?
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that is true. Yeah, 'cause it is. It does. It all comes down to his AJ.
[11 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. So he's, yes, 59 years old. So I was a little bit older than you, like a bit older than you guys. So it would, it would make a difference him being older. So the age is one of the factors that we do take into it. I could potentially be the only factor that we take into it when it comes to funeral insurance, which I can confirm.
[11 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Do you think if by any chance, so like, 'cause I'm just, do you think by any chance I can speak to my uncle and umm, and address him with this? Like, you know, just advise him so that he's more umm, so that he knows like, you know, umm like that, like should I just lay these choices out to him like these options?
[12 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yep, of course. Of course you can. Can't definitely do that there for you as well. Now just to confirm. Sorry, what O what option? Yep.
[12 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : And then do you think it's possible if I can call you back to do you do you, do you, do you have a do you have a direct dial? Like a direct dial.
[12 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : No, UN, unfortunately not, not me, who like we don't have a direct number that would come straight to me. What what we can do is I can send a call back on my system as well. But just to confirm as well, you said you wanted to lay out the options for your uncle. What options were you laying out? Like infinite amounts? Yeah.
[12 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, like I was looking at the 30,000 because I was hoping, you know, because I'm sure that when I lay out this option to him, I think he would consider this one. Umm, but like in terms because I know that, you know, it's just, it all comes down to financial side of things, you know, and I want to have a look at like a weekly budget and stuff like that. So I want to address this with my uncle first before I can make any decisions. So I want to. So I've already got what I need right now. You know, you've already given me the options.
[13 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : And for me, the 15,000 sounds really umm, promising for me, OK, umm, because like you said initially when he turned 85 years old, you know, that's 25%. It definitely allays like, you know.
[13 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[13 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna speak to him, but I know he will agree with the 30,000. Umm, And he said he will be happy to pay the 79. Umm, no, no, yes, yes.
[13 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, so just to confirm as well, would he be the one paying for it or would you be the one you would be the one out of like with your like account or your card or anything like you have your name on it.
[13 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Out of out of my own account.
[13 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, OK, OK. And then, but then you'd want to talk to him as to see which level of cover he wants to choose.
[13 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Out of Yeah.
[14 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : True.
[14 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Because I want to give him a send off of his lifetime, you know, does that make sense?
[14 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, no COM completely understandable.
[14 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Because I want to, even if the money is not the case here, it's what he wants. So I want to give him that option.
[14 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK.
[14 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Do you get what I mean?
[14 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : You are completely understandable. Now just in terms of that as well, I do wanna let you know that you can decrease your cover at any time subject to the eligibility, but you cannot increase your cover.
[14 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : So that's what I mean. Yeah, That's what I mean. Yeah.
[14 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so, so, yeah. So if you were to choose the 30,000, then you can decrease it.
[14 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : You won't give the country. OK. OK.
[14 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : But if you were to choose the 15,000 and if you wanted to increase it, you would have to get an additional pop up cover on top and then that will be calculated again at the age of commencement.
[14 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : So who?
[14 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So it'll be calculated again.
[14 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : I think so. So how about this, since you have given me the option, can we go for 30,000?
[14 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Of course. Of course it could.
[14 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : OK, let's go for 30,000.
[14 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[14 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : And that's like now let's sign up for 30,000 and I'll speak to my uncle and if he thinks, you know, 20,000 is more appropriate, then I'll call you back.
[15 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Of course.
[15 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Do you think that'd be great?
[15 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : And so of course, of course. So at any time, if you feel like you want to decrease the cover, no stress at all, you won't you call our support team. So who got, who called the first time? So they handle it after you guys have signed on. So then you'll give them a call, let them know your policy number or your the name and all that.
[15 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Sure, sure, sure.
[15 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : They'll confirm all the IDs and then just let them know that I want to apply to have my cover decreased. And then they can definitely help you out with that. Yeah.
[15 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Fantastic. Fantastic.
[15 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So what we will do in that case is if that's the option you're looking to take, we'll go ahead with the 30,000. So which is the Max. And then after you have a chat with your uncle, see what he wants and you can kind of move it down just to suit him as well or leave it at the 30,000 if he's happy with that as well.
[15 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Sure, sure, sure.
[15 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Alrighty, beautiful. So I'll grab a I do need a confirmation from you just before we go ahead, but as a third party payer purchaser, can I please confirm you are authorized to purchase this policy on behalf of the insured? Yes.
