So to give you a final quote, I do actually have to take you through a series of health and lifestyle questions because that does determine the final premium and terms of the policy. Umm, I'll, I'll take you through a bit of an indicative quote before we go through those questions, but just before we go through that later, just so I can have a better understanding of what sort of sparked interest. Are you new to life insurance? Are you new to life? Are you new to life insurance or do you have something in place at the moment?

[2 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, not fair enough. I'm sorry. If you've been thinking about it for a while now, let's talk to the sudden interest. You inquire now.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Because I've just checked so I didn't know I had to go until I need the explanation of why I was doing it.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, all good. I was just asking so I could have a better understanding. All good. Lena. I'll quickly run you through some main features and benefits of our cover. Then I'll take you through pricing. If you have any questions for me along the way, just stop me and let me know, OK? Alright, so our life insurance, it's designed to provide financial protection for your family, do a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. Uh, this benefit could be used to help maintain their lifestyle by helping them pay off, uh, mortgages, loans, bills, uh, basically any costs involved in raising a family. Basically, it's just there to give you that Peace of Mind that if something happened to you, your family has that financial security. Now, you know, you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this amount and they can also request an advance payout of $10,000. And that's to help with funeral costs, but also any other final expenses at the time as well, like unpaid bills, for example. So we're not going to dictate how they'd spend that money. And there is also a terminally ill advanced payout included in the cover as well.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : So what was it? Sorry.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Now there is also a terminally ill advanced payer included in the cover as well. So Lena, would you keep that nice and simple for you? Everything is done over the phone. There's no forms to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete. Again, I just have to take you through a series of health and lifestyle questions and determine the final pricing and terms of the policy. So before we go through those questions to get that final pricing to yourself, we'll go through a bit of a indicative quote first.

[14 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, no, all good. All good then. Alrighty, sorry, one second. My system's just processing on me. All right, Lena, well, I've got some good news for yourself. You have been approved for cover, but it is subject to the following terms and conditions. We are able to offer you a benefit amount of $50,000 to $100,000 with a policy term of 20 years. Now just to give you an indication, the $400,000 of life cover, that's a premium of $62.09 per fortnight. Now with this cover for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death. Only after 12 months you'll be covered for death due to any cause. However, suicide is not covered in the 1st 13 months of the policy and there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover as well. So after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, Lena would also pay your cover in full to help with medical costs and things like that as well. Now, your beneficiaries that will still be able to request a funeral advance payout of $10,000 to help with those immediate final costs like funeral expenses, unpaid bills, things like that. Now, Lena, just please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 2% with associated increases in premium. But you can opt out of this indexation each year as well. So Lena, the newcomer we've got for yourself, that was $100,000 of cover for a premium of $62.09 per fortnight. And in terms of coverage and affordability, how is this new cover sounding for yourself?
[16 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : So, so how much did you say this would be for?
[16 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : For $100,000 of cover.
[16 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : And when you say after 12 months I'd be entitled to increase it by 2%, what does that then go up to?
[17 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So that's your automatic indexation. So you your benefit amount will increase by 2% with associated increases of medium. You can opt out of that as well. So after that 12 month period, it would go up to $102,000. Yeah. And then from there, year on year, it will increase by 2%. Yep. So it's let me just get it back $62.00 and cents per 4th. So in terms of coverage and affordability there, Lena, how is that sounding?
[17 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : 102,000 and you said that that's $62.00 a Yep, I'm still as you can appreciate, I'm still shopping around policy. So yeah, that that would be affordable, right.
[18 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Good.
[18 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Wasn't aware that 100,000 words, there's gonna be the limit on it and then sort of stuff.
[18 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. No, that's understandable there. So the coverage amount, was that still sounding like a suitable amount for yourself?
[18 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Well, I thought IW, yeah, I sort of thought that you could actually ask for it and then it'd be assessed based on saying, I didn't realise that it was something that you guys would dictate what that looked like in terms of coverage.
[18 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, that's understandable. But Lena, if so, if the coverage and affordability were still sounding pretty good to yourself, what's holding you back at the moment?
[18 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Well, because I'm still flipping around, mate.
[18 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, no, that's understandable.
[18 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. I mean, it's like, it's like a car, right? You go to a car, yet you go to one car, yet you might, you know? So yeah, I'm actually looking around. So it's not a, to me. There's a question there. It's almost like, yeah. Yep.
[18 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Well, OK, well, you know what I'll do for now is I'll send you through a quote to your e-mail. I do have another option as well if you are liking the sound of our cover. Another option is to set up the policy with cover commencing today. That way what I can actually do for you is send you out all of your tailored policy documents to your e-mail. So you can kind of go through the policy in a bit more detail, see if everything is the way you want it to be. Now, if you find something you don't like, there's no locking contracts. You just call us back and I'll have it canceled. Now, Lena, to get that organized for you, I would need to collect payment details, but no money gets taken from you today. You can select a date that's suited for yourself to give you that time to make that decision. But this way you have access to those tailored policy documents and you're actually covered while you're making your decision. Does that sound like a suitable option for yourself?
[20 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : No, I appreciate, I do apologise, appreciate your offer.
[20 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Now that's understandable.
[20 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : However, on this on this occasion, I will be so as you can appreciate something around to to see what I yeah.
