Australia, was that right, Joe?

[41 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[41 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So I asked you the question of do you need to jointly authorise debit? And you did say yes. So saying yes, that question means you need someone to sign off with you to authorise a debit. Is that right or, or do you do it yourself?
[41 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Get myself there.
[41 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Oh, you do it yourself?
