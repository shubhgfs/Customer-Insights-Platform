[3 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : You see us?
[3 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : No problem at all. And I did just want to mention please now all our calls are recorded.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Any advice I provide is limited to the products we offer and this is need to make a decision about whether they are suitable for your needs. We do not consider your personal circumstances and this way. Does he currently have some funeral insurance in place or is this something new to him?
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : This will be something new to him.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : No problem. Well I'm just going to explain in regards to the cover there for him. So for the 1st 12 months it does say intersection U, but we're going to be referring to Rainsley he's. So for the 1st 12 months you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Only after the first 12 months you'll be covered for death due to any cause.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less delivered by a medical practitioner, that's when we paid the benefit amount to in full.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Bye. Yes.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : And for the cover, you can choose between $3000 up to $30,000. What amount would you like me to look at first for him?
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Thank you. OK, 55, I'll say something similar to mine, but a bit cheaper.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : That's right.
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Except I asked my daughter because she, her father won't be able to, you know?
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : No, I can understand. What I'll do is I'll pull up some amounts and then we can go through all different levels of cover. I'm just going to be a moment here just to create that profile. Perfect. So what I'll do is I'm going to start it at the bottom, which would be 3000, and then we can work our way up from there. Does that sound suitable?
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep Yep, that's it though.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : No problem. Wait or or did you have an amount in mind that you might want to stick in between?
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : How much is A10 do? Is $13 one a week?
[5 minutes][Agent] : So I can see what amount a week? So fortnightly I can see what amount would be that for a fortnightly because just without payment frequencies it is 4 nightly. With that the closest to the closest to $10 a week is going to be it's either going to be over $10 a week or under. So for $6000 of cover it comes to $18.25 a fortnight, which I'm just going to bring a calculator so I can work that out weekly.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, it's just loading up 1824. So for the amount of $6000 of cover for him it would be $9 and 12.5 cents a week. And then for $7000 weekly it would then bring it to so just be a moment loading that one on 1/29. So for the $7000 weekly, it would then be $10 and 64 point $0.05.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So for 7000 it's a bit more than $10 a week and then for 6000 it's a bit under $10 a week. Yep.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Well if I was to go sorry, for $20 a week, how much would the 14?
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So for $20 no problem at all. So. The closest one to that would be $13,000. That cover comes in at $39.54 a fortnight, which that would work out to be. I'm going to work out that weekly 54 / 2, that one works out to be $19.77 a week.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. I can do that. That one.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : No, no POM at all with that covered there. Your premiums are level, which means they are designed to stay consistent year on year.
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : And as well, when you reach the age of 85, the first thing that will happen is your premiums will seek which means you stop paying premiums.

[8 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Lovely. And then as well, in regards to setting this one up today you're, you've got that 30 day, sorry, 30 day calling off. So that's if you decide this policy is not suitable for you and cancel within the 30 days, then you'll receive a full refund of your premium unless a claim has been made. As well in regards to the premiums, you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount.
[8 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back unless you are relatable for and choose the early cash back offer. And Maria, just in regards to send this one up today, you're not required to make any upfront payments. I can select the day that's most suitable for you for that first payment.
