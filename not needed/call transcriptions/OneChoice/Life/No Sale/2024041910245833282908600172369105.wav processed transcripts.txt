[25 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, as long as the payments are kept up to date from a New Zealand bank account, correct. So we have to have the payments come out of a New Zealand bank account or they can come out from an overseas credit card. How is that? The payment will be with the New Zealand dollars, OK OK. So you as long as the payments are kept up to date, we will cover you worldwide. So if anything was to happen to you overseas, you know, I'd love for that to, you know, nothing horrible them being you know, for a holiday or something and something horrible happens to you. But if something was true and you would be covered, OK. And I know you said about, you know, using that money to bring your body home. So that's funeral advance that we've discussed. They can even use the funeral advance for that.
[26 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[26 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. OK, now we also include with our cover what's called a similarly ill advanced payment. So how that similarly ill advanced payment works is if you're unfortunately diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by medical practitioner, we're going to pay your claim out to you in full. Now we pay this out to you whilst you're still living and you'd be able to use that on whatever you needed to, whether you had any treatment costs, whether you wanted to spend extra time with loved ones, picking up a bucket list, you know the choice. It isn't rally up to yourself on what you choose to spend that money on. OK, perfect. Now with this one here, I do need to let you know that please be aware that your premium is set.
[27 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : None.
[27 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So what that means is that we'll generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has an automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. And you can opt out of this indexation each year. So each year around your policy anniversary, we'd actually send you out the letter saying this is what your new sum insured is going to be, what's associated increases in premium, and of course, you cannot doubt it, that one each year there.
[27 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[27 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So what I'm actually able to do for yourself today is I'm actually able to get yourself immediately covered over the phone today on that $300,000 policy without any sort of upfront payments or upfront costs. What we actually do is we note down a payment day and a payment method that is suitable for yourself in the near future. Now in saying that, this policy here, it does actually provide you with what's called a 30 day cooling off. So during that time, we're going to send you out all your personalized policy documents for you to review. You're actually going to receive 2 copies. So you'll receive an e-mail copy that'll be today, generally within the next hour, and then you'll receive a personal copy within the next 5 to 10 business days. Now should you then decide to cancel within those 30 days, you'll actually receive a full refund of any premiums you may have paid, of course, unless the claim has been made. So I worked that one there. Of course we don't take any payments off you today. However, as a business we do generally collect payment within the next 7 days. When in the next 7 days would be more suitable for you?
[29 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I want help cancel the policy or no? She said that I should not cancel the policy until I start with them.
[29 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So what we, what we do is we recommend that you do not cancel your, if you are replacing an existing policy, we recommend that you do not cancel it until you review this policy in full as it may not be identical to your existing cover there. But in terms of that one there you just tried that the you just don't want the payments to come out at the same time as your current cover. Is that what? Is that what you're worried about?
[29 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, can, can, can you call back tomorrow so that I can work things out with this policy?
[29 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : I'm I'm actually not in tomorrow. I'm on annual leave. Do you mind me asking why you're not wanting to get this one set up today?
[29 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : And oh, the reason is because I I want to talk to my insurance, another insurance provider.
[30 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yes Sir. Do you mind me asking was about simulation to because I want to, I want to know like what are the in there which covered which I covered with for that particular policy? Mm hmm. So is that in terms of your current cover, you just want to have a chance to sit down and compare it with your current cover.
[30 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : It just because, because I want to, I want to know like what are the benefits in there, which is covered, which is which I'm covered with for that particular policy, yeah.
[30 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Look, I, I understand that one there. You know, I can send you through bit of basic information and pricing, but it would be just that what I actually also am able to do for you is so that you can sit down and compare the two policies side by side is get this one set up for you today without any upfront payments or upfront costs. That way they're unable to send you out all your personalized policy documents. You're actually receive an e-mail copy of that one there today. That way there you can sit down, compare the two policies side by side. Now this policy has no locking contracts or no cancellation fees. So even if you decide to afterwards that you would like to cancel this cover, all you'd need to do is give us a call and apply to cancel the policy. It is a very simple process. Of course, you, you all you need to do is call our customer care department for that. That one there. So in terms of that one there, is there a day that you'd like the first payment to come out on? Yeah. Look, you just let me know what day you'd like the first payment to come out, and I'll let you know if I can select that payment date.
[31 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : And it'll be after two weeks, so so apart from this Tuesday, next Tuesday, the 3rd Tuesday, what will be the third Tuesday?
[31 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So not, not next Tuesday the 31st, but the following Tuesday the 7th, Yeah, absolutely. I can make that first payment of $13.42 come out on Tuesday the 7th and then it would be every second Tuesday thereafter.
[31 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[32 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So what we're doing now is we note down that payment method. So we do this very securely over the phone by one of two simple options. So the first is either by a Visa Debit, Visa MasterCard or credit card, or the second is my bank account number for a direct debit. What one's more suitable for you? Perfect. The name on the bank account? Is it just under your first and last name? Is that spelled VIKASHNI?
