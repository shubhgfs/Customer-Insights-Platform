[8 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Now, the commencement of your cover will be subject to the finalists assessment by the insurer. If there's no changes to that premium or to your life insurance, what I'll be able to do is then accept the policy on your behalf if you're happy with that premium there and there's no changes. And then at that point I'll then be able to send you out your personalized policy documents to your e-mail and then they'll be posted out to you. OK, so does that sound like it can work for you?
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yes, thank you.

[10 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep, one SEC. So you say within the next 7 days.
