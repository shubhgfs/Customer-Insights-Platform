[1 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Just a lot of family members that have passed away this year.
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's both. Just there's been some situations where they didn't opt for life insurance. And on many occasions, you know, I just think that how hard it is for family to worry about finances. And I just don't want to have to put that stress on my family window time, you know, if if anything happened to me.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, well, I'm very sorry to hear about a lot of family members passing away this year.
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : That's very, umm, hard to hear when you say a lot. There's been a few by the sounds of it. OK. Yeah.

There's a lot of people at our age that that unfortunately don't end up having that kind of relationship with an ex partner and and Co parenting like in being able to just do it where it's civilized and and peaceful, right.

[2 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that's good. Just a lot of respect now. Yeah. OK. Well, you've got some great reasons to be looking into life insurance covering. Yeah. It is designed to be able to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. So with the benefit amount that you choose, it could be used to help house any loans or debts that you may have or any costumes.
[3 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, can you say that again?
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So that's OK. So with the life insurance, it is designed to be able to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. So you get to choose a benefit amount to be insured for and that amount that you choose when you pass away.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : I just don't understand what you think.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : It could be used to help health any debts that you may have, even if that's like a credit card debt, or it could be used for any costs involved you raising my son like it may help pay for his education costs or his living expenses if something happened to you.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So basically with the life insurance, it is there to be able to provide you with the Peace of Mind that if something could happen to you, that your family have then got that financial security. And like you mentioned, you do want to be able to leave that same, you know, financial hardship on your family that you've seen occur.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah. Just a question. Do you guys control how the money is spent?
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : No, not at all. So what we do for you is we pay the benefit about your beneficiaries. You get to nominate between one to five people to receive the money.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : O OK Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : And when that time does come, they will contact us and speak to our claims department, OK?
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : And umm, they'll go through what the beneficiary needs to provide in order to be able to process the claim and they can spend that money however they would like to.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, cool. Yeah.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, now your beneficiaries are also able to request an advance payout of $10,000 to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses that you may have. So as you know, it can be quite hard on the family to be able to come up with a lump sum to pay for a funeral, especially if that is that in. But you do have peace in mind that with our policy they can request that advance payout and that she only pay to your loved ones within 24 to 48 hours of receiving the relevant documentation. Also including our policy for you is a terminally or advanced payment. So if you were diagnosed to be 12 months or less less by a medical practitioner, we would then pay your claim in full and that money could be used to your own medical costs or treatment. It is up to you how you would like to use it. So this component of the policy is designed to protect you while you're still alive.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Does that make sense?
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yes.

And you're welcome to choose a benefit amount from $100,000 up to $1 million. What amount would you like me to quote you on?

Pain, menstrual pain, those sorts of things, but not a miss. Sorry. What I'll do then is I'll just get some information relation to that. I'll ask a couple of questions for you.

[43 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : I never done any tests. Yeah, I've, I just had the consultation. They did like they did give me the, they did refer me to get some tests done because I asked for it, but I just never went. And so that was the end of that. Yeah, but that was because they told me that I was fine. But I I just wanted to be sure that I was fine.
[43 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So consultation with doctor, OK, so once the doctor referred her to get further tests done, but she never went and umm, her OK, so for the test, and I'll just put here because she insisted, umm, because she insisted after the, the doctor advised that she was fine, uh, she never went to have further testing done and menstrual cycle returned to normal. And how long has it been normal for? Roughly how many months? OK.
[44 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, I would say like nine months, yeah.
[45 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : And has been regular for approximately the last the last nine months at the time the doctor advise actually I'll put in the next question so quick. Thank you. Is any further investigational treatment plan? If so, when so? No, but the doctor advised at the consultation that weight loss would assist with that. Is that right?
[45 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah, yeah. So I was referred to, I was referred to a specialist. I don't know what is called. I think he he specializes in like a female hormones. I'm not too sure there's a flash name for it. I went to see him and then from him I was advised that regular exercise and changing my eating habits will bring my body back.
[46 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : I say you did go to a specialist, OK?
[46 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it refers me to somebody, but this was I, I think this was more than three years ago when they did that.
[46 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[46 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Because it's the.
[46 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : I'll put that in the previous question. Previously, she has seen a specialist who advised that exercise, exercise and weight loss would assist with regular. Regular menstrual cycle.
[47 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's yeah.
[47 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, thank you. OK, right. And just with that question, I've just put the that you saw the specialist because that's part of I guess you know consultations and things like that. The next question is any further investigation or treatment plan, If so, when I just let he know, is that correct? OK. And please advise before recovery has been made.
[47 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yes.
[47 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Was there anything else that I need to put down for you in the last three years, Rowenia?
[47 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No.
[47 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK. And in relation to a discussion that we were having about being a little bit unsure about the health and master questions and disclosing things, how are you feeling now? Do you feel like I need to go back to any further? Any other questions? Are you confident now that you provided me with everything you need to provide?
[48 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I'm I'm confident.
[48 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, It was just that was it about the menstrual cycle. OK, that's all good. Thank you for letting me know that.
[48 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's alright.
[48 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So just in relation to providing that information to me, there is a little bit of a different outcome. Umm, so because missing the, the pre like the the menstrual cycle, that was not my list. We now need to refer the application to the insurer. OK, sorry, just to let you know with that answer you provide, the application is preferred to the underwriter for assessment. OK. So you should prove this policy will cover you for deaths due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. As I mentioned to you before as well, there is a terminate or advance payment included for you. So if you're diagnosed with 12 months or less today by a medical practitioner, we would then pay the benefit of it in full.
[49 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Right. But you just so just because of the me notifying you of the missed periods like you, it's not being approved today.
[49 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : And I have already let you know about the price change as well now in relation to it may actually come back today. OK. So what actually happens is, is because what you disclosed to me about like going to see the doctor about miss periods, it's not actually on the list. We have like a drop down list. It wasn't there. So it just means that we then needed to get some information from you about it and just explain the consultation that everything's normal with those results as well. And then what happens now is that I'm going to send off the application to ensure and I'll have a look over it and I'll be back to us within generally within 24 to 40 hours of an outcome. OK.
[49 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : None.
[49 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So while your application is being assessed, you, you will be covered for accidental death which pays that adjusts you to a direct result of an accident cover under this last until the insurer makes the decision on the application on 30 days from today, whichever is earlier. So Rowena, the commencement of your cover will be subject to final assessment by the insurer. OK. So if if the insurer approves your cover without any changes, are you happy to record your acceptance of this policy now? And then I'll send out all your policy information to e-mail and postal address.
[50 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[50 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's fine. So I have already collected your banking details from you. OK, So that all remains the same and the e-mail address is iniara.w@gmail.com. I've got the payment date for Wednesday which is awkward as well.
[50 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Is that for the 11th?
[50 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, now with the declaration that, sorry, yes, it's for the 11th next Wednesday.
[51 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[51 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I read out the declaration to you, umm, and I've just got to confirm with you the last couple of questions in that declaration. And then what I'll do is I'll send off your application and I'll have an answer back for you. If there's no changes then I will, I'm going to call you anyway. But if there's no changes to what we've discussed, I'll put the policy in place and have everything set. If there are any changes, I will wait till I speak to you to let you know what they are. OK.
[51 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Cool.
