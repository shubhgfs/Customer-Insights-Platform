[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's all right. Well, what our life insurance is designed to do is to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you go to pass away. And this benefit could be used to help maintain their lifestyle by helping them pay off a mortgage, loans, and any other costs involved in raising a family.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So basically it's there to give you the Peace of Mind that if something happened to you, your family would have that financial security.

[3 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Uh, you, you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this benefit amount. And what they can do at the time of claim is request an advanced payout of $10,000 to help with any funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time.

[4 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, right. OK, so primarily the mortgage. OK, well, look, we do keep everything nice and simple for you. So everything's all done over the phone. Uh, there's no forms to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete. Uh, we simply have a series of health and lifestyle questions that we take you through over the phone and this will determine the pricing and terms of the policy for you as well. Uh, just a couple questions. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, what?
