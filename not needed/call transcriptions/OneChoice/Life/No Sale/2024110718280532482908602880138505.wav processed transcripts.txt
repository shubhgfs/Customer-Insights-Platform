And also in addition, there is a living benefit. So there is a terminally ill advanced payment. And while this is something that we hope is never actually needed, it does mean that if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we're actually able to pay that claim to you in full while you are still living.

OK, Now don't forget it allows your wife to request the events payout of $10,000 to help with the fuel expenses as well. OK. Now please be aware that your premium is skipped, which means that we generally increase each year.

We'll set up the date in the future and the policy gives you a 30 day free look. So that if you decide the policy is not suitable for you and choose to cancel within 30 days, you'll receive a full refund if your premium on the claim has been made. That way it gives you a chance to sit down with both policy documents, read them side by side and make sure you're happy with ours.
