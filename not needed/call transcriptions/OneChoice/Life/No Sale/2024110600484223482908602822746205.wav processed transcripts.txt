[19 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, All right, OK. And so, and with that one though, so I even though I know you're not sure and there's no payments going out or anything like that. So there's nothing to say that you are still paying for it and that's still in place.
[19 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[19 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : And would it have been more, if so, would it have been more than $5 million?
[19 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : I would say so because I've been there for 10 years. I think it might be. Yeah. I'm not sure.
[19 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, so all right, all right. So when you took out a policy in Australia, would you have taken it out for a total sum insured of more than five?

[20 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : I see.
[20 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[20 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, so you pay for something out through your job when you were working in that job and and would it have been like when you were paying for more than $5,000,000 though?
[20 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : I think it would have been more, yeah, more than 5 million, but I'm not sure what's happened to it. I haven't gone back to follow up on it.
[20 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK OK. So to the best of your knowledge though, is it just a void now or what? What is the situation? You haven't been paying for it or anything because you left that job.
[20 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I'm not SH. Yeah, I haven't gone back to have a look into it, but I would say so. It's been voided.
[20 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK.

[21 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK. All right. OK. And I'm so in saying that then, do you. So obviously, you know, if you you have to be the one that answers this, would you say that it's no longer in place then?
[21 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I would say so. It's been so long.

[53 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : And Oh my gosh, good on you size. I read. That's amazing. Oh well, I'm always at all. And OK, So what it's really saying is that other than the one off event. So when you're considering doing it, do you have it and do you have a full intention to do it or engage in it or you just sort of it's in your mind If you're not really going to, you don't know.
[54 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Umm, it's in my mind. But yeah, I am considering doing it in the next probably 12 months or so.
[54 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, all right. And is it going to be umm, what did you say it was going to be? Umm, umm, what was it going to be?
[54 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Skydiving.
[54 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : You're going to do skydiving. OK, let's have a look for you here. So is it going to be just a one off that you wanted to do?
[54 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. One off.
[54 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK, All right, so the questions got a couple of things in it and it really just starts up other than one off events. OK, so gift certificate or voucher, do you engage in like right now or intend to engage in? So you haven't booked anything, but you're thinking about doing the skydiving, but you think about doing just a one off, is that correct?
[55 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : That's correct, yes.
[55 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, all right. But you haven't booked anything in yet at all. It's just something that's in your mind.
[55 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : No, that's correct. Yes.
[55 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : All right, I'll have a look at that for you. Hang on a second. I'm going to put a no there because it's going to be just a one off and you haven't exactly got it booked yet. You might think about it in the future. So I'm going to put a no, but that's totally fine. Yeah, I just admire your bravery, that's for sure. OK, so put a no there now. I'm going to submit this. I'm going to let you know what we're going to do next. So thank you so much for your patience.
[55 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : That's OK.
[55 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Now in reference to your health and lifestyle answers, your application needs to be referred to the underwriter for assessment. And this is because of your and our deficiency anemia. I put it in the second set a different section because and it's not always controlled by your medication and diet at the same time, it can be the various. So I want to capture all that information so that I can send it off. So what happens now is, is that so I sent that off with all, I sent it off with all the information. I've got lots of notes in there. A normal procedure to put plenty notes in there and now they'll come back If it's approved the policy, it'll cover you for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[56 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[56 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, now there's a terminally ill advanced payment. It's already included in this cover for you. So if you sadly were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay you out your whole claim in full. So get the whole amount of money in full Now. Please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year.
[56 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[56 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means so each year your benefit amounts it will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. And you can opt out of this indexation each year if you want to. So you can have full control of whether you want that to grow your amount that you're insured for. You don't want it to grow. There might be sometimes in your life where you think you might have a bit more debt and you might want to keep it growing or you might want to, you know, think of getting a mortgage, whatever it is my circumstance, but you may not either. So that's why we give you full control whether or not you want to, umm, have the indexation on there or not each year. Does that make sense?
[57 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[57 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because you've got full control there.
[57 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK.
[57 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Now what I can do for you is I can do so we're looking at a 1.5 million, we're looking at a fortnightly premium of $240.87 for nightly. Now what I can do like a pre set up for you where I collect your payment details or read you your declaration, I can go ahead and get it assessed by the underwriter for you. You're happy with that? Perfect. Now what happens now is while your application is being assessed, you will be covered for accidental death.
[57 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, OK.
[58 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So you're going to have that now, OK, which pays out if death was due to a direct result of an accident. Now cover for this last until the insurer makes a decision on your application or 30 days from today, whichever is earlier. Now the commencement of your cover will be subject to final assessment by the insurer. Now, if the insurer approves cover without any changes, are you happy for me to record your acceptance of this policy now? And I'll just send you out your policy documents, your information to your e-mail and your postal address. You're happy with that?
[58 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[58 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Let's pick a day when you want the first collection date to come out on. So today is 30th of April. What day do you want the first payment to be? You can have a choice of that, of course.
[58 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK, Sir, I want to choose a day that it comes out. It will be Thursday every Thursday. Is that alright?

[59 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Every fortnight Thursday, next week Thursday.
[59 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yes, of course. So not this Thursday. The next one is going to be the 9th. We'll have the first payment coming out on the ninth of the every two weeks after that on the Thursday. Perfect.
