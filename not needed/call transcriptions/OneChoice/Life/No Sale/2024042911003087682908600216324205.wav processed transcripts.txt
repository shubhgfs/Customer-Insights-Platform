Hey, Stuart, thanks for holding. Sorry about that. So I'm all done now with the with the questions. I'm just pulling up the results. I just realized I can see some when we last did the application, it looks like we had, let's have a look here locked in your height as 186 centimeters. Now you mentioned to me that it was 183. I know that both times you gave me confident answers. So Stuart, were you in between 183 and 186 centimeters? OK. Well, if that's the case, we do put down the shorter weight, which is 183 centimeters. So we'll leave that as so. And just to confirm, last time you mentioned you were 91 KGS, now it's 91.5. So you're in between the two of those as well, Stuart.
[21 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Morris Yes, yes.
[21 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, in that case, we put the the high level, which is 91.5. So that that's fine. We can leave that as as we captured it already. So let's have a look here. So it's the same as last time. Should I'll just let you know that in reference to your health and lifestyle answers, your application does need to be referred to the underwriting team. Now I know we've already done this process, but because it has expired, it does need to go back upstairs. So I'll send it back up to them. Now. Let me have a look here. So let's get it up here, yes. So in reference to the health and lifestyle answers, the application must need to be referred to the underwriting team for assessment. Now, if it is approved, the policy will cover you for death due to any cause except suicide. In the 1st 13 months. There is a terminally ill advanced payment. If you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, we will pay out your claim in full. Please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year. In addition, the policy has an automatic indexation, which means each year you'll benefit amount. So what you're covered for that will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. You can opt out of that indexation each year, but what we'll do now is do it now that we have the banking details, we can note it down with those. So what we'll do is we'll note down your preferred method of payment. I'll read you the declaration. We'll we'll get this assessed by the underwriting team. Now you can choose the payment that you'd prefer. So just to confirm, as a business, we generally collect the payment within the next 7 days, when in the next 7 days would be more suitable for you? So at what date would you like to make the first payment there? OK. And that's going to be fortnightly or would you prefer that monthly?
[23 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : 10th of November, fortnightly.
[23 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem. So it'll be fortnightly, $106.43. Umm, the first time will be the 10th of November. Now I'll just let you know again as well. While the application is being assessed, you will be covered for accidental death, which pays out if death was due to a direct result of an accident. Cover under this loss until the insurer makes a decision on your application or 30 days from today, whichever is earlier, usually just takes a few hours. So it shouldn't take much time there at all. Now we will note down that preferred method of payment this time, Stuart. So we can use either a Visa MasterCard or we can use an account number. How do you want to note that down? OK.
[23 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Account number No.
[23 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Is that going to be under the name Stuart Chapman SG?
[24 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : It's SG and Lane Yes and lane.

[24 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes 06 0465 002676100.
[24 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem. Now I just have to ask you these two questions about the account you've given me. The first one does read Stuart. So the account you've just given me, I might have already asked this, but just have to confirm it here. Do you have authority to operate this bank account alone and do not need to jointly authorize debits? Is that correct?
[25 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[25 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll confirm too. Have you cancelled a direct debit authority for one choice, which is this company with PN Equal Life is the initiator in the last nine months And I'll confirm because we're organizing this over the phone. Are you happy to set up a direct debit authority without signing a form?
[25 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : No, yes.
[25 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. I'll just confirm as well. Stuart, you agreed this authority is subject to the terms and conditions relating to the bank account provided, which is your bank account, and the specific direct debit terms and conditions that relate to this authority. So Stuart, you authorize your bank to allow Pinnacle Life, who is the initiator for One Choices company, to direct debit this account, which is your account, in accordance with these terms and conditions. You agree to that there. OK, Stuart, I'm going to read out your declaration now. Just takes about two minutes. Then I'll get this referred to the underwriting team. Once I have the results, I'll give you a call, let you know the results. I know that last time it was approved, but it had been expired, so it does need to go back upstairs. So it shouldn't take too long to come back down. Now I know last time that I was trying to get back a hold of you and I couldn't. So we do have a, a, another option here as well. Stuart, if you give me authority to, are you happy to be to record your acceptance now and I can leave you a voicemail to let you know the outcome?
[25 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep, this one.
