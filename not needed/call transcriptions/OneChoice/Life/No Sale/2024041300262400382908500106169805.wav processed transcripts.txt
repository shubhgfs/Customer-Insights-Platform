[14 seconds][Customer] : Hello, I'm mate doing speaking.
[24 seconds][Agent] : Hi, Magdeleine, How are you today?
[26 seconds][Customer] : I'm just thank you very well.
[29 seconds][Agent] : That's very good to hear you. I'm just returning your phone call today regarding your cancel request. Before I do continue though, I would just like to let you know that the calls are recorded and umm, any advice I provide is submitted to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they are suitable for your needs. We do not consider your personal circumstances. And may I please confirm your full name and your date of birth? And just a e-mail address, please. Beautiful. And with your address, we also had lower Hut 5014. Is that correct?
[54 seconds][Customer] : Yes, 20th of April 1996 and 35 Brunswick Street, 18 Almaty and lenadominic_1@hotmail.com 5014, correct.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : And lower Hut and the number that I've just sent you and is the best contact number.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : I'm sorry, what was that?
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, the phone number that I've just reached you and is your best contact number, is that correct?
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, correct.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Lovely. And I can see here you've recently taken a $500,000 life insurance policy.
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : I can see here that you were considering cancelling. Can I ask what's changed since you took this policy out?
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : I have had a quote with with my bank and they provided a bit of quote for me which shouldable regarding the finance wise it was more affordable for me.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : I see. OK Lovely.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : That's with risk tech.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Can I ask you what bank that was through Westpac? Lovely. And was that before? So you went through your health and lifestyle questions?
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : That was before.
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : I see. OK. And was it before I asked if they took your speaking status may I ask?
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : That was before.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So umm, they gave you the quote prior to taking your smoking status and going through the health and lifestyle question.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : That's right.
[2 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK umm, good to see. Any reason I ask you? Because I can see here that why you were fully approved into the cover. You are currently paying smokers right? So you have the Peace of Mind of knowing that umm, you know, any umm, smoking related illness, uh, or terminal illness or death, umm, will be covered under the policy. But you do pay higher rates for that And umm, if you ever do give up and maintain it for 12 months, umm, the non-smoking that is. You can actually plan to have your smoking rates lifted or removed, which may, uh, reduce the policy for you. I can also just say there was a couple of loadings.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : There was a loading due to BMI and also a loading due to rheumatoid arthritis, which is also affecting your premium. Do you know once you go through the health and lifestyle questions with Westpac is a premium subject to change like ours did?
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Not really.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Because when we give our customers a quote like I can only speak with first about our product, it's prior to like underwriting. So what that means is like if I pull up a quote for someone your age before they went through the underwriting who was say a a non-smoker for instance, the benef is your current annual income 50,000 or more?
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : OK, right, sorry.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Is your current annual income 50,000 or more.
[4 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : What was that 50,000 on that? It's actually less than that.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Your current income, sorry, your current annual income, is it 50,000 or more not a problem.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So just to give you a quick example of what umm say a $500,000 quote would look like prior to the underwriting with us it's $16.34 for a 500,000 for a non-smoker. So someone similar to your age.
[5 minutes][Customer] : Right.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : However the reason your opinion is coming in at the 67 is because you pay as a smoker. And then there were those loadings due to those health related questions.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, mm. Hmm.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So it doesn't mean you're excluded from anything. It just means that you pay for those, umm, ex that extra risk, if that makes sense.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So I was just, yeah, wondering if, umm, what was that quote, umm, Westpac gave you prior to underwriting, if you don't mind me asking? Yeah.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : What was the quote for? Is that what you mean?
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : The price, yes, yeah.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : I'm currently paying $42.00 every fortnight.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Oh, have you already set your Westpac policy up? Have you?
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I have.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I see. OK. So you did you go through health and Microsoft questions or any medicals to get that one set up?
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yes, umm, I have a umm, I have a bad money to go through my doctor just to confirm my health issues.
[6 minutes][Agent] : Oh.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Umm umm, they were able to go a hypothetical and I just went from there.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : I see. OK. Umm, oh, so they sent you to the doctor and then, umm, based on the doctor, they put it in place. Are they still waiting for the doctor's report? They're still waiting for the doctor's report.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : That is why No, they've received it already.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I see. OK, that's making sense. I see. So they did that bit of a service screening with you umm and got some information of your doctor.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : That is right.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK lovely.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : And that is the same amount.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : And can I ask how much your benefit amount with restock use 500?
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : That's right.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK lovely. And is there any exclusions or age terminations in your W pet policy? Does it end when you reach a certain age at all?
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Umm, I'm not quite sure. I haven't umm, sorry, looked into it at my, but I believe it is.
[7 minutes][Agent] : You believe it does end when you reach a certain age?
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : I believe so, yeah.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : I see. OK, the reason I ask is because the policy you currently hold with us, it doesn't have any age termination, so it is renewable for life. Let's have a look here. And not only is it covering you for death due to any cause excluding suicide in the 1st 13 months. But the policy does also have a living benefit where it offers a terminal illness advance payment where if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, you can claim your full benefit as a living benefit.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, bye mm Hmm, bye bye.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : And you could actually use this money however you source it. So whether it were to help with medical costs, help supplement any lost income, you know, whatever you really need it for such a time.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Umm, And included in the last benefit is a $10,000 advance payment that your beneficiary can request, which could help with the cost associated for life. Uh, sorry. Which could help with the cost associated with the funeral. My apologies. Still early, isn't it, my Glenn? Umm, also umm, not only is it renewable for life, it is 24 hours a day, seven days a week, anywhere in the world cover. So you have the Peace of Mind of knowing that even if you do decide to travel, umm, or inside or outside of work or doing any sort of activities, you have the Peace of Mind of knowing umm that the policy doesn't exclude any, any of those types of things. Umm, would you like to, umm, check with Westpac if your policy does expire once you reach a certain age, or umm, if it has any exclusions built into it?
[8 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, yeah, shouldn't I? I could do that.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, not a problem. And would you like me to give you a follow up call maybe today or tomorrow?
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Umm, is it really an issue?
[9 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : I mean, it's certainly up to you, just if you wanted the opportunity just to really compare the two policies, double check, umm, see if there are any of those umm, exclusions in the Westpac policy or if it does expire once you reach a certain age. Umm another thing you can do with your policy because it actually does pay over and above anything else you do have in place just so you are aware.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK, no.
[9 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Umm So what?
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Bye.
[9 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : What that means is say for instance if you had umm 2 policies in place and you claimed your terminal illness benefit with us at any stage umm then you know you might have that other policy. Umm so the left F left behind for the family to claim upon.
[9 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : No.
[9 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Umm your benefit amount can start from $100,000 at $22.41 per fortnight. Umm, is that something you might feel would be beneficial as an additional top up cover for you?
[9 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK Is it?
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[10 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm still, I mean it's, I still got a lot to kind of umm, think about this umm, but umm, I'm actually still constantly happy to go with the best tech umm, but uh, life insurance, if that makes sense.
[10 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Umm, because I was just umm, simply just kind of compared it to umm. This tech was something that would be more suitable for me. So, umm in in saying that all I wanted to simply do is just to cancel the the run choice. There could be sometime in the future that I could always come back and change if it happens, if it comes down to that.
[10 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm mm hmm. Absolutely. I certainly hear where you're coming from and you are welcome to reapply. However, keep in mind there's no guarantee this isn't a guaranteed acceptance product.
[10 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : But I'm just going back the now situation of the vaccine, OK?
[10 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yes. The reason I was just letting you know all the different options there is as you have already been, as as you have already completed the health and lifestyle questions and have been fully approved for the cover.
[11 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Bye.
[11 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : If you were to cancel the policy now and reapply at a later stage, you may find that due to a change in your health and lifestyle, you may not be approved or you may have to pay high premiums due to lighting.
[11 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[11 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yes, yes. So you do have other options such as reducing the policy to a level of cover that you might solicitable as an additional top.
[11 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. What are your thoughts behind that? Of course, that's your decision. Yeah, not a problem at all. I will certainly help you with your cancel request as you are still receiving your calling off. I can help you with that over the phone.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Just still wanna go with the risks unfortunately, OK?
[11 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Getting that already. OK, so we are waiving the requirement for you to put your cancellation in writing and by agreeing to this declaration you acknowledge that your instruction to cancel the policy is immediate, final and non reversible. From agreement to this declaration. You will now want to have coverage under your one choice life insurance policy.
[12 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : I agree.
[12 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Can you please confirm that you've agreed this declaration and instruct me to cancel the policy that's all been cancelled out and you will receive a written confirmation within the next 7 business days letting you know it's all cancelled. Beautiful. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
[12 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK, That's all for me for today. Thank you.
[12 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : My pleasure, you have a lovely day.
[12 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[12 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Thank you.
[12 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : See you later.
[12 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Bye bye.
[12 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Bye.
