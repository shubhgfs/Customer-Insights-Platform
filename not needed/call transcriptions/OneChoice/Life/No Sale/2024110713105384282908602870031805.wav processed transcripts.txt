[21 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So basically now that the application has been approved, it means that the policy would cover you for this due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months that starts as soon as you accept the declaration. So essentially I can have you covered by this, uh, policy. By the end of this phone call, you would still have access to the terminally owed advanced payment and your beneficiaries would still have access to the advance payout of $10,000. Now, the premiums are stepped on the cover, which means it'll generally increase, uh, each year. And in addition, the policy has an automatic indexation increase, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 5%. That comes with an associated increase in the premiums. The good news is you can opt out of the automatic indexation increase each year. OK, now what does that mean for the price? I've got to double check on the something.

[23 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : And what did it end up being? Oh, OK. So it ended up being just the just swelling from something hitting your shoulder.
[23 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, I need to double check this because, umm, so that was back in 1999.
[23 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : It it, yes, Yeah. Back in 1999, yeah.

Now if you decide in the end that you're not happy with it or you change your mind, that's fine.
[27 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[27 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : It's not a lock in contract. So if you cancel it within the 30 days, you get a full refund of any payments you had made unless the claim has been made.
[27 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : OK, alright, OK.
[27 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK, now you'll get a copy to the e-mail address that I confirmed earlier within 15 minutes or possibly by tomorrow morning at the latest, and a copy via post within 5 to 10 working days. Can you confirm your home address for me?
