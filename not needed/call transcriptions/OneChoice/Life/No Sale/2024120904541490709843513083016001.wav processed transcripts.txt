[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that is correct.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful. And the phone number we're speaking on, is that still your best and only contact number we have on file?
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it sure is. Yes.
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK beautiful. OK, so just quick call here as the last payment for you. One Choice life insurance for the amount of $10 was unsuccessful last Thursday, 5th of December due to insufficient funds. We understand that these types of things can happen, so to assist you in keeping your policy in place, you'd like to confirm a few details with you today. I see.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Oh, sure.
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Umm, Mary, you have a direct debit set to come from your ANZ bank account. Last four digits of your account number are 49, suffix 00. Are these still the right payment details?
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yes, they still are. They still are the right ones as well.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, all right.
[1 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Good to know.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I'm sorry.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : And then another question, Mary, in regards to this outstanding payment from last Thursday there I can collect their once off payment today through our secure payment system which will bring your policy up to date right away simply by using any debit card or credit card.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : I'm so sorry. I don't have any funds today. I don't get paid for next week.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, no problem.
[2 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : However, you said to me that the you said to me that the funds was taken out on a Thursday. Is that right? Oh, that's straight.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yes, last Thursday being the 5th of December come from your direct debit from your bank account. We do attempt the debit across three to four business days. So on that first day on Thursday should have debited hourly between 2:00 AM and 4:00 PM and then it should have attempted again on Friday at 12:00 PM in the in midday. However, that one did not go through. But look, that's OK. What I can offer is that's OK. What date within the next 7 days would be suitable for us to collect the missed payment? We can try that one again from your account. OK.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I was hoping if you guys can just check it out all at once when my husband's account gets taken out like so, I'd also pay for my husband's one of 39 something or almost $10.00. But I was happy if you guys can just check it out the same time when you guys take my husband's one out.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Oh OK. So when do we take that one out? I can only see your policy in front of me. I've only got your 1 here.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : So my husband's policy, so you guys take that out every Tuesday's fortnight.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : So I'm hoping, I'm hoping if you guys can please take that out on next Tuesday.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we can do that. So you're happy for me to move, catch up on this arrears next Tuesday, 17th of December. And then moving forward, that will mean your next one that's due on the 19th being a Thursday.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yes, hello.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Do you want me to also move this to the 17th? Yep.
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : So I was hoping, I was hoping if everything can still be taken out next week on Tuesday.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll move your so that will just mean I have to move your collection date. So I'm moving it from the 19th to the 17th. So just bear in mind, Mary, premiums are calculated daily. So this will make your once off premium amount just a little bit lesser. So I'm moving it from 19 to 17. It will be just waiting for that to load up.
[4 minutes][Customer] : Yes, just take out $20 like you know.
[4 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yep, yes, that's what I'm going to do. Just let me have a look. Oh, OK. Because of the arrears I can't move the collection date. Just going to do 2 payments on the 17th anyway and I'll move your next one out. But so in January, I'll make sure everything's aligned for you. So 2 payments on the 17th, OK. And then I'll just work with every fortnight on a Tuesday after that.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, please.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that means your 2nd of January payment, I'm going to move it to the 31st of December.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that sounds good.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So that's when I guess your husband, this one would be due. Yep. OK. Just bear with me while I do this, while you're on the call. Oh OK, So what the system has allowed me to do, Mary, I can't do the two payments on 17th, it's only allowing me to do the one on the 17th because we have to catch up on the arrears before we can do anything. So that will just require a 2 payments on the 31st of December then? How does that sound? Right.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's fine. No problem.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, so your December payment will be $18.47, so a little bit lesser because I've bought that collection date forward from the second of Jan to the 31st of December. OK. And then it will follow every fortnight on a Tuesday for $10.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Excellent.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so that's all sorted.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : So what about next week? What about next week on Tuesday? Would that only be $10? Wonderful.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Mm Hmm, yes, correct $10 and then 1847 on the 31st, so you'll catch up by the 31st.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Wonderful. That's not a problem at all.
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. Well Mary, is there anything else I can assist with whilst on the call today? Awesome.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : No, I, I just have a question for you. Like let's just say for example, like something had happened to me. Will my, like would my beneficiaries be able to claim on my regards?
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yep, I actually Mary, good question.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Oh, what?
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I don't have a beneficiary applied to your policy at the moment. It looks like you haven't requested any beneficiary. So what I can do is I can have that form sent out to your address we have on file.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll have that sent. And all you have to do is just send that back to us. All right, All right. Done. Yep. Yep.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : And also I also wanted to ask you, so just to clarify on my policy because I haven't read it within like a year now and I've been with you guys for over a year.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : So just to my understanding, when I signed up, if I had passed on or if I had passed away, what my beneficiaries claim 300,000, was that correct? Yes.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : The the benefit amount that you're claimed that you're covered for, let me just have a look into that question. So I'm just going to remind you that your policy does cover you for $102,000, sorry, $102,000 for death due to any cause. The policy also offers a terminal illness advance payment, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, which you have you if you were diagnosed for 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, you can claim your full benefit as a living benefit. This could help you with medical costs etcetera and within and then included in the life benefit is a $10,000 advanced payment that your beneficiary can request which could help you with the costs associated with a funeral. So I believe you will be able to have an advanced payment of the $10,000 to assist with funeral costs. However, the remainder of the amount will, I guess, process a little bit further.
[8 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, like how do you mean?
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Mm. Hmm. Yep. OK. All right, let me just, umm, do you mind if I pop you on a quick hold and I'll confirm with my manager how it's actually divided and in saying that, umm included in the life benefit with that 10,000 advanced payment. I just need to find out that one for you, Mary. Maybe more than two minutes, but I'll be back as quick as I can. OK. Thank you.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Sorry I'm a little bit confused now because I remember when I signed up with the policy the girl that I signed up was, she mentioned to me that so when I do die it will be $200,000 so cool, cool, no problem, sure.
[11 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Hi there. Mary, are you there?
[11 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I'm here, Sandra.
[11 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Thanks for thank. Thanks for holding. OK, so I just confirmed this one with my manager as I'm not fully trained in life. So I just wanted to gauge a better way I can explain this one to you.
[12 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So with the $10,000, this one is just considered to be the advanced payment. So you will receive the full amount $102,000. However, what will be transferred over to the beneficiary as you would require funds immediately for funeral, the $10,000 will be processed much sooner than the remainder of the funds which may take further processing to till that is received. But yes to answer your question, you will receive the whole amount being 102 dollars, $102,000.
[12 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Ah, I see. So it's 100 and thousand, right?
[12 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : No, it's 102,000.
[12 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : A 103,000.
[12 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yes, your benefit is 102,000. Did you apply at the start and it was 100?
[13 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Oh, was that is is that one sorry, that's a little bit sorry. I'm I'm sorry for two.
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : That's OK.
[13 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Is that a heap? I'm sorry, like so is there sorry, darling. So that's 100 and 2000.
[13 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Say that again is not what your MM Hmm, yes, correct. So 102 for 102 and then you followed by three more zeros. So that would be 102,000. Looks like your benefit has increased by 2%. MMM, that's it. One second.
[13 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, yeah, I hope so, because when I remembered, sorry about when I said to you 200,000, that's just 100, but it's it's absolutely correct. It is 102,000.
[13 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[13 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : I just had a look at my e-mail.
[13 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Oh.
[13 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : But The thing is, but the thing that worried me the most is why has it gone up?
[13 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Oh yes, because we have the automatic sum insured increase sum which has increased annual annually. So it looks like you had an increase around about said this year and then you have and then you have another one at said next year when it comes time to your renewal date. Your premium looks like it has also increased since since you've joined. So you were paying $9.34. However, you do pay $10 now and not only has your premium gone up, but so does your benefit amount by 2%. Hmm.
[14 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Oh wow, wow, oh wow, that's amazing.
[14 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it's a big difference.
[14 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Wow, that is quite a lot.
[14 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Hmm. That's OK. I don't apologize. Mm, hmm. Mm, hmm.
[14 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : I'm so sorry, but that means can I ask you a question further? Can I choose one or more beneficiaries?
[14 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Beneficiary. Yeah, absolutely. You have the T choice of up to five.
[14 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Oh wow, that's all my children.
[14 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Oh, lovely. Yeah. So you can divide it up across all five children or you can choose your favourites. But yeah, I will. Or. Yeah.
[15 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I was wondering if you can please send me a beneficiary form.
[15 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yes, yes, of course. I've actioned that one already for you and that has been done. Is there anything else you want? Wanted to know.
[15 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : I'm so sorry to take too much of your time.
[15 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK. Oh, OK.
[15 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : I would prefer action one for my husband, for his beneficiary.
[15 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Do you have authority to speak on your husband's behalf? On his policy? Yeah, you too. Oh, OK, look, let me just close this one off for now. OK, so while I'm in your policy, I'm just going to have to close it off and leave some notes and then I'll go look at your husband's one in a moment.
[15 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : If I do because I'm the one that's paying this account with, sure. No problem.
[15 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, Bear with me before I do that. If you do receive a letter in the mail regarding this payment we discussed on your life insurance, no further action is required as we have already arranged collection of the missed premium today. OK, so if you get any letter in the mail, just disregard that one and I'll close this one off. Won't be too long.
[15 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Sure, sure, sure. That's fine.
[16 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK. Thank you.
[16 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : I just got home after a long day.
