[6 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Wonderful. So with that, I just need to make sure that everything's all done there for you. Uh, OK, that's clear, that's clear, that's clear. And then, umm, OK, perfect, wonderful. OK, perfect, wonderful. So last, what I can let you know in reference to how the last four answers, your application needs to be referred to the underwriter for assessment. So what that means is that we'll just send them through the details about your application as well as the test that we noted down for you with all the information about how it came back clear and all the, and, and things like that. Now, if the underwriter comes back and they've approved the policy with no changes, then you'll be covered under this policy for deaths due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. Now, on top of that, there is a terminally ill advanced payments included in the cover as well. Umm, so umm, so if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we'll pay your Hun your benefit amount to you in full and then you can use, use the money however you need to from that point and for whatever purposes you need.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, alright, OK.
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Now, umm now last, I do just need to let you know that the premium has now risen. So for the 1,000,000 that we looked at, the premium has now risen to $89.14 per fortnight and that's only when we were just disclosing your family history of cancer there.
[8 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Umm, now with that, how did that sound there for the 1,000,000? Does that still sound alright, or did you want to look at something lower as well?
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Can I look at something lower please?
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. Of course. That's OK. That's all right. How much per Fortnite was most suitable for you? I'll let you know of what benefit amount test matches that.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Fortnite.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. How much per Fortnite can you afford?
[8 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : I can afford the 80, but I don't really wanna do that much and like make myself maybe struggle once in a blue moon.
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course.
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : So that's, can we just try for 50? What? What would that give?
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, 50 or Fortnite.
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. Let's take a look. So it was 50 a fortnight. Umm, OK, SO50A fortnight. Let's see. Thank you. Uh, I'm just adjusting this for you now. Just bear with me one moment, OK? So if it was 50, OK, I think I found the level of cover. I think it's around 550,000. But let me just bring this up for you. Just bear with me one moment.
[9 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : 550,000.
[9 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : I think so, but let me just look at that for you. I'll just let you know. I just need to reconfirm all the details there. Uh, OK, let's see. MMM OK, so we choose that, yes. Uh, OK, perfect. Wonderful. So, uh, with that, if let's say we looked at something lower there for you, uh, we can still get this one referred off for you for around $50 a fortnight to make it nice and comfortable. We could still look at insuring you for around $550,000 worth of cover and that would be $48.08 per fortnight. Umm, so that would still cover you for the benefits there that I touched on before. It's just for the cheaper premium there for you, $48.08 a fortnight. Are you happy with the five? Yeah, Yeah, of course. Yeah. So it's with those 3 covers included.
[10 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Would I would I still would that thing still be there though that like if I was to get sick, use would pay, you know, OK.
[10 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : It's just a different benefit amount that we're insuring you for. So the terminally in advance payment is still included in there. So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we'll pay the benefit amount to you in full. For example, that 550,000.
[11 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[11 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[11 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : And I wouldn't think because I missed accent. So this this covers me pretty much in all ways except for four side.
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so if it comes back fully approved from the underwriter with no changes, you'll be covered for deaths due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[11 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK, cool. Now.
[11 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, No.
[11 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Is there anything that I should know about?
[11 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Is there any what? Sorry, umm, it it depends. Is there, is there anything specific on your mind? Because everything I'll just be reading out to you anyway about the cover.
[11 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[11 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So, umm, I just need to let you know about the premium, the way that the premium works. Uh, please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year. Now, Lars, in addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amounts will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. Umm, but last, you can opt out of this indexation each year, and that just comes with the renewal of your policy documents. You just need to let us know if you'd like to opt out of that.
[12 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[12 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Now what I can do is I can note down your payment details and I'll read out to you the declaration. So I can just get this, uh, sent off to the underwriter for them to approve for you. Now, the commencement of your cover will be subject to the final assessment by the insurer. Like I mentioned before, if the insurer comes back and approves without any changes at all, then I'll be able to accept the policy on your behalf and then we'll get your documents sent out to you by e-mail and via post as well.
[12 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. So.
[12 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Now with that, the policy does give you a 30 day cooling off. So if you decide that the policy is no longer suitable for you and cancel within 30 days, then, uh, 30 days of your first payment, then you will receive a full refund of your premium unless a claim has been made now.
[12 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. So sorry, can you explain that last bit again for me, please?
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course, of course. So what that is, is it's called a 30 day cooling off.
[13 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah.
[13 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : So what that means is if you decide that the policy is no longer suitable for you and you cancel within 30 days of your first payments, then what you will receive is a full refund of your premium unless the claim has been made. Yeah. Does that make sense?
[13 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, I understand.
[13 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect, wonderful. Now with that, you wouldn't have to make any upfront payments today. So what we do is we select the payment date that works for you within the near future and then it can be every fortnight from then onwards. Umm, last, when would you, let's say you know, the underwriter came back fully approved, no changes. When would you like your payments to start?
[13 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, soon as possible, please.
[13 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, so as, as soon as possible. So, umm, they may get back to me. Umm, maybe even sometime tomorrow. So would, would, would tomorrow work for you?
[14 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : No, sorry. No, it has to be on a Wednesday night.
[14 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, no worries. So we try to deduct from the accounts between 2:00 AM and 4:00 PM. Do you, do you usually get your, you know, a payment on a Wednesday night?
[14 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yes.

[14 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : And I get it at 6:30.
[14 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. Oh, OK, OK, just because if, let's say, you get your payment out on a Wednesday night, since we tried to do it in the morning, it'll be based on what time your bank lets us do it. We can do Thursday morning for you.
