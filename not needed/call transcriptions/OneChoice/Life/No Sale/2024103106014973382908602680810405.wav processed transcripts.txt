And please now all calls are recorded and the advice provide is limited to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they are suitable for your needs. We do not consider your personal circumstances. So thank you, Rakesh, for going online to the inquiry with us this morning. If you don't mind me asking, what has made you decide to look into life insurance?
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : I like uh being having the incidents makes like you know, everything like smoked. So we don't know what happened next. So it's better to have insurance.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yes. You're preparing for the future. Yeah. OK. And so do you have any kids or a partner?
[1 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I have a partner, but but no, no kids.
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : You have a partner, OK, No kids? Not yet. Maybe in the future.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, maybe in the future. That's right. Right now.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, it's a little while away for you yet. OK, great. And request do you have any loans or debts like a mortgage or a personal loan?
[2 minutes][Customer] : MMM. I do like have like uh, some personal loan but not move it at the moment.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, great. So with the life insurance, it is designed to be able to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. So with the benefit amount that you choose to be insured for, that money could be used to help pay off any loans or debts that you may have. Even if it is your personal loan that you've mentioned or even if you do decide to get a mortgage later on in the future, the benefit amount could be used to help pay off, you know, those sorts of debts. Also with the policy, you do get to nominate up to five beneficiaries to be able to receive the amount. So if you wanted to listen and your partner, you're more than welcome to do that. Or anyone else you are close to and care about, like parents or siblings. And if anything change in the future, Rick Cash and you do decide to have a family of your own, you are welcome to contact us to update your beneficiary nomination at any time. So your beneficiary is the people that you'd be leaving the money behind to. OK. Yeah.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : MMM, yeah, that's it.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : And your loved ones are able to request an advance payout of $10,000 to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses that you might have. So sometimes it can be quite hard on the family to compare the lump sum to pay for a funeral, especially if death is sudden. It can be quite a hard time. With our policy, your loved ones are able to request that advance part and it is generally paid within 24 to 48 hours in advance of receiving irrelevant documentation. OK. And we do keep everything very simple for you. And what I mean by that is everything is done over the front. OK? So there's no forms for you to fill in or medical checks for you to complete with the doctor. What we simply do request is we go through some helpful last set questions with you on the phone and there's questions that we ask you. They'll confirm whether you can get cover with us. They'll also confirm the final price and the terms of the policy for you. So what we'll do together now is we'll go into some costs, we'll go into a quote. I do have a couple of quick questions to ask you to bring up a quote. The first one is asking, have you had a secret in the last 12 months?
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : OK, no, no, I don't.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, good. And you and you, is your current annual income $50,000 or more?

[4 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK. And you do get to choose a benefit amount from $100,000 all the way up to $2,000,000. What amount would you like me to quote you on?
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : MMM.

[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : And you mentioned 1.5 million, that is an indicative premium of $61.72 per fortnight.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK. So it's like a $20 difference like for fortnight.

[5 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : That's right, 1,000,000. Of course you can. So $1 million will be an indicative premium of $42.11 per fortnight. How does the $1 million sound to you?
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : MMM, yes, it's good. I can I I need to like change with one to just like one or two. It's like 42.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, what was that, Rakesh?
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Umm, I I need to like have some time to think like with one to just like 1,000,000 or 2 million.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's completely fine. That's completely fine.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : So if I haven't, yeah, you haven't decided that one.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : If you would have a yeah, that's, that's OK. If you want to have a think about the amount that you want, keeping in mind that with the benefit amount that you choose. So for example, if you choose like $1 million or 1.5 million, you're welcome to contact us to a party. Increase your level of cover up until the age of 70, subject to eligibility at the time. And if you did choose something like $2,000,000, for example, being the highest amount, you're actually welcome. I mean, any other amount lower than that you can do as well. But you're actually welcome to try to decrease your level of cover any time. Try the policy.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, So do you want to keep it at a higher amount or do you want to keep it at 1,000,000? What amount if you would be most suitable for you currently?
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : MMM, maybe 2 minutes.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's leave it there for you. OK. We do also have two options that you can add to your policy, an additional premium. So there's two options, uh, serious illness cover title and permanent disability cover. So with the serious illness cover cash, it pays for lumps and benefit if you were to suffer an insured event covered under this policy. So with the benefit amount, uh, you could use that. So any rehabilitation costs you could even use as an income replacement while you are recovering. And the insured events that are covered under serious illness, a heart attack, cancer, stroke, or if you were under the coronary bypass surgery. Each of these events defined within the policy and each claim is assessed against these definitions. Did you want a quote on this option? Yep. So you can choose a benefit amount from 50,000 to 500,000 for serious illness. What amount would you like going to quote you on? That's right. OK. So like 250 or 200?
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, maybe can I get the price like with uh, with the quoting, how much is gonna be added 50,000 to 500 thousand, 50,000 to 500,000, right, maybe like in the middle Yeah and 2:50.
[8 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, So $250,000 a serious illness is $13.27 per fortnight which will bring a total fortnightly premium to $94.62. Now with serious illness, your cash, any insured events that become apparent before or during the first three months of the serious illness option commencing will not be covered. For details of all exclusions I said in your policy document. Please also be aware that any payment made under serious illness cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount and if you also purchase title and permanent disability cover, the TPD benefit amount will also reduce when you have a successful serious illness claim. So you happy to know add this optional coverage to your quote.
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm happy to that.
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, great. The second option that I've got is total permanent disability cover. Do you work a minimum of 20 hours per week?
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : MMM I I I do like more than 20 hours probably.
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK, great. So that's a yes for that one. So with TPD it pays a lump sum benefit in the event you suffer the loss of liens or site or unable to work for a period of six consecutive months and they're not able to return to work in any field which you're experienced, educated or trained or if you were to suffer loss of independent existence.
[9 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : MMM, So what does it does that does the disability or something like that?
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Now with this option, there is an exclusion under this any intentional self-inflicted injury, Sir, because do you want to quote on this option as well for TPD title and permanent disability? It pays a lump sum benefit in the event that you suffered a loss of limbs or sites or unable to work for a period of six consecutive months and you're not able to return to work in any field which you're experienced, educated or trained or if you were to sell a loss of independent existence.
[10 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : No, I was just passed that one.
[10 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine with UMM with that option, you're actually welcome to apply added to your policy up until the age of 59, subject to eligibility at the time. OK, So now that you mentioned before that you wanted to have a think about the benefit amount and then you decided that the $2,000,000 was suitable. So you are more than welcome to have a think about the amount. The other option that you have are cash is that I can take you to your house from last questions. That way I can confirm whether you can get cover with us along with the final price and the terms of the policy for you. How does that sound?
