You did mention that, umm, you were advised by your doctor that you had suspected IBS. Umm again, as it was suspected, it's not technically correct to capture that in a disorder of the stomach, bowel or pancreas as it is against suspected. What we'll need to do is just capture that in a different part of the application. Umm, as it is just so it is noted down, umm, and then we'll go from there as well.
[1 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : So.
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so just besides what you've mentioned to me, can I just confirm for a disorder of the stomach, bowel or pancreas, is that a yes or a no?

Bladder or urinary tract disorder, Kidney disorder. Sorry, just cut out again. I'm so sorry yesterday, OK. Thought disorder or disease, sleep apnea or asthma, excluding childhood asthma. OK, next question. Now it is relating in the past three years.

[1 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, I am going to answer a yes to this question. This is where we'll just note down the suspected IBS. Can I ask when did the doctor advise the suspected IBS?
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Like 10 years ago.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : 10 years ago?
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's an about. I don't remember.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's OK. I'll put roughly. And if you don't mind me asking as well, what was the reason you initially get went to the doctor?

[3 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Probably like 3 months before I submit a good advice, but it it's not been like that anymore.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : And so that was consistent for two months, OK, Yeah, I understand that.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : So stay away from certain foods and good.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, not a worry though. So that was umm, it's all resolved now. It's not ongoing anymore. OK. So I'm just going down. It was consistent for. Did you say it was three months? OK. And then so you went to your GP, was it?
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : No, no, Yeah, yes, correct. Yeah.
[4 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : I'm just going down the advise you have suspected IBS but nothing diagnosed.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, 'cause they did like, nothing diagnosed. They took scans and they did blood tests and everything was normal. So they might have sort of saying there's nothing else. They said it's that 'cause it's one thing that you can't actually, I guess, diagnose properly.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yep Yep right thank you. So I did scans and tests and everything came back 100% clear and normal.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : So Yep.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK. And this occurred roughly 10 years ago. And has it been around that time since you've actually had symptoms or does it come and go?
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, like I said, it comes and goes with certain food, so it's just managed. It's just, you know, if I have certain foods that can play up a little bit, but I just stay away from those foods and I don't have an issue.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Thank you. Do you require any medication? OK, umm, there's just a few drop down questions. Umm, just to take you through it. Sorry.

[7 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, All OK. Thank you so much for your honesty with everything. I do appreciate it as well. Umm, that's all we need to capture as part of that. So we'll move on to the next question. The next question asks, other than what you have already told me about, are you contemplating seeking medical advice for any symptoms you are currently experiencing within the next two weeks? Sorry, Alicia. Thank you. I'm not sure what's happening with the line we have. Sometimes it's very clear, but then sometimes it goes unclear. And then the second time you say it's perfectly clear, doesn't make a lot of sense.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Well, OK, no, no, maybe I'm amble.
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : You're fine. It's not you. Honestly, it just sounds very crackly. Oh, like we've only got a few more questions to go.

Oh good though. OK just bear with me. Just finalizing this now. So just so you know, I completely agree with you. My biggest fear in life is heights. So don't know how anyone can do any of those kinds of things.
[8 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, they're crazy.
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : There really are. But sorry to be a bit of a paid Alicia. I just need to clarify that question because you said yeah, No, I just need to confirm for that last question. Is that a yes or no? Perfect. OK, good. And one other question I just needed to confirm with you, umm, just for the question of does your work require you to go underground worker heights above 20 meters start to that's below 40 meters.

If it comes back fully approved, no changes anyway, it really will be as simple as me giving you a quick call saying, hey, that's all been fully approved.
[11 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : With a press bill button we can put that policy in and immediately enforce for you and then while your application is being assessed, you will be covered for accidental death, which pays out if death was a due. Sorry, repeat that which pays out if death was due to a direct result of an accident.
[11 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.

[12 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : The only thing is with this I can see you have a birthday coming up. So happy birthday from Monday. Umm just to let you know, if we do select the Tuesday it would actually change the premium because it is basing it on being a year older from that point. So the premium would then be $23.84 per fortnight. So if you wanted to look in the previous price, umm, for for that year, then I would have to do it before then. So I'll leave that decision up to you. What would you like to do?
[12 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : So, so if I was to start the premiums like Friday for example, I would get one year at the cheaper premium.
[12 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : That's correct. I'll bring up that premium again of what it initially was. Yeah, it's sorry, was $22.00 and just double checking the sentence, it was $22.50 the fortnight for the 700,000.
