We'll be looking at some life insurance for you today, so I'll take you through the cover and get you some pricing so we can see how that sounds for you. Can I just have your first and last name, please?
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Oh, Patrick Petty.

[2 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect, wonderful. Now Patrick, before I proceed, I do just need to let you know that all calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is limited to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they are suitable for your needs. We do not consider your personal circumstances now, umm, with that umm, in terms of how the insurance works and what we need to do is just, you know, go through some pricing, see what you meant may sound suitable for you and then get you approved for the cover by going through some health and lifestyle questions for you as well. This just confirms your outcome and just let you know of what the final pricing and terms are. Umm Patrick, what is your home address please?
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : My home address is umm, 8350 State Highway 35, Audi 300 Bay.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Thanks so much for that, Sir. 8350 State Highway 30 feet. Uh, no, it's State Highway 35, White Highway Bay. OK, perfect. Now, is that your postal address as well?
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Wonderful. Now. OK, OK. All right, perfect. Now with that touch it through the way that the cover works. Firstly, there's three benefits that we insure you for.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So first and foremost, it's a death benefit in the insurance, which is your benefit amount that's paid out to your loved ones if you pass away up to a maximum of five people. The next thing that we insure you for is a terminal illness benefit. So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, what we would do is pay the benefit amounts to you in full whilst you're still alive. And then Patrick, included in that cover is an advance payout of $10,000 that goes to your loved ones. That claims time to look after any funeral expenses or anything like that for you as well.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So that's the three key features and benefits there for you within the cover. I'll bring up the pricing for you now. Patrick, I just need to confirm, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't smoke cigarettes.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Right, Perfect, That's good to hear. That's very good to hear. Now with the amounts that we can look at, it goes anywhere from $100,000 all the way up to $500,000 worth of cover. What amount would you like me to quote you on?
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Oh, 100,000 partly. OK, well, what else is that minimum absence? Is that minimum?
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So if with the life insurance the minimum is 100,000 within the car?
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK then yes, yes. What about the fifth one? The this insurance? What about the this insurance?
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Umm so we have a funeral insurance as well. Both of them are designed to pay out if you pass away.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[6 minutes][Agent] : So which one were you more looking for?
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Oh, wow. Are you life insurance or? Yeah, Life insurance, yes.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK but with the life insurance it's minimum of 100,000. With the funeral cover it's 3000 up to 30,000.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Single color cover 37.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK, all right, So what I can do then is I can go through how the funeral insurance works, umm, and then, uh, also get you some pricing for that side. So I'll just switch that over for you now. Umm Now with the funeral insurance, it's guaranteed acceptance for you since you're a New Zealand resident residing in New Zealand between 18 and 79. Now in terms of how that works, umm, we'll pay out a cash benefit that goes from 3000 to $30,000. Umm and your loved ones can use the money, whoever they need to. Now the key benefits that are covered within this insurance firstly is an accidental death benefit. So if your death was due to an accident, we will pay out triple the benefit amounts that you're insured for. The next thing that we cover is an accidental serious injury benefit.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So if you were to suffer an injury like quadriplegia or paraplegia and if that occurred before the policy anniversary that follows your 75th birthday, we will also pay out triple the benefit amounts, umm as well that gets paid out to you whilst you're still alive. Umm, Now for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. And then after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause and that's for as long as you hold your policy in place.
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Now in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we are going to pay the benefit amount to you in full whilst you're still alive. And then you can use the money however you need to from there. Umm, if that's for medical costs or any other expenses as well.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : And then the final three things we do for you, Patrick, I just designed to give you some extra support and assistance in your later use of life. First thing we're going to do is we're going to stop your premiums, so you don't need to pay anything any further after age 85.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Second thing we'll do is automatically increase your benefit amount by 25% to give you some bonus cover. So that's, you know, for example, you insured the $10,000 will increase that to 12 and a half, $1000. Now third and final thing we do is give you an early cash out option. So at any time after your 85th birthday, you can choose to end your cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. Now if you don't end your cover, we will insure you up until the day before you turn 100. Umm, we're at that point. There is a payout of both of those, the benefit amounts in the bonus cover. How does that sound so far, though? OK, perfect. Wonderful. I'll, I'll bring up the pricing for you. Umm, Patrick, did you have a preference whether you're getting buried or cremated? Did you have a preference whether you'd be getting buried or cremated?
[9 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Pardon, umm.
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's all right. That's OK. Just because in terms of the average cost, the average cost of a standard funeral in New Zealand based on a burial comes in at around $9000. Well, the average cost of a standard cremation in New Zealand comes in at around $5000. Umm. But once the payout's been made, your loved ones can spend the money however they need to at the time. So you know, if you want to cover funeral costs and even a little extra as well, more than happy for you to do that. What amount would you like me to quote you on that or the funeral cover? Yes. So what I meant, would you like me to quote you on anywhere from 3000 up to 30,000? OK. So if we look at $30,000 worth of cover per fortnight, that would be $106.29 per fortnight if we did $30,000.
[10 minutes][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[10 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Now with that your premiums are level, so they are designed to stay consistent year on year. But how does that sound though?
[10 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Sounds good. Sounds good for me.
[10 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, perfect. Now with that in mind, I do just need to confirm just because, umm, I've heard your partner in the background assisting you throughout the call. Is there any reason why that she may need to assist you while we've been going through the call?
[10 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, because, umm, I do need help, you know? Umm, I'll call you, that's why.
[10 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, so even though you can't read, can you understand everything I've been taking you through and?
[10 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I'm done. I'm I'm a partly deaf too.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, so you just struggle with hearing. Uh, just sometimes you can struggle with hearing.
[11 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Mainly I'm meant to be going to get my ears checked.
[11 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK. Just because with that, we do have the duty of care just because all of the calls get recorded and listened back to. So the, so I can, I can, I can still do the funeral insurance for you. And the only thing is, since you mentioned that it is just because because you're part you're, you're, you know, partially deaf. Umm, we do have a Judy of care to ensure everyone has a thorough and complete understanding and everything we take them through. If you are happy with how the insurance sounds, I can set the insurance up with your partner instead.
[11 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[11 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Umm, just for the time being, just because we have that Judy of care where if you would, if you're OK with that, she can pay for the policy on your behalf, but I would just need to take her to the cover alone. So it's just because we have a Judy of care. It's just because they'll listen back to ensure that I make sure I've done everything in in accordance with that code of conduct and things like that. OK, So are you happy for me to set up the cover with your partner just just just by speaking to her only. OK, perfect. Wonderful. If you could just pass the phone over to her, I can speak to her to do the cover for you.
[12 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yes, yes, yes.
[12 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Hi. Hello. Sorry, I just said it's Bonnie again from One Choice Insurance. Umm, just for security purposes, could I just get you to confirm your partner's full name and date of birth please?

[12 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Umm Now with that, I'm more than happy to do the funeral cover for Patrick, just because you know, he had mentioned that it is partially death. So do we. We just have a duty of care to make sure that whoever takes up the policy has a clear and thorough understanding of everything.
[13 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Now umm, with that in mind. So the 30,000 we had looked at for him was for $106.29 a fortnight. Are you happy to pay for the policy on his behalf? OK, no, it's perfect, Wonderful. So, umm, I just need to confirm with you, uh, just verbally that he is a New Zealand resident currently residing in New Zealand.

Only after the first 12 months, Patrick will be covered for deaths due to any cause. Now in addition, there is a Terminal illness benefit, which means after holding a policy for 12 months, if Patrick were first diagnosed with the terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we'll pay the benefit amounts to him in full whilst he's still alive. For him to use however he needs to. Umm.
[14 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : None.
[14 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Now in terms of the benefits included in the cover, after age 85, no more premiums need to be paid on the policy. We will then automatically increase the benefit amounts by 25% to give some bonus cover on top.
[14 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[14 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : And then there is the early cash out option. But anytime after your 85th birthday you can choose to end your cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. If not, we are going to insure Patrick up until the day before he turns 100.
[14 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah.
[14 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So just designed to give that full life support for the $30,000. It was $106.29 per fortnight. Umm, with that being a level premium. So it's designed to stay consistent year on year up until we turned 85.
