[2 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep. No.
[2 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Now, when when we went through those questions, the whole application, the application questions, has there been any changes to those answers since I went through them with you? OK, perfect. That's awesome. Now, anything else that you're not sure on? Just before we go ahead with this, do you want me to ask you any other questions or anything or?
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : So did you have any questions about Oh, I, we just had one because I couldn't remember when you said about this, is it 5% increase per year?
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, OK.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Was that on the premium or like does the price I pay increase P by 5% per year or is it?
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yep, great question.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : I couldn't remember which way round it was.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's OK. So I'll run through it quickly with you again. So the policy is going to cover you for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Now don't forget in addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment. It's included in the cover. Sadly, if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay you that kind of fall. You get the whole amount of money. OK, now here's this piece here. So please be aware that your premium is stepped. Now that's your premium what you pay every fortnight. So it's stepped, OK, which means which means it would generally increase each year.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK. Right.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Now it in addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount, your sum insured, your benefit amount will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. And you can opt out of this indexation each year if you want to.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a problem, you can do that. Which means if you do decide to opt out of that indexation each year or some years, you get that choice. So your benefit amount won't increase with that 5% with associated increases in premium, but also your premium will be a bit lower.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, that makes sense for you.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yes.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : And that's answers that question that does it as well for you.

[5 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : No.
