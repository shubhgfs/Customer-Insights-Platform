[14 seconds][Customer] : Got it in the second. Good.
[14 seconds][Agent] : Hi there, Emma, it's Ethan. Hi, my name is Ethan. I'm calling from One Choice Insurance. How are you today?
[20 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[21 seconds][Agent] : That's good. Give you a call today regarding the life insurance cover that you requested a quote for from us this morning.
[28 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[28 seconds][Agent] : So the purpose of the call is to go through the main features and benefits of the cover with you, don't do some pricing and of course, answer any questions that you might have had for us as well. Just before we do get started, I'll let you know that all of our calls are recorded and any advice I provide is limited to the products that we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they are suitable for your needs. We don't consider your personal circumstances, so I can't provide any financial or personal advice, but I am more than happy to answer any questions that you've got for me. Of course. Uh, could I confirm I'm speaking with Emma Whitety?
[48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's correct.
[1 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yep, thank you. And I've got your date of birth as the 25th of the 6th 1963.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yep, thank you. And also just to confirm that you're a female New Zealand resident and your e-mail is moytd67@gmail.com.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : So correct.
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yep, perfect. Thank you so much for that. So just opening up a new quote for you and thank you so much for taking the time to put through that inquiry to us. Is this the first time that you're looking into life insurance or do you currently have some cover in place at the moment?
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : No, it's this time.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Oh sure, no problem. Well, with our life insurance, what we've designed it to do is to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. And this benefit could be used to help maintain their lifestyle by helping them pay off a mortgage, loans, or any other costs involved in raising a family. So basically it's there to give you the Peace of Mind that if something happened to you, your family would have that financial security. Now, it is a very straightforward cover. So again, this primarily covers you when you pass away for financial protection for your family. But also they can request an advanced payout of $10,000 at the time of claim to help with any of your funeral costs as well, or any other final expenses that come up at the time. We also cover you for terminal illness, which we'll go through in a bit more detail later on. Uh, but apart from funeral expenses, was there anything that you were looking at covering for your family when you pass away?
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : No, they're the main ones, yes.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : I just, OK, so primarily funeral expenses, OK, yeah, for sure. We could definitely have a look at the life insurance for you. And if that one doesn't work out for whatever reason, we do have a funeral insurance cover designed specifically for those expenses as well. Uh, which we can explore with you.
[3 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So we do, we do keep everything nice and simple over the phone. Uh, there's no forms to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete. We simply take you through health and lifestyle questions over the phone as this will determine the pricing and terms of the policy for you as well. Umm, so just beginning with a couple questions. First of all, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? None. That's good.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : No, I've never smoked.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : And oh awesome. And uh, look, the average cost of a funeral in New Zealand is 8000 and $10,000. What I'll let you know is that the minimum amount you can choose to be insured for I is actually $100,000 with us. Umm, and the maximum being 500,000 is what we can look at as well based on your age. Uh, we can look in between those two figures as well. Uh, but how much cover did you want to have a look at today with us?
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, around about one. 5200.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. OK, we'll look at the 200. If that's too much, we can drop it down to the 150 for you.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : And of course, any leftover money for the like, any leftover money from the claim that your family does get to keep as well. Just wanted to let you know about that. So for the $200,000 of cover, you'd be looking at a fortnightly payment of $62.96 per fortnight.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So again, that's $62.96 per fortnight. How is that sounding for you?
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : No, it's great actually.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. All right, well, we'll go through the health questions, uh, which, uh, determines your eligibility for the cover as well as the, the final pricing and the terms of the policy. We can insure you under as well. So I won't dwell too much on the pricing just in case it, it goes up due to your health and lifestyle. But if it even if it does go out for that level of cover, we can drop it down to something lower to make it more affordable for you anyway, if need be.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Just letting you know in advance, could I have your address before we get started on that, please? Yep. Mason Terrace. Yep. Thank you. Awesome. And that's in the post code of 4501, is that correct?

[5 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yep, thank you.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it is.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : And is that the same as your postal address as well Survey. Thank you so much for that. Now I do need to also read you out a pre underwriting disclosure statement.

So it just simply says here, please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes. We collect your personal information to provide insurance quotes, issue cover and other other related services. We will share this with your insurer and may share it with other service providers for the purpose of administering your policy or handling claims. Our privacy policy tells you more, including how to access and correct your information and lodge complaints about breaches of privacy. I also need to inform you about your duty of disclosure before you enter into a life insurance contract. You have a legal duty to provide to us any information you know or could reasonably be expected to know, which may affect our decision to insure you and on what terms. You do not need to tell us things that we already know or should know as an insurer, or which reduces the risk we insure. You have this, Judy, until the time we enter into the contract. If you fail to disclose the matter or you make a false statement in answer to our questions, we may be able to decline a claim, impose new conditions on your policy, or avoid your policy entirely. Do you understand this?
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Correct. Yep, I do.

[20 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[20 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : All right, No problem. OK. Umm, all right, so just letting up the results here for you. Umm, OK, all right. So in reference to your health and lifestyle answers, your application needs to be referred to the underwriter for assessment PRI primarily, uh, because of the, uh, because you've had three fam immediate family members that have unfortunately, you know, had cancer prior to age 60. Umm if if you are approved for the cover, this Pol policy will cover you for death due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months. There is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we will pay your claim in full and you, and you will still, of course, uh, be able to, your family will still be, will, will still of course be able to request $10,000 at the time of claim to help with any funeral expenses, etcetera.
[21 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[22 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Uh, also wanted to mention that you can leave the money to up to five people as well. Once the cover's in place, you'll have a beneficiary form where you can just simply note down up to five people to leave the money to. Also, please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year. The good news is that after going through the health and lifestyle questionnaire, I can't see that there have been any changes to your quote. So currently you are still looking at 6296 a fortnight.
[22 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Mm, Hmm.
[22 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : And in addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 5% with associated increase in premium. However, you can opt out of this indexation each year. So once you get your renewal statement next year, you could just simply give us a call and advise us that you wanna opt out of that indexation and then we can help you out with that over the phone.
[22 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, OK.
[23 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so look, if, if you were approved with no changes, umm, this is the terms that you would be insured on that. So what we do from here is that we simply note down your payment details and read you a declaration so that if it's assessed by the underwriter and approved with no changes, then I just simply click a button and then we send out all of your documents to you. Uh, but the first payment doesn't come out until your chosen day at which we do over the phone as well with you. So is that something that you're happy to proceed with?
[23 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[23 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Uh, Yep, Yep. Awesome. And look, while your application is being assessed, you will be covered for accidental death, which pays out if death was due to a direct result of an accident. You don't need to pay any extra for this. Umm, it's simply this so that whilst it's being assessed, you have some form of cover in place and cover under this last until the insurer makes a decision on your application or 30 days from today, whichever is earlier. Uh, but of course, uh, the commencement of your cover will be subject to final assessment by the insurer. If the insurer approves cover without any changes, what I'll do is I'll, I'll record your acceptance of this policy now, and if it's approved with no changes, like I mentioned, we'll send out all of your policy information to your e-mail and postal address as well.
[24 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[24 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and I should, I mean, just based on previous experience, I should, you know, hear something back from them hopefully by the end of today anyway, uh, they're pretty on the ball with it. Umm, but we generally collect payment within the next 7 days. So when would be the best day for the first one to come out if it's approved with no changes?
[24 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I can set up automatic payments, so that's all good. So seven days. Oh, no.
[24 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Oh, we don't, because we don't have like an account for you to pay that into.
[24 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[24 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So we do you like either a direct debit from your bank account?
[25 minutes][Customer] : Direct debit.
[25 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, or we can write down a card, whichever you're more comfortable with. Yeah.
[25 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, OK. What doesn't really a Monday?
[25 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So do you know what day would be best for the first one to come out if it's approved with no changes on Monday? Yeah, sure. OK. We can do this upcoming Monday if you'd like. Yep, no worries. So we'll have the first payment come out on Monday if it's approved with no changes, which is the 18th, and then every fortnight thereafter on a Monday would be other payment collection dates. I'll just need to also note down your preferred method of payment as well. So that like I mentioned, if it is approved with no changes, then I just simply click a few buttons and then we send out all of your policy information.
[25 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, yeah, yeah.
[25 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : And then the the payments automatically come out of either the bank account or through the card. Would you prefer to note down a card or a bank account for this one?
[25 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Oh, a card? Easier.
[25 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Yeah, no worries. So I'll just need to. So I'll just let you know that. So for security purposes while obtaining your card details, the call recording will stop and will recommence after we have collected your details. So I'll just go ahead and pause that call recording for you now. None. None. No, I don't get too long. All right, perfect. So please be advised that the call recording has now resumed for quality and monitoring purposes.
[27 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[27 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : What we do now is we, uh, is I'll read out the, umm, I'll read out the declaration to you, uh, which basically goes through the terms and conditions of the cover so that you can, uh, you know, accept the, the terms and conditions basically, uh, before the policy is in place. And then if there's any changes, I will definitely make contact with you before I start making up so that you're aware of the changes as well. So I'll just read this out to you now, which would just take me about 5 minutes or so.
[28 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Go ahead.
[28 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you for your, for your patience there. So it just simply says here, thank you Moy today it is important you understand the following information.
