[1 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, yeah.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : If you don't mind me asking, what has made you decide to look at some life insurance? Yeah.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : No, I already have my life insurance with, uh, ANZ I think yeah, but I'm just want to get quotation done, so just compare it. What's are the in and out from you guys? Who's better?
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Of course, Yeah, of course. What's great, obviously you've got some cover and you see the importance of having life insurance. Did you originally take that policy out because of a mortgage or because of children?
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : No, no, My policy has been there since I have my house.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Oh, yes. OK, so you, you do have a mortgage.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I have mortgage. I own my house.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, Beautiful. OK. Well, that's a great reason to have some cover in place.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : But just wife. Yeah.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : And you know, your, your mortgage is quite a, a big debt and do you have a bank case as well that you want to look after if anything happens to you just a wife or not just a wife, But yes, your wife. OK.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Why?
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So as you know, the life insurance, it's designed to be able to provide financial protection for your loved ones, your lump sum payment, if you were to pass away, that benefit amount you choose, it could be used to help help your mortgage or any other debts you may have.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : And it could also be used to help support your wife if anything happens to you, just to be able to provide her with some financial security and she can, you know, pass what's left to the mortgage agent, you know, just be able to to enjoy her life that money could give you to support her with the policy. You actually get to nominate up to five people to receive the amount. So if there's anyone else that you want to nominate, you can.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : And your wife can also request an advance pad of $10,000 to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses that you might have.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's good idea.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Yeah, of course. Especially, I mean, it can be quite hard on the family during that time to come up with money to pay for a funeral.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : I think it's very expensive to die.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. It is very expensive today. You wouldn't think that it would be right.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : We just had to go through that a few months to go with my grandmother. And it's just it's. Yeah.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : OK it is. Yeah.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : It's, it's crazy, you know, you come into this life and then you, you're leaving and still, you're still paying money to leave.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yes. Hmm.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So it's, it is one of those things though, whether it's Commission or burial, still does cost money.
[4 minutes][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes][Agent] : With that advanced payout though, your wife can request that it's generally paid within one business day receiving the relevant documentation. So you've also got that Peace of Mind as well. And there's a terminally ill advanced payment which is included in the policy.
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So this part of the policy is designed to protect you while you're alive, which simply means the benefit amount is paid to you.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : If you wanted to use that for your medical costs or treatment, you can, but it is up to you how you'd like to use it. OK.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : And we keep it. We do. Yep. No, no, we don't provide medical insurance.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : So, so you can, you can so you can have the medical insurance as well in this policy, OK.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I was just providing an example of how that money could be used.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So if you're diagnosed with a terminal nurse and that was then paid out, an example was that you could use that for your medical costs.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK. So before, before because I suppose you're dying and then you need the money for medical costs, then you can give you that money, correct?
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yes.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Am I right?
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So it's an yes, it's an advanced payout. That's correct.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Advance bail.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So if you are, yes.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : OK. Hmm. Mm. Yeah.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So if you are fully approved for the life insurance, if you're diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we'll pay the claim in full.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : This sounds good.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Well, it is something there. I mean, yeah, I hope that that never happens to you, but it is something there to help you while you're alive.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : They never know a life.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : That's true.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Hey, MM, Hmm.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Life is unpredictable, very unpredictable.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : And do you have the other one as well, like income protection this I suppose, if I'm break my leg? Or do you still have those policy like with my bank has it like a MM? Hmm.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So we do have income protection, however, based on your age, we wouldn't be able to provide it to you.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK. OK.
[6 minutes][Agent] : So it is up to the age of 59, subject to eligibility, but I can see you are already 60 years old.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm 60.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so unfortunately that wouldn't be available based on your age. I do apologise.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's OK.
[6 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : However, we do have life insurance and we do also have funeral insurance as well.
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : OK. So this is including the funeral insurance and life together.
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, what I'm explaining to you at the moment is life insurance, which does include the funeral benefits. That's right.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : MMM so like if I die, so you said you you can get $10,000 from a funeral cost correct?
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : That's correct.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK, So what is the what is the premium would be like weekly Just get the roughly idea, you know?
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yes, Yeah, of course. Let's go into that. Now, we do provide a fortnightly monthly annual premium. So just a quick question about your smoking status.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK yeah.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : And I'm non-smoker.
[7 minutes][Agent] : OK, Good on you. I'm gonna send you a nonsmoker. That's a no for that question there. Right, about the cigarettes. Thank you.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes, no, no, I don't know. I had I had even someone someone smoking near me.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yes, it's not very nice. Well, is it? It's yuck. And so you can choose the benefit amount from $100,000 to 500,000. So what amount would you like me to quote you on?
[7 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : No OK, OK, go for 300 and go for 500. So I just got the both idea. You know how much premium would be?
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, of course. If you don't mind me asking, do you have 300,000 or 500,000 in cover at the moment? OK, alright.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, mine is more, more nearly 600, but but I just wanna cut it.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course.
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : I wanna cut it down because everything is expensive, so it's very hard to.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : And I'm sure like your circumstances have changed as well.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So I've paid a lot of money so far. Yeah. MMM, Secure, yeah.
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : You said that took out you took out the policy when you got your house, but but yeah, but then at the same time, I guess you know your house you said was paid off is what right. Yeah. OK. So 300,000 was the cover is a fortnightly premium of $133.76 per fortnight.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK, 68.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So weekly, it works out to be an approximate figure of $66.88 per week, $66.98 per week is the approximate figure.
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : And then if you would be looking at $500,000 of cover, that fortnightly premium is $216.27.
[8 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So if I divide that by two, there's an approximate figure of $108.14 per week.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[8 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : How do those a month now 158 per fortnight?
[8 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think that's yeah, no, I I'm only paying 158 for my 1, so this is yeah for 600,000. So I think it means that your policy doesn't give me any advantage. You know what I mean?
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK. Well, I understand it is more expensive than what you've currently got in place. You did mention a couple of things were good about the policy being the funeral advance payout and the terminal onus. Is that also something that's including your policy or is your policy only covering you for a death?
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I might have. I don't know, check the fine print. It's been a long time back. Mm. Hmm.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK.
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Maybe. Yeah. OK. MMM.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Because that might be the difference, you know, like that might be a difference within the policy, the benefits that you're covered for, which then may also be the pricing. And also of course, we do pay that policy a very long time ago as well. OK. Is your main concern at the moment looking at the cost? Are you also looking at the benefits about what you're covered for as well?
[9 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. Our benefit is like you know cost is both you know, but cost is very the the product at the moment.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, Alright, well.
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : So I thought I would save some money, but I'm not, but unless I go 300. So I'll I'll check with my bank what this can do for 300. Then probably I can e-mail again. That'll be that'll be we can go again. So we follow up then. But thanks for your Christian all information.
[10 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Thank you of course, of course.
[10 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Alright, OK, sure. Have a good day. Yeah, sure. Yes, e-mail me.

[11 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So we are a New Zealand brand. We're a New Zealand company. We distribute the insurance from Australia, from New Zealand residents.
[11 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Umm, OK. So Australia is the sister company. OK.
