[11 seconds][Customer] : Hello. Please speaking.
[13 seconds][Agent] : Hi, Clay. Good, umm, good morning. It's Terry calling from One Choice. How are you?
[18 seconds][Customer] : I'm good. Thanks. That was fast.
[20 seconds][Agent] : That's good. Yep, we don't like to keep you waiting, that's for sure. So you're looking at your life insurance today, is that right? Yes. Fantastic.
[27 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, umm, basically I'm, I'm wanting cover so that if umm, uh, well, either myself or my partner dies it, it covers half of the mortgage.
[40 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no worries. I'll run you through how everything works, the pricing, options, features and benefits. And if you have any questions as well, I'm here to help. Let me know. I'm definitely happy to do so. Now to start with, I'll confirm your details you've popped through.
[44 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, please.
[55 seconds][Agent] : Can I just get you to confirm please your first and last name and date of birth?
[1 minutes][Customer] : Uh, it's cleared on a he and my date of birth is OS 28th of the 6th 1973. Now, just before we continue, the area that we're in where we live in is really bad for fire etcetera. So often the phone call drops out. If it does, could you call me back?
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Absolutely.
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Right. Thank you.
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : If you, if you drop out, I'll definitely call back on this number. Yeah.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep, great.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. All right, not a problem. I'm just confirming clear that you're a female New Zealand resident as well.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yes. Yep.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : And Please note, all calls are recorded and any advice I provide is limited to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they are suitable for your needs. We do not consider your personal circumstances.
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : All right, so you said you have a mortgage day and you're just wanting cover for yourself. Umm, and then your husband wants cover as well and each of you would be able to pay half the mortgage if anything were to happen to either of you, is that right?
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. So how the quotes work, I'll run you through your information and pricing. Firstly, because we actually, we don't do joint policies here at One Choice, and that's because we do the whole application process over the phone. So that way. Yeah, but you can set it up with the payouts, the beneficiaries, you can nominate your own beneficiaries, you can choose the payment dates, payment level of umm, level of cover and all of that. You can set up how you like, umm, which is be a separate policy. OK, now for the quotes. Claire, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK, cool.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic. And for the range of cover, I'll just pull this up here. Bear with me so we can.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : No, no, it's a little bit more than that.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Is your current annual income $50,000 or more just for the range of cover a little bit more? OK, No worries. So based off that, we can look at a cover amount from 100,000 to 1.5 million. Now I can see you've popped through online wanting to look at the 300,000, is that correct?
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll put you on the 300, but if you want to look at other options, go up and down from there, just let me know. OK, perfect. Now, before we go through the processing, uh, just to let you know, the quotes we run through upfront are only an indication at this stage because there is an application process. Like I mentioned, I just go through health and lifestyle questions over the phone. But once you have gone through the questions, that will determine what the same offer is. So with the final pricing, the features on the policy, umm, at this stage it's just an indication until we've run through the application process.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sure, sure.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So for yourself here, Clay, looking at the 300,000 fortnightly, you've been looking at $26.07 as an indicative quote so that I was $13 per week on the 300K. How does that sound?
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : That sounds good.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yep, perfect. So this also includes a funeral advance payout of 10,000. Do you have a funeral cover at the moment?
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : No. OK, Well, that's automatically attached to the cover anyway. So just that while uh, processing the last claim, when it comes to claims, Tom, the beneficiary can request that the amount of 10,000 will get paid out up front.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Great.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So generally within 24 to 48 hours, umm, from receiving the documents. So that way that cash is available for funeral costs and expenses and upfront cost basically.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Great.
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. All right, Well, if this is sounding so far so good to you. Next step is I'll run you through your application. Questions take about 10 minutes roughly depending on your answers. But once we've run through these ones, I can let you know what the same offer would be.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep. That that'd be good. Yeah.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. I'll also just grab an address because once we have run through everything, if you're happy with the outcome, I'll let you know how we can get your policy documents sent through to run over. Umm, what would your post code be there, please?
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I forget the post code. I can give you the address.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine. I can search the post code with the address if you don't know it off the top. What? What would the address be?
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : It's 289 Pollock Wharf Rd.

[28 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, sure.
[29 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but if you're approved, this policy will cover you suggest due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months plus there's a terminal illness, uh, terminally ill advanced payment attached. If you're diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, we can pay the claim out to you in full. And please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount, so 300,000 or whatever you're covered for, that will increase for you by 5% with associated increases in premium. If you want to, you can opt out of this indexation each year. OK, perfect.
[29 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[29 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So that with the premium, so the premium has risen and like I said, it's due to the power play just for the 300,000 fortnightly that has gone to $78.23, so roughly about 39 per week on the 300,000. How does that sound?

If you're happy with things from there we can activate the cover, umm, get all the policy documents emailed and posted through and you also have a 30 day cooling off. If for whatever reason though, when the underwriter comes back, if you're not happy with the come, we can put a stop to it there and then anyway, OK.
[30 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK, cool.
[30 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : And while your application is being assessed, you will be covered for accidental death, which pays out if death was due to a direct result of an accident, cover under this loss until the insurer makes a decision on your application or 30 days from today, whichever is earlier.

[31 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Should I do this Thursday the 17th or yes. OK, I'll pop that in and your e-mail address. I've got Claire dot dot she. So your last name, did I say that correct?
[31 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Donahey, but that's your hot.
[31 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : thankyou@gmail.com. Is that right? Beautiful. And for the payment method, would you prefer to note in an account number or card number?
[31 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yes, an account number.
[31 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : An account number? OK, so for the account number, we know this one in our system here. And then we confirm the direct debit authority over the phone, so there's no need to sign any forms for that one. Umm, what would the account number be, please?
[31 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : OK, I'll have to get that for you. Hang on.
[32 minutes][Agent] : That's all right. Take your time.
[32 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : OK.

[32 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : It would be 02/04/04 O178O4OO83 clear. Donaghy.
[32 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So just for the direct debit authority, there's a couple questions here. So firstly confirming do you have authority to operate this bank account alone and do not need to jointly authorized debit?
[32 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's true.
[32 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : And have you canceled a direct debit authority for one choice of technical life as the initiator in the last nine months? Are you happy to set up a Direct Debit Authority over the phone without signing a form?
[32 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, No, yes.
[33 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So you agree this Authority is subject to the terms and conditions relating to the bank account provided and the specific Direct Debit terms and conditions that relate to this Authority to authorize your bank to allow Pinnacle Life, who is the initiator for One Choice to direct debit this account in accordance with these terms and conditions. Perfect, thank you. All right, so lastly, I'll just read out a declaration. Once you've agreed to everything, this will be sent to the underwriter. Now when the underwriter comes back, if you're happy with the outcome and all approves and everything, I don't have to read this again.
[33 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yes, sure.
[33 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : I can just hit an accept button once you agree to it so that at least that will be out of the way. Uh, now also one thing, if the underwriter does come back and you're fully accepted with no changes to what we've talked about and discussed, if I just get your voicemail, are you happy for me to leave a voicemail if you want to finalize and record your acceptance now?
[33 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Not a voicemail.
[34 minutes][Agent] : No.
[34 minutes][Customer] : I need to check my voicemail tip.
[34 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that's OK, No worries. Well, thanks for letting me know. I'll make sure I speak to you regardless of what that the outcome is. And lovely.
[34 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, great.
[34 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and also a heads up. Sometimes the underwriter comes back with extra questions. So that may be the case, but hopefully we've put enough information in there for them.
