[1 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm not, I'm, I'm not. I to be honest, I didn't come up with anything. When I when I look at that, I was nothing was pop up and then I was thinking of her.

[1 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Just like a reminder for you. Yeah, fair enough. And so, Molly, do you have like a family? You'd be leaving this to your family or loved ones or children or.

[2 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, fair enough.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : But you know who you'd leave it to? Yes, you'd be leaving your beneficiaries because you can have up to five beneficiaries and they're the ones that receive the money if you pass away.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So you choose who it is, of course. OK. And you know, the money gets paid out in a lump sum to them. So one of these really, it's a series of questions that I ask you about your health and your lifestyle, and that does determine whether or not you're eligible. So we'll have a look at some of those as well.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah, OK.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : And Manny, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Nice. So you can look at the minimum of 100,000. That's the lowest that you can go for. The highest that you can go up to is let's have a look all the way up to $1,000,000. Starting at 100,000 goes up in 50,000, all the way up to 1,000,000. So how much would you like to have a quote on? How much would you need? Yeah.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : I just need to what is the thing, the quotations, anything if I can spend a monthly, if I can spend on my insurance roughly and then for you guys to figure out whether it's necessary, but I'm looking for for 200 to 250 monthly.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK. Alright, let's have a look for you. So we'll start at. Let's see. So you've got to spare on your budget about 200 to 250,000. Oh, sorry, 200, two $150.00. So let's have a look and that's per month. Let's be able to spare. So if we were to look at $600,000 every month, it would be indicatively $203.86 per month. That's for 600,000. OK, let's just have a look to see what the full million is just to see.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's it.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, Just to see what the full. Alright, now that's a bit, that's more, that's why over. That's over 2300.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes][Agent] : Let's see if we were to look at 700,000 per month, it would be $235.62 a month particularly that's for 700,000. And so money like do you have a mortgage or anything like that or?
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : No, at at this time, this is one of my questions. You are. That's why I'm trying to see what is the necessary thing for me because I'm looking to have a, a home mortgage and then this is one of the the requirement.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Right. Yes, Exac, yes, I yes, I was gonna, I was gonna say sometimes that can happen.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, but they may require that for you. So what do you think? Do you think 700,000? I mean that's under 250 a month or do you want to look at a bit more or you want to look at a bit less? How much do you think would be good for you?
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : I'm yeah, the one, the seven it will be fine.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : But because of the I need to to, I haven't, to be honest, I'm not working out. I haven't worked it out for how much if I do a a a mortgage and how much is it cost?
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK, mortgage free. Go get a mortgage.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : So I just need a a for me to work it out now before I do my, my, my, my mortgage so that I can so that I can to the the scenario for the markets.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, if you go in for an appointment, at least you're armed with all the information you need and at least you, you know, you you have what you need. And so that's the thing, though, about better mortgage. And do they require you to have a life insurance to have one in place? Yeah. Yeah, I thought so.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, most of them they are require the just I think that's what they pay or whatever they they are security things.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I thought so. Well, if we sit at the 700,000, we can have a look at that for now. I mean, the next step is to go through the application questions with you to see what your eligibility is. Because even though, you know, we give you a price in the beginning, it's not really set in stone. You know, it doesn't really, it's not the actual outcome yet because you have to go through the application questions just to see what your actual eligibility is.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, there's no worries.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK and and that will give you a bit of a firmer idea on what direction to move forward.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. Yeah, that is it, yeah.
