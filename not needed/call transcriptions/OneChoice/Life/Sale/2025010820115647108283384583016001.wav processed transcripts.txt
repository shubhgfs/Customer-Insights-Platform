[25 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, so it, it is scuba dive, it's not snorkeling, it's scuba diving.
[25 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Oh, sorry. No, no.
[25 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : It's, it's OK. We're getting confused.
[25 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah, I'm getting infused. Yeah. We're in a bed of a rat.
[25 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Let me clarify it. Umm, so again, if it's scuba diving, then we'll note it down here, but if it's snorkeling, umm, only limited to snorkeling, we consider that as different to scuba diving all together. So yeah. So I'll just reconfirm for you with scuba diving, which is that'll be a yes or a no. All good. Uh, Motorsports excluding recreational travel, bike riding, yes or no. And then other hazardous is useful sports. Yes or no?
[25 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, no, no, no.
[25 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : We will answer yes. It is just to jot down the scuba diving. So then it just asks what pursues or sports are you engaged in.
[25 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah, yeah.
[25 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So I'll knock down smoking. Was there anything that there's nothing else you need to drop down here?
[25 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : So it Nah, it's pretty much all I do.
[25 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Not a way at all.
[25 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : I and then that's not even that all.
[26 minutes][Agent] : Yeah, exactly right. I've done snorkeling that many times. It's incredible. I love snorkeling. Just being here.
[26 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : I didn't realise the first time, mate. Like like just seeing actual under the water.
[26 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. It's like another world, honestly. It's like another world underneath you, which you don't even notice. As soon as you got the stalkers on, you can stay down there as long as you want and then get to see how many different things.
[26 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, far you should have seen it in you should have seen it in Have you ever heard of Royal Porky?
[26 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : I haven't. No.
[26 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Far out? If you ever go free diving there far out, that's a that's a psycho.
[26 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Something different. Hey.
[26 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : You're like you get like on the ship day. It's like 25 meters plus vision.
[26 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Wow. And that's on a bad day.
[26 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : It's pretty wicked. Yeah, right.
[26 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Wow.
[26 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : There was like and like the the powers they're like stacked on top of each other because it's quite a that's like what do you call it? It's like multi lens.
[26 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[26 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : It's quite cool.
[26 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Amazing. It gives us something to look forward to. I'm about to go on a cruise. I'm about to go to Queensland from the Great Barrier Reef. OK.
[27 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Oh, cool.
[27 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : It's not green. Yeah. Yeah, that would be crazy. I mean, bit different these days. So I'm taking a look at some photos and the race. Not as nice as it used to be, which is a bit unfortunate, but I'm still looking forward to it. It'll be good.
[27 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Hard yeah, that'd be awesome. Bye.
[27 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah sure I'm looking forward to it.
[27 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Hard Yeah.
[27 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Umm, no. I've just been double checking our list because we've got a list of pre approved things and if it's not on the list we actually need to know if there's a bit more information on it. Snorkeling isn't 1 on the list.
[27 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah.
[27 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Got so many different ones. Snorkeling isn't 1. So I just need to ask a couple of questions if you don't mind. Umm, so just ask. Please provide details for each sport activity. So it's snorkeling. Umm, and that's for a form of fishing. Would it be? Would you consider fishing? It's a bit different, isn't it?
[27 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, 'cause there's like spearfishing, which I definitely don't do.
[28 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I could just say catching, Catching what you catch. Umm.
[28 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that would be yeah, power.
[28 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Just shut that down just so it's clear.
[28 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah.
[28 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : And then how many times per animal hours per week do you participate in these sport activities? So how often do you think you would go?
[28 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : The whole once every couple months.
[28 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Oh, yeah, yeah. All good.
[28 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : You know what? Specially the bluff Weaver, bro, she's no good.
[28 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's it.
[28 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : It'd be different if it was hot all year round.
[28 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, for sure. If only that was the case.
[28 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Probably once a week, yeah.
[28 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : I have everything our way, unfortunately now it's. What licence or certification do you hold? Is there any? You don't have a licence or certification for snorkelling to do. One on this thing, geographical location of activity, is it solely in New Zealand or? Yeah, OK.
[29 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Nah, the snorkelling, yeah, just in Bluff, where I always go, yeah.
[29 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : And all located in New Zealand only, by the way. All good. That comes to the end of the question then. I just want to thank you very much for your patience and the time you took out your day to go through that. I want to praise you. First of all, you're very, very helpful for yourself. You must be taking great care in terms for your application. It needs to be referred to the under out of for further assessment, but it's in regards to snorkeling. Again, if I don't have it on the list, I need to record a bit more further information, but I didn't want to take that away from how could you take care of yourself? You've answered no for essentially all of of those questions, but they'll just have a quick review over the snorkeling. They'll see again. We've shut it down. You do it once every couple of months only in New Zealand only. And then they're going to bring us and now come back very shortly. But the great news is the heavy lifting done. We finish all those lifestyle questions.
[30 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Hi, Hi, hi.
[30 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So what I just want to do is take a moment to explain to you in a bit more detail on exactly what's going to come included as part of your life insurance. All approved, umm, because if approved, once the policy does commence, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause. Just accept the suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[30 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[30 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So that's where we're going to pay the entire lump sum directly to your family. Understanding the reason you're looking to take out the cover. You have your partner, you have two young children, you've got the mortgage you're wanting to cover up again with the funds available for them. They can use these funds for whatever they need moving forward from there. Umm, and then is a terminally ill advanced payment included with your policy. This is a living component and it's if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner who will pay the entire lump sum to you. And that's designed to help you with the medical expenses, ensuring you're getting the best care possible as well. And then as I mentioned, at the time of your passing, your family will also be able to request that advance payout of $10,000. That is there to help with more of those immediate expenses, such as the funeral cost, unpaid bills, those kind of things.
[31 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, cool.
[31 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Uh, now with the cover, so please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each share. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each of your benefit amounts will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. However, you can opt out of this indexation each share umm, so once again the application needs to be referred to the insurer for them to further assess in terms of the premium.
[32 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : 3.
[31 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So far, there hasn't been any changes as of yet or any changes made, but we just need to get that final outcome back from the underwriter as well in relation to the snorkeling umm. So once we've got an outcome back, if it is all approved, we can get that policy all immediately started from there because I'll let you know what the next steps are from here, even though it needs to be referred to the insurer. I will complete the whole process with you now and what that looks like is we'll line that up through a preferred payment method. I'll read your final declaration, but this isn't doing this is. Then once we have that final outcome back, if it comes back fully approved, no changes in any way, I can actually go ahead and accept that on your behalf and then we'll send you out all your policy information to both your e-mail address and in writing to your home address as well. Now as part of this, while your application is being assessed, you will be covered for accidental death, which pays out if death was due to a direct result of an accident. Cover under this loss until the insurer makes a decision on your application for 30 days from today, whichever is earlier.
[33 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : 3.
[33 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : And just to double check with you. So the commencement of your cover, it is going to be subject to a final assessment by the insurer. So if the insurer comes back and they fully approve your application that I'm on without any changes in any way, shape or form, are you happy for me to accept this policy on your behalf and record your acceptance of the policy? Now and then we'll send you out all your policy information to your e-mail and your postal address.
[33 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : You right?
[33 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : But that's not a worry. So with fun as in that one, umm, again, I'll record your address so we know where to get the document sent. Oh, actually, I've got it already. It's 26 while place in Kingswell in the cargo 9812.
[33 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's the one.
[33 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Good. And that's the same as your postal address as well.
[33 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[33 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Do you receive them your mail there? OK, not to worry now with lining this one up today, you are not going to need to make any payments straight away. If you want to keep this in line with say a pay cycle or if you have a preferred day at all, I'll help you with that. Now when works best for you, when would you want the first payment to be? Not to worry with doing it today.
[34 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : It could possibly be today, 'cause it I get paid, 'cause I get paid fortnightly.
[34 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I see. I see. OK. And is today payday? Happy day isn't it? Love a good payday.
[34 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's, it's either, Yeah, it's either today or next fortnight on the Thursday, either or.
[34 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : The only thing if we selected today and I don't get the outcome back till tomorrow, I have to change it. I believe I will be getting but based on all the ones I've sent through in the past, I'll generally be getting it back today so I can select it for today. But again, if it does come back tomorrow or another day for any reason, I'll call you back to then work out. Or if it doesn't come back today, are you happy for it to be on the next pay cycle in a fortnight?
[35 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. No, well, they either all. Yeah, not to worry.
[35 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Alright, yeah, two ways in all good. Well, I'll select the 9th for now then. And then again, if anything changes, I'll just change it to the next fortnight. But if I got the I'll come back today all approved. We'll get it in place and then the first payment date will be 9th of January 2025. And then every fortnight on the Thursday for you. OK.
[35 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Sweet, sweet. And that would just be if, if all goes well, it'll be $48 there.
[35 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : $48.07 per fortnight. That's right.
[35 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Sweet.
[35 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : If there's any changes with the premium, I will get in contact with you and talk to you first before I get anything in place and get your approval of it if there was to be any changes, just so you know.
[35 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, hey, I for I forgot to mention, but do I have to tell you is that I've got health insurance?
[35 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : No, that's fine. Just double check. It makes you feel a little bit better. But no, that's fine.
[35 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Hi, hi.
[35 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : It doesn't impact anything too easy, uh, lining this one up for you so we can line this through either a direct debit using an account number or through a Visa or a MasterCard.
[36 minutes][Customer] : So it is just just would either by pretty easy.
[36 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : All would work better for you, yeah.
[36 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : We'll just go 'cause they'll be yous will be taking the money out out of the camp.
[36 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : It's designed to keep it as simple and easy for you, where you line it up with an account that you prefer, choose the day you'd like it to come out. So then we handle everything, and then it's just automatically debited from that account you've chosen from on the day that you've chosen. Yeah, it's whatever is preferable. If you want to do it the direct debit, I just need to drop down the account number for you. If you need a moment to grab that off, please take as much time as you need.
[36 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : I so I just have to give you my right yes, so it is yeah, it's laden answer in here.
[36 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK. Well, that's very convenient. Now everything's on our phones. Yeah.
[36 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Ah, oh, it's pretty good, I think.
[37 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Can't remember the last time I held a wallet.
[37 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : So do you need this?
[37 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[37 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : So do you need the account number or the what's for the account that is coming from the number?
[37 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yes.
[37 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah.
[37 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Well, we'll need the account number from that for that direct debit. Yep. Yep.
[37 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : So that's 0609250903340 900.

[37 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK. And the account name, is that under your full name? Damon Girls.
[37 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[37 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Just some questions I need to ask you in regards for the direct debit, if I can just have a clear yes or no for each place. So do you have authority to operate this bank account alone and do not need to jointly authorize debits? Is that correct?
[38 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[38 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Have you cancelled a direct debit authority for one choice, its pinnacle life as the initiator in the last nine months on the account you are providing? Are you happy to set up a direct debit authority without signing a form?
[38 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No, yes.
[38 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : And you agreed. This authority is subject to the terms and conditions relating to the bank account provided and the specific direct debit terms and conditions that relate to this authority. You authorize your bank to allow Pinnacle Life, who is the initiator for One Choice, to direct debit this accounts in accordance with these terms and conditions. All good.

Would you like any other information now or would you like me to read any parts of the policy documents to you?
[43 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yes, now this now.
[43 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Kind of sorry, I can't accept no. I'm so sorry. Is that a yes or a no for that?
[43 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Oh, oh, sorry, no.
[44 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : We'll get that, umm, now I've sent that off to our insurer for them to further assess. So just to give you the heads up what can happen from here? Again, if it's fully approved, no changes in any way, shape or form, I'll accept that on your behalf and then I'll get the documents all set across. If there's any changes in any way, I'll get in contact with you directly. Umm, now just one last thing just before I let you go because at the start of our call you are asking about funeral cover as well. Now with the life insurance, yes, there is that advance part of the 10,000, but then we also have another insurance with us at one choice. It's a funeral insurance policy if the guaranteed acceptance cover, which means you will not need to answer any more questions, health or lifestyle to apply with the funeral insurance. It offers a cash benefit of up to $30,000, which is also designed to provide the Peace of Mind and the unfortunate case that you passed away. We pay that money to your family to be able to help with more of those immediate expenses like funeral calls, unpaid bills, claims paid quickly, usually within one business day of completed documents being received. And it would be paid on top and beyond of the life insurance as well in terms of the advance pay and the lump sum. So it's another option that we have available with one choice as well. Did you want me to bring up the quote for you for the funeral insurance that I'm on?
[45 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : You why not?
[45 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : All right, we'll have a look into it and then just let me know your thoughts on it all. Have you ever taken a look into a funeral cover before? Would this be your first time?
[45 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : It'd be my first time bit younger.
[45 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, what was that?
[45 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : They they're like, but I feel a bit young to be doing that like getting all the covers in it. See, it's my first time.
[45 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, I understand it's 100% up to you it it really is. I understand you are still very young. We're actually one month apart. Literally I'm 5th of August, you're the 6th of September. So we're so so close in age.
[46 minutes][Customer] : Oh, wicked. But do you? Do you? Do you have it?
[45 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So I can 100% unders umm, I can 100% understand.
[46 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Ah, no, that's where it is.
[46 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : I'm actually not even allowed to stay if I do or not because I can't say anything like could be saying saying like influences.
[46 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Oh Nah, all good.
[46 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So I'm sorry, can't it, uh, just out of the rules, but I'll give you a rundown. Just let me know your thoughts on it because I, I know the original reason that you're looking into this is you're thinking of your family. There's insurance with the funeral cover. So ultimately designed to look after that, the unfortunate case that you passed away. Umm, we'll provide you with a beneficiaries form. Whoever you nominate is who receives the money and then with the funds available. It doesn't need to be used specifically just for funeral expenses, only if there's other expenses like unpaid bills that need immediate covering or the loans. The money can be used in any way your family see best fit with because again, keeping in mind claims paid quickly with the funeral insurance usually within one business day of completed documents being received. Umm, and then there's also ways that we can triple the amount you're comfort for. So the first way is if death was due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple. So say for example, you covered for 10,000 touch would've never happened. So you passed away due to an accident. The 10,000 triple to 30,000. That is how much will be paying to your partner at that point.
[47 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[47 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, There's also cover for you within it. So there's a way that we can triple the amount to pay to you and it's if you were to suffer an accidental serious injury such as quadriplegia or paraplegia before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday will triple the amount to pay it directly to you. Again, that is a living benefit included with the cover, umm, with applying for the insurance. Very simple and easy for you to do. No medical checks required as I mentioned, so there won't be any more questions you have to answer or forms that need to be filled out to apply. Just so you do know, Damon, as we don't do any medical checks for the 1st 12 months, you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. And then after the first 12 months, that's where you'll be covered for deaths that shoot you any 'cause there, OK.
[48 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[48 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : And then there's one other living benefit included. So in addition, there is a terminal illness benefits, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness this 12 months or less to live by, a medical practitioner will pay the entire claim. It's designed to help with medical expenses, other expenses you may have at the time. So that all comes included as part of the fuel cover. So if we take a look at this one, we can offer you cover from a minimum of $3000 to a maximum of $30,000 and then there's $1000 increments in between. So for example, minimums 3 makes it up 4-5 all the way up to 30,000. What amounts do you feel like would be best to be covered for under the funeral insurance?
[49 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I don't know, maybe 15. Oh, it's near.
[49 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK, let me bring that one up.
[49 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : I wouldn't have.
[49 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Just let me know your thoughts on that.
[49 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : I wouldn't have a pretty old privateer funeral.
[49 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I got some information on it that I'll share with you just so you have an understanding, because research has shown that the average cost of a standard burial funeral service in New Zealand is $11,000. Well, the average cost of a suddenly cremation in New Zealand is 7 and a half, $1000.
[49 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[49 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[49 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Well, we'll probably do the first thing then, OK?
[49 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : If we look, if we do have a look at the 15,000 and then in case of accidental gas trippers to 45,000, that would be a fortnightly premium of $13, one $313.96 per fortnight, so quite $6.98 per week. That's leaving that additional 15,000 for the funeral cover side. How does that sound to you?
[50 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it is good.
[50 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : All good with the premium structure of that covers. So your premiums are level, which means they are designed to stay consistent year on year. Hopefully they'll help you budget those kind of things as the years go by because again, your premiums are level and then there's going to be a couple of options for you at the age of 85. Now, I understand you're still very, very young.
[50 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Hey.
[50 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : You've got a lot of birthdays to celebrate, but a lot of life to live before we're thinking about the age of 85, I understand, but umm still need to let you know. Once you reach the age of 85, your premiums are going to cease, which means you no longer need to pay any more money beyond that point. The funeral insurance continues. What we also do is we add an extra 25% of bonus cover automatically to the amount that you're covered for.
[51 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[51 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : The other option you have is what's called an early cash out option, which means that anytime after you reach 85 years of age, you may choose to end your cover. We will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. So you paid in one lump sum suit if you nominate that option. OK.
[51 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[51 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : So I understand you're happy with the $15,000 benefits in that regards with the cover being guaranteed acceptance for the funeral insurance, there's the ability for you to get this policy organized in the same phone call right now. It's very simple and easy to do. We'll just need to do the same process of lining that up through a preferred payment method, reading a declaration as all completed from there, umm, now then you'll also receive your own set of policy documents for the funeral insurance side. That'll be sent to your e-mail and sent to your home address as well. Gives you a chance to sit down, have a read over that. And then there will be the beneficiaries form. We'll just have you fill out for the beneficiary for the funeral insurance, so we know who to leave those funds to as well. OK.
[51 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[52 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : I just need to let you know as well. So you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. Please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back unless you are eligible for and she's the early cash back offer. The reason I mentioned the 30 days, this policy does give you a 30 day cooling off. So if you decide the policy is no longer suitable for you and you cancel the policy within the 30 days you will receive a full refund of your premium. Just unless the claim has been made. OK, now lining this one up, get to select the first payment date as well. Did you want to have it all on the same day as we have your life insurance? Who started the first payment date today or did you want it like alternating weeks? When would you want the first payment today?
[52 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. We'll just start the same day.
[53 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : All good.
[53 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : And that's the last one.
[53 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So I'll have the first payment selected for the night then if that's OK?
[53 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[53 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Too easy. So it'll be the 9th of January 2025 every fortnight on the Thursday. Now I would just need to record the account number one last time, if that's OK, as soon as you provide any details for your security goes all encrypted. Did you want to use the same account as well the direct debit? All right, I will just need to record that account number one last time. If no need a moment again, take as much time as paid.
[53 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yeah, I got it up here now.
[53 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Very prepared. Thank you. Yep, thank you. Thank you. And then with the account that end up was under Damon Giles, that's correct.

[54 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : No, sorry. What was that again?
