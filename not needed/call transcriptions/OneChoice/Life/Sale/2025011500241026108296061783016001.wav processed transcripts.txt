[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : No, this is the first time.
[3 minutes][Agent] : First time? OK, no worries. And was there anything in particular that sparked your interest into having a look at it with us today?
[3 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I've got a mortgage, so just in case something happens to me, just wanted my mortgage to be paid for.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah. Nice. Awesome. Is that a recent thing that you've, uh, bought the house?
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I bought 3 years ago. I've just come round to thinking about life and former.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, OK, yeah, yeah, sure. That's fair enough. Uh, well, with our life insurance, it's designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. So yeah, you could definitely, you could definitely go towards, uh, maintaining the lifestyle of your family by helping them pay up a mortgage, loans and any other involved in raising a family. So basically it's there to give you the Peace of Mind that if something happened to you, then your family would have that financial security.
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : You can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this benefit amount and what they can also do at the time of claim is request an advance payout of $10,000 from the full amount to help with any funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. UMM, There is also a terminally ill advanced payout built into the as well, so it's a very straightforward cover. Again, you've got the UMM, the, the death benefit, the advance payout for funeral expenses and the terminal illness benefit as well. Did you have any questions about any of that so far? No. OK, perfect. And we do keep everything nice and simple for you as everything is all done over the phone. So there's no forms to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete. We simply take you through health and lifestyle questions as this would take the pricing and terms of the policy for you as well. Just a couple questions. First of all, uh, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yep, perfect. And is your current annual income $50,000 or more before tax? Yep, perfect. And the And that that means I can quote you on an amount between $100,000 up to $2,000,000. How covered did you need for the life benefit?
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it's no, no, yes 600,000.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yep, no worries. Let me look that up for you. And you mentioned that you were after trauma cover as well.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. So without serious illness cover, it pays a lump sum benefit if you were to suffer an insured event covered under the sea. So the insured events are heart attack, cancer, stroke or if you were to undergo coronary bypass surgery. Each of these events are defined within the policy and each claim is assessed against these definitions. Umm, you can, you can apply for coverage anywhere from $50,000 up to the lesser of $500,000 or 50% of your chosen life insurance benefit. So to simplify that, umm, I can quote you from 50,000 up to $300,000 based on the life cover amount that we're looking at at the moment. Uh, how much did you want to take a look at today?
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Probably 300,000 300 the north, is it the maximum?
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : S Sorry, what was that 300 I based on the $600,000 of life insurance, Yes.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK, that's fine.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So sorry. The phone is still a bit muffy. I'm terribly sorry. So you said 300,000 for the trauma cover as well.
[6 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Sure. No worries. Umm, and yeah, we just call, we call our, our trauma covers its illness. Umm, but yeah, it's, yeah.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : So that.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So that's, that's our trauma benefit there. Umm, there are exclusions on the policy as well. So any insured events that become apparent before or during the first three months of the serious illness option commencing will not be covered. Full details of all exclusions are set out in your policy document. And please also be aware. Yeah, sure.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, can't give me sorry.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Sorry.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Just repeat. Could you just repeat that part again?
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. So I just said that any insured events, so you know, heart attack, cancer, stroke or coronary bypass surgery that become apparent before or during the first three months of the serious illness option commencing will not be covered. So if you get a heart attack within or before the 1st 3 months of having a serious illness cover in place, then we won't be able to cover it in that instance. For details of all exclusions are set out in your policy document as well. Yep.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Umm. And also be aware that any payment made under Serious Illness cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount. And if you also purchase Total and Permanent Disability cover, the TPD benefit amount will also reduce when you have a successful serious illness claim. So are you happy for me to add this optional cover to your quote you're looking at? Oh, sorry, I should probably give you the price first. Sorry. So the, so the $600,000 of life insurance cover comes in at an at an cost of $27.02 a fortnight. And then if you add on the $300,000 of serious illness cover, that would be an additional $35.08 a fortnight. So altogether you're looking at a payment of $62.10 a fortnight. How is that sounding for you?
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And are you happy for me to keep that optional serious illness cover on your quote?
[8 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And did you want me to show you any other amounts before we go through the health questions?
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : No, that's fine.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Oh OK, perfect. So I'll just need to reach you at a pre underwriting disclosure statement before we go through the health questions. So it says here. Please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes. We collect your personal information to provide insurance quotes, issue cover and other related services. We will share this with your insurer and may share it with other service providers for the purpose of administering your policy or handling claims. Our privacy policy tells you more, including how to access and correct your information and lodge complaints about breaches of privacy. I also need to inform you about your duty of disclosure before you enter into a life insurance contract, you have a legal duty to provide to us any information you know or could reasonably be expected to know, which may affect our decision to insure you, and on what terms. You need to tell us things that we already know or should know as an insurer or which reduces of the risk we insure you have this duty until the time we enter into the contract. If you fail to disclose the matter or you make a false statement in answer to our questions, we may be able to decline a claim and post new conditions on your policy or avoid your policy entirely. Do you understand this? Perfect, thank you for that. So most of these questions are gonna be yes or no's. I'll go through each one one by one and I'll read out the full questions before I gain your answer. So the first question says here, are you a citizen or permanent resident of New Zealand or a citizen of Australia currently residing in New Zealand? Yes or no?
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[10 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. And the next part is in regards to your medical history. So it says have you ever had symptoms of being diagnosed with or treated for or intend to seek medical advice for any of the following? The first part is stroke or heart conditions such as the not limited palpitations, heart murmur, heart attack and angina. Uh, yes or no? Sorry.
[10 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : I'm just trying to think about that question.
[10 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Mm Hmm.
[11 minutes][Customer] : I haven't had anything to do with my angina heart, heart palpitations could could be related to anxiety. Yeah, but I it's a bit of a grey question, that one.
[11 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, if you've had Hal palpitations and we would put a yes if that helps.
[11 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[11 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So so for that question there. So again, it says S stroke or heart conditions such as but not limited to palpitations, heart murmur, heart attack and angina. So would that be a yes or a no? I'm sorry, a no.
[11 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : I think that would be a no 'cause it's not, I haven't had an that would be a no because I haven't had any heart conditions yet.
[11 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK. Have you had symptoms of any heart conditions?
[11 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : But you know, you're you know, I haven't had any symptoms of any heart conditions, but in again, I have gone to the doctor for health palpitations because due to anxiety, but I have had a check done and it's there. There hasn't been any findings. Does that make sense?
[12 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, MMM OK, So, OK, so if you had symptoms of palpitations then 'cause remember it says, have you ever had symptoms of being diagnosed with or treated for or intend to seek medical advice for any of the following? So if you've had symptoms of palpitations, then that would be a yes. So, yeah, but it's up to you because obviously you're gonna, you're gonna like obviously have a better idea than me than, uh, you know, of your medical history.
[12 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah.
[12 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : But I'm just sort of relaying the, the question sort of. Yep, Sorry, go ahead.
[12 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : So I, yeah, sorry, I have gone to the doc, I have gone to the doctors for heart palpitations. I have had checks done for it and it was my heart was fine. So there was, there's no diagnosis as such, but I guess we just put it down as yes, just to be on the safe side because it is on my medical records.
[13 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, just whatever is the correct answer. So it's umm, so like, I understand that you're wanting to disclose it to be on the safe side, and then I definitely do. Thank you for considering that. And you know, uh, trying to do the right thing, but the it's basically whatever the correct answer is. So not so much like, umm, like there's sort of no need to over disclose anything, if that makes sense.
[13 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : I see.
[13 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So if you have had symptoms of yeah, so like for example, right. If like if you didn't know your, we wouldn't be able to accept like, oh, well, you know, I think I'm, you know, 90 kilograms, but, umm, last, that was the last time I checked, but I could be a bit more so on the safe side or just say 120 just to be on the safe side, you know what I mean? Like stuff like that. So, umm, that's obviously like a crude example, but yeah, so there's no need to sort of over disclose anything. We just need to make sure that we're noting down the correct answer. If you're not too sure, then just let me know and I can maybe explain it in a different if there's something that doesn't make sense and then hopefully that might help us get to the correct answer.
[14 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[14 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK.
[14 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : So basically I've gone to the doctor saying that I had some chest pain and palpitations, but then I have had an EG and stuff done and it was pretty much stress related. So it wasn't actually a heart condition, if that makes sense.
[14 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK.
[14 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : That's right.
[14 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : I didn't you so they found that you didn't have a heart condition at and you went yeah, OK, sure. So, OK, so I understand that at the time that you got the ECG done that it may have shown that you didn't have any heart conditions per SE. But if you have had umm, so because palpitations is part of the questions, if you have been diagnosed with palpitations or if you've had symptoms of palpitations, then umm, then we would put a yes.
[15 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah, no. Yeah.
[15 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Well, actually, well, just to confirm as well, was it actual heart palpitations or was it just feeling like your heart is beating too fast?
[15 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Just, you know, yeah. Just feeling like my heart was beating too fast. But I sort of put it down to anxiety. Yeah.
[15 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : But it it actually not being right, right?
[15 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : So when I did the ECG, it was all clear.
[15 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So your heart wasn't right. So your heart wasn't actually beating too fast.
[15 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : That's right.
[15 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : It was just a feeling due to the anxiety, right? OK, so, so so you didn't actually have palpitations, you just sort of felt like you did, but you didn't actually have them.
[15 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : That's right.
[15 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, cool. Alright, awesome. So in that case, I'll put a note to that one for you then. Is that correct?
[15 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[15 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. So on the next part, it says lung disorder excluding asthma, sleep apnea or pneumonia, cancer or leukaemia, excluding skin cancer, anxiety, depression or stress requiring medical treatment or any other mental health disorder. Yep. And in the last 10 years, have you attempted suicide or been hospitalized for a mental health condition? Perfect. And is it sorry, in the last 10 years?
[15 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : No, no, yes, no in the last three, in the last three years, in the last, in the last 10 years.
[16 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So. So it's 2020. So 10 years ago would be 2015, but between I guess between.
[16 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Hospitalized.
[16 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Sorry.
[16 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Hospitalized.
[16 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So the question, it says in the last 10 years have you attempted suicide or been hospitalized for a mental health condition? Mm, Hmm.
[17 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : I have gone to the hospital for anxiety and depression.
[17 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[17 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : I would put yes.
[17 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yep, yes.
[17 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : I would put yes just just to be on the safe side.
[17 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Well, again, we just got to put whatever's correct. So there's N again, there's no need to over disclose or under disclose. Again, we've got to make sure that we're putting the correct answer in. Not, you know, not how do I put this? Yeah, we just need to make sure we have the correct answer. So if yes is the correct answer, we'll put you, we'll put that. But if you're just saying yes for the sake of, you know, being on the safe side, then we wouldn't be able to accept that answer, unfortunately. So we would just need to, yeah, like, yeah, we would need, we would need a, a confident answer to that one. So if there's something that you didn't, uh, that you didn't understand or, or that, you know, if there's a, if there's a definition that you might need or, uh, if there's a Gray area that you need me to explain, then I'm more than happy to do that. But we just need the correct answer. So either a yes or a no. And it does need to be a confident answer as well. So are you able to say confidently yes or no? Or is there something that you're not sure of particularly?
[18 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : So basically hospitalised for yeah, I'm just not understanding that question because I am on anti anxiety medication.
[18 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Mm, hmm, Yep. Mm hmm.
[18 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : I have got depression medication, I have gone to hospital for depression or anxiety.
[18 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Sure, yeah, sure.
[18 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : You know, I think that I had like, can you repeat the question again so I can understand it?
[18 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, sure. May. Sorry, maybe I might be reading it a bit fast. Let me slow it down a bit. So it says in the last 10 years, have you attempted suicide or been hospitalized for a mental health condition? So you haven't been hospitalized for anxiety or depression? So from from my understanding, yeah. Sorry. OK, Yeah. Which to my knowledge is a a mental disorder. Is that correct?
[19 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : No, I think the answer would be I have been admitted for anxiety and the yes.
[19 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, so Or at least it's a mental health condition, Correct. Depression and anxiety. OK, so if you've been hospitalized for depression and anxiety, and depression and anxiety is a mental health condition. Then that would be a yes, because the company says, well, it provided that it's happened in the last 10 years.
[19 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[20 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So basically if you've attempted suicide in the last 10 years or if you have been hospitalized for a mental health condition in the last 10 years, then we would put a yes. So if you've been hospitalized for depression and anxiety, again, that being a mental health condition and it's in the last 10 years, then we would put a yes to the question. If not, then we'll put in. So is that a yes or a no?
[20 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : I I can put this.
[20 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, it's a yes. Is that correct? Yep.
[20 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yeah.
[20 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Alright, awesome. And it says is your condition a form of schizophrenia, bipolar or psychotic disorder? Nope. OK, that's good. And and then it says is your condition. And then there's four options here. I'm just gonna read out each one in full. So it says, uh, so option A is option anxiety, post Natal depression or stress, including post traumatic stress disorder. Option B is anorexia, universal or bulimia. Option C is ADHD or ADD, and option B is other mental illness not listed here. So is your condition ABC or D? Oh, that's OK.
[21 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : I did get misdiagnosed for ADHD but I but I don't have that. I don't I don't take that medication anymore.
[21 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So you don't actually have it, right? So you don't. So you don't have ADHD.
[21 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : It was a misdiagnosis, no?
[21 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So we'll focus more on the ones that you do have. So is your condition ABC or D? So this is referring to the to the ones that are that are there.
[22 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : It's not AB was a misdiagnosis so I think it would be C. Oh OK. No, not.
[22 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : C is ADHD or ADD, so option A is option A is depression, anxiety, post Natal depression, or stress including post traumatic stress disorder. Option B is anorexia nervosa or bulimia, Option C is ADHD or ADD, and option D is other mental illness not listed here.
[22 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : It's A.
[22 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries for the next part. Just to make things easier, hopefully I'll give you the definition because it uses the word episode. But I just want to give you the definition just because sometimes what people might think we mean by an episode might be different to what it is. So just give me a second. OK. So an episode is an event, occurrence or recurrence of symptoms with increased severity from mood and usually require either medical intervention, referral, treatment or alteration or adjustment to existing maintenance treatment. Treatment can take the form of medication and or counseling or therapy. So if someone has mental health symptoms that require treatment, this is an episode and if they return to the doctor several times to monitor the situation and also repeat prescriptions, this is the this is the same single episode. If however, they have a relapse or symptoms worsen and to be changed or increased and this constitutes a second episode. Similarly, if the applicant recovers and treatment stops and the applicant is fine, but at a later date, symptoms return and they have to go back to the to the doctor to seek further advice. This would be a separate episode. So how many episodes have you had which required treatment? Would it would it be 1 to 2/3 to 4/5 to six or seven plus?
[24 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Probably the ticky 1. It's a ticky 1 because this is over the last 10 years, isn't it?
[24 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Oh, this is Emma. Sorry, sorry.
[24 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Ah yes, 7 plus 7 plus.
[24 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : I just 7 plus. OK, sure. No worries. Yep.
[24 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Probably 7/7 plus.
[24 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK. And it says have you ever seriously contemplated or attempted suicide?
[24 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : MMM Contemplated or attempted?
[25 minutes][Agent] : Yes, seriously contemplated.
[25 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : No.
[25 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Alright, awesome. OK, so it says here OK, so it asks typically how many episodes have you had?
[25 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Episodes in terms of 07 plus right that we covered that question.
[25 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Is there's just some parts here that we've got to type in now Mental health, yes. So now it's because of the, so basically the stage that we're up to now based on the way that you've answered the questions it's asking for more detail. So this is an option is more so parts that I can now type in. So the first box that it's asking me to type up is for how many episodes you've had, OK.
[26 minutes][Customer] : I can't really, I can't really put a number on it, to be honest, because, because for the last, I don't know, I guess 20 to 30 years.
[26 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : MMM, mm, hmm. Sure.
[26 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : I've always have gone back and forth to the doctor for, you know, either changing medication or increasing the dose or decreasing the dose or, you know, so I I, I would say at least two to three, 2 * a year if we average it out over 10 years.
[26 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Right. But remember, if if you return, so if you need a return. So if you return to your doctor several times to monitor the situation and all repeat prescriptions, it's classified as the same episode.
[26 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. OK. Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah, yeah. OK. So in in that case.
[26 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So, yeah, yeah, it's just more so, so when it, when it constitutes a second episode is if you have a relapse or symptoms worsen, uh, and treatment needs to be changed or increased because of that, then that would be a second episode.
[27 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[27 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but if, uh, if you, and, and also if you do recover, like let's say that you recover completely and, and the treatment stops and, and then you're fine. And then you umm, and then at a later date you've returned to the doctor to seek further advice from mental health. Then that would be a separate episode. Hmm, OK. For the same episode of the different. Yep.
[27 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : I guess if we sort of balance it out over the last 1516, over the last 20 years, and if I sort of say on an average I've gone to the doctor twice a year, depression and anxiety, yeah, fine.
[27 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : But is it for the same episode of depression and anxiety or is it for a different instance of that? Yeah, yeah, I understand that might be for the same condition, but is it for the same like, like is it like, you know, you, you see the doctor the first time you get better and then another time in the year you see the doctor again?
[27 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, pretty much depression and anxiety, but the medication has changed along the way, but it's for the same condition.
[28 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So, OK, so for example, right, let's say that let's say for example, that I went to the doctor and then I I was diagn and then I'm diagnosed with depression and given some medication. If, if I'm, then, if I, then, if I, if I'm taking medication, which helps the symptoms and then later on in the year I see the doctor, umm, to, you know, get either a repeat prescription, umm, of my current dosage or, you know, if he's, uh, you know, just adjusting it because he sees that there's been an improvement, umm, or for whatever reason, other than like my symptoms worsening, of course, umm, then that would still be the same episode of depression, right? But if, for example, I was diagnosed with depression, I, I was got put on medication, I tape it off the medication and then I, you know, I've, I've been fine. And then later on in the year, I was to get depression again and then get put back on some medication, for example. That would be a separate episode to the first instance of depression.
[29 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I see.
[29 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[29 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I see. OK, so that was sort of for me, I guess. OK, if you put it that way.
[30 minutes][Agent] : If you're not sure, umm, look what we could get you to do is have a chat to your doctor about it and see if they can have a look to your medical records to discern how uh, exactly how many there there is. Umm, and then also whilst you're there as well, umm, because the next questions regarding that would just be, you know, if you've had symptoms or treatment for this condition within the last six months, which I'm sure you may know, umm, also the name and the daily dosage of the medication you're taking, which I'm sure that you know as well. Umm, and then and, and then if you've ever been hospitalized or treated as an inpatient, and then if so, just the the date and length of your stay and this and advising us as well of the circumstances surrounding the state. So those are all the questions that I've got here for the mental health. Yeah, sorry. Yep.
[30 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : I yeah, so, so for me, so for the mental health, I think it would only be 1 episode because it's the anxiety and depression. So I've kind of gone back to the doctor, increased, decreased, gone back to the doc doctor changed the medication, but it's for the same, it's for the same condition, which is anxiety and depression. So I guess it would be plastered 1 episode having gone back and forth to the doctor, I in a changing dose, increasing, decreasing doses.
[31 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[31 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So I guess it would be classed. I don't think the symptoms worsened.
[31 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : But just letting you know as well that if the if the if the symptoms worsen, which means that if if your symptoms had worsened, which was the reason why the treatment needs to be changed or increased, then that would constitute a separate episode, right? OK, OK, sure. Right. OK, So, OK, so just going back here, it says how many episodes have you had which required treatments? Would that, so would that would that be 1:00 to 2:00?
[31 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : I just think it was a matter of finding the right kind of medication that worked one to two. Yeah.
[32 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[32 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : And I've changed the medication, yeah, for the same symptoms. Yeah.
[32 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : And alright, bye.
[32 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : 1:00 to 2:00.
[32 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : No, no. So if so, it's like it's kind of like what I asked you about the palpitations, right? Like if you thought you had palpitations and then the doctor said, hey, look, you actually don't have palpitations and you don't have any heart conditions or any signs that you had or have palpitations, then we wouldn't need to disclose it.
[32 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : If you want to add the ADHD does do we have to add the misdiagnosed ADHD in there in potentially make that 3 or that's fine. That's fine.
[32 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So if for example, you were told that you had ADHD or ADD and it was a misdiagnosis because you weren't actually displaying any symptoms of that, for example, umm, then we wouldn't need, we wouldn't need to include it.
[33 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK, that's fine.
[33 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So would are we still looking at including it or leave or are we leaving that out? Leave that out. OK, so the next question says, was it more than one episode? For the just the everything mental health related.
[33 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : I'll leave that for the depression and the PTSD Five.
[33 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So because we are, we went through how many episodes have have you had which required treatment, which is 1:00 to 2:00 and then it just says he wasn't more than one episode.
[33 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, I said between 1:00 to 2:00 because it's always been for the same reason.
[33 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, if you're not too sure, like I said, we might need you to check because it's asking if it was more than one episode. So if you're not EE exactly sure, then we might need to get you to check that one. Umm, yeah, you can definitely. Like if you wanted to call your doctor to find out, that's completely fine as well. So do you know if it is more than one or you're not sure? If you're not sure it's fine, but just wanted to get your opinion on that.
[34 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : No, it's OK 'cause I've got all my medical records just recently and I've just gone to see my doctor recently and yeah, a a all I know is that I've gone back and forth to the doctor for depression and anxiety a few times, but it's only been for depression and anxiety. It hasn't been for anything else.
[34 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : I understand.
[34 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : So I would so I would say it would be 1:00 to 2:00.
[34 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, I, I do thank you for letting me know. And I, I do understand that it between 1:00 to 2:00. But the question, I mean, I didn't, I just letting you know so I didn't, I didn't write these questions. So I'm, I'm not too sure, umm, what the exact reason is as to why this is in there, but I'm sure you know how like you know, the actuaries, actuaries that worked on this and whoever it is like, umm, that's worked on this application. I'm sure there's a reason for it, but I'm not too sure what that is. But it's just asking you if it was more than one episode. So if you're not tissue, then we might need to get you to have a chat with your doctor to see if they can discern whether or not it was or it wasn't just because I don't want to sort of make you say the wrong thing or put you in a spot where you, uh, because I know that you've a couple of times you've sort of had the approach of, well, just to be on the safe side, I'll say this. So instead of, uh, you know, getting you to say the wrong thing, umm, and because that can obviously affect, umm, the payout of claims time as well, Umm, and it could also affect like, umm, like we don't, we don't wanna insure you under the wrong terms and you know, and either having, having you pay the wrong amount or, umm, you know, uh, messing things up at claims time and stuff like that. So if you're unsure if it was for the one single episode or if it was actually for more than one, umm, because I understand that this is a, a, something that's been over the course of, you know, of, of, of, uh, 20 to 30 years. Umm, like I said, if you have a chat to your doctor or go through your medical records thoroughly to discern as to whether or not it was more than one episode, I'm more than happy to give you a call back later on today. So you can have a chat with whoever and, you know, look through whatever you need to and all that. But yeah, it's up to you.
[36 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Let's go with two at this stage, Cos I yeah, let's go with two I think, Cos I've thoroughly gone through my local.
[36 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, just OK, sure. So I thank you for letting me know just because there seems to be a lot of uncertainty around that, like because you said, you know, let's go with two. I think it's not really a confident answer. So look what I'm going to do is I do like I said, I don't want to insure you for the wrong thing and for the wrong price and whatever. So I'll, I'll send you out some general information to your e-mail for now. And if you could ask your doctor about it, just, you know, just to make sure that we do have the correct answer for you. And then look, I'll give you a call in a couple hours so that you, you can have, you know, just have a look and, and see E even if you wanna take another look for your medical records and ha and see, OK, look, it was definitely 2 or it was definitely, you know, oh, look, I, I, you know, I realized that I was actually, you know, I'd actually gotten better here. And then, umm, you know, I picked it up again at this point in time. So it's actually 3, whatever it is like, you know, just because I don't like I said, I don't wanna ensure you, it's the wrong thing. Yep.
[37 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : It's just so, so, so, so basically like, you know, I've, I've always been, I've always seen the doctor for depression and anxiety, right?
[37 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[37 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : I've gone to the doctor, they've prescribed me a certain medication and symptoms haven't got better.
[37 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Hmm. Mm.
[37 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : I've gone back, changed medication, gone back, functions have got better. Dec decreased my dose, symptoms have come back. I've gone back, changed medication, increased the dose.
[38 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[38 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So it's been up and down quite a bit over the last 20 years, 1020 years. So I don't know if that's classed as different exercises or if that's classed as one episode for the same condition, if that makes sense.
[38 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, sure. Well, that's yeah, that's the thing. So that's why I like, all I can do is give you the examples and the definitions, but I can't really do any more than that.
[38 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : So my, my, my question to you is if I've gone back to the doctor, say once a year or every second year to decrease or increase the dose or change the dose, are they classed as separate episodes or is it classed as 5 episodes for the same reason?
[38 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : And you know, we yeah, sure, it depends on the depends on the reasoning as to why it's increasing, decreasing is a different story. But if it's no yeah, yeah, I understand that. Like, I understand that the like I so from my understanding, the only mental health conditions you've ever had is depression and anxiety, is that correct?
[38 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : The same SA, same same reason anxiety and depression it would always be Yep, Yep.
[39 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK, Well then yeah, I understand that it's all for the same reason as in like it's all for depression and anxiety. When I say reason, I mean the reason as to why they're changing or increasing the dose of treatment. So I understand obviously that's related to the the depression and anxiety. I get that. But it depends as to what the reason is regarding that, that they're, you know, increasing it or changing the actual money itself. So yeah, I can't answer this for you, unfortunately.
[39 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I I mean, I can answer it for you. I can answer it for you. It's it's mainly because my medication hasn't fixed the symptoms. So I've gone back to change the medication. So a different medication that does work.
[39 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah. OK. Right so at, at this point, so just going back and changing, do one or two episodes. It's uh, now like, because we've changed that I forgot to mention as well, but there's no boxes for me to actually enter in that information. So we're back to the yes or nose for now.
[40 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Bye.
[40 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So there's no way that I can enter in any of that information. So, umm, I couldn't yeah. So it's, it's, it's just yes or yes or nose for now.

And I just, it's not, it doesn't really give me the confidence that, you know, that we're getting the exact correct answer. You know what I mean? And I just I don't wanna answer like.

So if you decide that the policy isn't suitable for you and you apply to cancel within 30 days of your first payment, sorry within thir, within 30 days, sorry of your first payment, then you'll get a full refund of your premium unless a claim has been made. And that'll give you the chance to get all the policy documentation sent out to you by e-mail and post and also have some time to read through it and and make sure that you are happy with everything as well.
