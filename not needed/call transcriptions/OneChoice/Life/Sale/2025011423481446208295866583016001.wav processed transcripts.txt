[1 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : I've got life insurance, but it's back in South Africa. So my plan was to cancel all of that. And because we're residents now, I want to rather have a life insurance policy based in New Zealand. That just makes much more sense than sending money every month back home to keep those policies running.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : MMM, MMM, yeah, yeah, definitely understandable.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : And yeah, you see, yeah, that's correct. That's my main priority, first to get my policy activated in New Zealand, then stop the other ones in South Africa.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Well, with the with the cover, I've just got to mention if you are placing an existing policy, recommend that you do not cancel it until you have reviewed this policy and was it may not be a Yep, no understand. Well, I've just got to mention as it may not be identical to your existing cover, but with the the life insurance, was it more what made you look in taking it out? Were you wanting to cover like a mortgage? Was it for your family?
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Basically, it's basically it's my family. Do you know life is short. I've just lost a friend back in South Africa. It can happen so quick. And I want that Peace of Mind that my family is sorted for the future.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, yes, understandable.

[3 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : You, you.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : So yeah.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : You are definitely right with the life insurance. It's all designed for those reasons. It can help pay off any mortgages or loans or other costs involved in raising a family.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Exactly.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : But they're to give that Peace of Mind. If something happened to you, they'd have that financial security.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : That's that's the main goal.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. With, with the loved ones, you know, specifically who you wanted to leave the money to.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : It's basically will only be to my wife and I've got one son of six years old.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Oh, beautiful. Well, you have you have full control over the list. So if you're wanting to leave it to both of them, you can definitely do that.
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : But you can nominate up to five people to be beneficiaries to receive that benefit amount.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK, that's good.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : We'll also included in the life insurance, we also include an advance payout of $10,000 to help with a funeral costs and those expenses at the time. And umm, there's also a terminally ill advanced payout which God forbid if this were to ever happen.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes, I see.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : But if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, what we do is pay that claim to you in full whilst you're alive to help with any further medical costs or just mainly to ensure you receive that best care possible.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I understand, totally understand.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : No problem, I will.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : That's something good to have, especially if you work on a farm which is very active and your body takes strain and yeah, anything can happen.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, for sure. I mean, you, you can definitely use it for last holiday, but umm, that, that one's also just to ensure you received that best care at the time.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, this is just as a backup.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, but it's nice and simple to apply. We don't require to do like any medical checks or complete any blood tests or anything like that. We just, we just have some yes and no health and lifestyle questions that determine the final pricing. But we'll go through an estimated quote together.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, Yes, OK.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : I've just got to ask, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : I am currently vaping. I did.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : And.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : I was back in South Africa. We've been here 2 years, March will be two years. When we left South Africa, I quit smoking cigarettes and when I landed in New Zealand I started to vape. So I know it's not the one isn't better than the other one, but at least I'm not. Yeah, smoking cigarettes, but I do vape on a daily basis.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, understandable. Well with that just with they, they class of as like an e-cigarrete.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : That's correct. OK.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So just regardless of the type of e-cigarrete we would have to answer yes to this question.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yes, we have to. Definitely.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : But Krista, but like in the future, if you do surpass 12 months of not having a vape, you can always have this status reviewed. You give us a call and we can always have that smoking status reviewed for you.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK, I see. OK.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. I just answer yes to that one. And with your current annual income, do you earn more than $50,000 annually or yearly?
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : But for now it is a yes, yes, yes I do. I'm currently on 75.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, beautiful. Lovely to hear this as well Krista. So you can choose amounts to be insured from from 100,000 being the starting amount and it goes all the way up to $2,000,000 worth of cover.
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK, damn it. OK.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but which amount would you like me to look at first or be a suitable amount you'd like to leave to your family?
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : I was looking at 500 just to start off.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, definitely. So if you're looking at the 500 so far, the estimated indicative price is coming in at $83.24 a fortnight for 500K worth of coverage so far.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : OK, yes, I see.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Lovely.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that'll suit me now probably the best. I mean, that's more than enough. Then I'm currency paying TT in South Africa or where I'll be able to get out should something happen to me. So I'm more than happy with that.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, well, oh, with the with the policy, even if you felt like it was too high of an amount that during the process you can apply it to decrease as well.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : OK, that's good news.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : It has a lot of flexibility with that benefit amount.
[7 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, actually, I know it's tough times in New Zealand. It's tough times. I re read the news and I follow what's going on here and it's it's it's tough, people are struggling.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : But yeah, yeah, D definitely, that's the main thing, making sure it is suitable within their budget side.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : It's flexible, yes.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. I've just wanted to check though, because we have an additional cover that you can add on top of the insurance, but it's more for these insured events. It's for heart attack, cancer, stroke, or if you were to undergo coronary bypass surgery. This additional cover, it's called serious illness cover.
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I see.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Some other insurers may call it like a trauma cover, but it's designed to assist you in any rehabilitation costs or even as an income replacement as you might be recovering.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I see.
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : It's all entirely up to you if you'd like to add it on to the insurance, but it would it'd be something you're interested in looking at as well on top of the life.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Probably, yes. I mean, yeah, we don't get any younger. And I mean, yeah, those serious illnesses become more popular the older you get.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Unfortunately, you're, you're yeah, I'll go through that pricing.
[8 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : But how much will that be extra on the policy, OK.
[8 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So which each of these events are defined within the policy and each claim is assessed against these definitions. You can apply anywhere from $50,000 up to the lesser of 500,000 or 50% of your chosen life insurance benefit.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see for 50,000.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : But to give you an idea of even what the 50,000 would look like, it would then be $24.77 a fortnight on top of the life insurance premium for the 50 years.
[8 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So even for the 500 K 50,000, altogether it's coming in at $108.01 a fortnight so far.
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : OK then my sorry my then my life insurance will be 500 and extra on the policy. What is the amount?
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, what what do I get out I in the 108.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So that one is no.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So for the life insurance so far 500K it's 8324 and the additional serious illness if you had 50,000 you can choose from 50,000 all the way up to 250,000 for this.
[9 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : But the the starting 50K is $24.77 a fortnight. So a a all together 108 and one cent all together as a combined price.
[9 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, yes, yes, I see Let's let's do it. I'm going to close my eyes and do it. There's no value on on the life.
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Understandable.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : So if if you want to add that $24.00 and then it's 50,000 just to start off.
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : That's, that's serious illness. That's all right. We'll leave the the 50K on there for you. I've just got to get your confirmation. And again with any insured events that become apparent before during the first three months of the serious illness commence option. So the serious illness option commence you will not be covered.
[9 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, for any critical emergencies, Yes, Yeah, OK.
[9 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Full details of all exclusions are set out in your policy document. And please also be aware that any payment made under serious illness cover reduces available life insurance benefit amount. If you also purchase total and permanent disability cover, the TPD benefit amount will also reduce when you have a successful serious illness claim.
[10 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[10 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : But it just asked with a yes or no. Are you happy for me to add this optional cover to your quote?
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[10 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : No problem at all. I'll leave that on for you. And what we'll do together is we'll go through those questions. Christa, Essentially it determines the final pricing. It can stay the same or it can change. It's just depending on the application questions.
