[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah. Awesome. Anything in place at the moment?
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : No. OK, that's alright. Well, with our life insurance, what we've designed it to do is to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. So this benefit could be used to help maintain their lifestyle by helping them pay off a mortgage, loans and any other costs involved in raising a family. So basically it's there to give be the Peace of Mind that if something happened to you, then your family would have that financial security. You can choose up to five beneficiaries to receive this benefit amount and what they can also do at the time of claim is request an advance payout of $10,000 from the full amount to help with any funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. And there is also a terminally ill advanced payout included in the cover also. Uh, so we, so we do keep everything nice and simple for you. You know, everything is well done over the phone. There's no forms to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete. We simply take you to your health and lifestyle questions as this will determine the pricing and terms of the policy for you as well. Yep.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Umm, So just before we go through pricing there, I just wanted to also ask, you know, apart from funeral expenses, is there anything in particular that you're looking at covering for your family in the event of your passing?
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I, I have 3 kids. They're adults. I have one son.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, Your kids, they're all adults.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK. Are they dependent on your income at the moment?
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Two of them I, I have a 18 year old and I have a son that's disabled and he's 30 years old.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Two of them, I see 30. Right, Right. OK. Sure.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : So I'm, you know, yeah, he's challenged and he's epileptic, so he's disabled. So I'm, you know, my elder son is working, but my thing is worried about these two. Just something to help them out through life.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, sure. Airport. Sorry.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : I want to pay off my bills, if anything, and to pay off my bills that I have, if any.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, Any leftover bills when you pass away?
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. Yeah, 100%. Well, that's exactly what it's there for, you know, to make sure there's that financial protection, especially, you know, having a disabled son. I can, you know, definitely def definitely sympathize with that and understand where you're coming from there. Well, just a couple of preliminary questions. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yeah, no worries. And I can quote you from $100,000 up to a maximum of $1 million. How much cover do you think you'll need for your kids there? Yeah, sure. So for $500,000 of cover, the indicative cost for that would be $124.26 a fortnight. So again, that's $124.26 a fortnight. However, this, this could be higher for this level of cover depending on the outcome of your health and lifestyle application. Umm, but we can look at something higher or lower for the uh, the benefit amount to make it cheaper or, you know, obviously give you more cover. Umm, so it's up to you.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, probably 5 Hun 500 O OK EV.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Uh, how did you want to look at any other amounts?
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that sounds pretty good. Every two weeks, Every fortnight.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, cool. The 12426 of one night. OK, cool. Well, I'll keep that in mind. And then if the pricing goes up due to your health and lifestyle application and you wanna look at something lower than, you know, it gives me an idea of, uh, how much we need. How much yeah, we need to go in order to, uh, make sure it's suitable there for you, but we'll play it by year anyway. Umm, and you'll also, you do have the option to add an extra benefits to your cover. They do cost extra, but we've got serious illness cover and we've also got, uh, total and permanent disability covers as well. And I'm gonna look at adding in any of those, you know, just the life insurance for now.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : O OK, just the life insurance for now.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK, cool. No worries. OK, so I'll take you through the health and lifestyle questions.
