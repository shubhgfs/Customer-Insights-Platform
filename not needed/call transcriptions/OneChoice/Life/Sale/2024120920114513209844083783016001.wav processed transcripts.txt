Any advice I provide is limited to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they are suitable for your needs. We do not consider your personal circumstances. So Greg, I specialize with the life insurance with us at one choice. So if you have any questions at all, just please do let me know. Uh, but just to get a bit more of a better understanding of your situation, what sparked your interest? What's made you start thinking about life insurance yourself?
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : All my friends are dying.
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : I understand. So sorry to hear that just may just not thinking of your own situation by the sounds of it.
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : I understand and we touch with your family Nevada. I do not need to claim on this insurance for a very, very long time. But in the very unfortunate case you would have passed away. It's really designed to give you that Peace of Mind where we pay the entire lump sum directly to your family to provide financial support to a difficult time. If you wouldn't mind me asking, who do you want to leave the money behind to? Do you have any children or partner? The family that you're thinking of? Yep.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I've got a partner in my son.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : And you have a son as well. Nice. Have they given you any grandkids just yet or is it still young? Oh yeah.
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I've got, I've got 10 grandchildren, my wife and I and my son here.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Oh lovely. It'll be nice to have a little young ones around again, I'm sure.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but I understand well who you're thinking of is you have your partner and you have your son as well. And the reason I ask you a question like that, you will be in complete control on who receives the money at every stage of your life insurance policy. We do provide you with what's called a beneficiary's form. So whoever you then nominate is who's going to be receiving that money directly at that time with the funds available for your family, they will have complete control on how the money is then used. If it's to be covering any loans, if there's any unpaid bills that need covering, even to the immediate expenses like funeral costs, as they can request an advance payout of $10,000 from your life insurance to be able to help with more of those immediate expenses at the time.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, now with applying for the cover, we keep it nice and simple for you. It's done all over the phone. So there's no forms you need to fill out. There's no medical checks you need to complete. It's just yes or no questions, which I'll help you with. Grego, that's designed to, oh, it's determining your final price of your policy and the exact terms of your policy as well. OK, before we go through anything like that though, I'll load up some pricing. Let's work out the best amount for you to be covered for. We'll make sure it's all, all affordable for you as well. I do just have a couple of questions to ask you. Can I confirm?
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I have a few.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Have you had a cigarette?
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I have a few questions myself.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I do. I'll, I'll be happy to answer them for you. What questions do you have?
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Well, umm, the diabetes cancel me out.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Uh, we'll need to go through the questions to determine your eligibility. Umm, but with diabetes, it's a question that we ask for, but I I will explain to you the outcome with it. Do you have other questions?
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I mean, you know, because of diabetes, I all that all that good stuff. But yeah, I was, I was just waiting for Christian meals.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : I've been, I'll tell you now, being turned down before. So. Yeah.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, understand is that for diabetes you can turn down for, we can offer cover for diabetics, but it's dependent on other health and life sales factors. So that's why I don't wanna 100% confirm it with you because there's a number of different questions that I need to go through. But just for diabetes alone, it doesn't just automatically rule you out. Umm, but I will go through the questions with you in a moment and then I can tell you straight away if we can offer cover or if we can't and if we can offer cover on what term? So I'll make sure I'm very transparent and honest with everything you need to know before we get anything in place at correct.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, OK.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, so let's first work out the amount for you to be covered for, uh, because it needs to be an amount that you're comfortable with your family receiving, but it needs to be affordable for you as well. So you can take a look at some amounts. Umm, now I'll just confirm that question again. So have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months or was that a yes or no?
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : No.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, good to hear that. By the way, hope you lost us all choice and in terms of the amount of cover we can offer for you, it ranges from a minimum of $100,000 to a maximum of $500,000. There is a $50,000 increments in between. For example minimum is 100,000, next to that one 5200 all the way up to 500,000. Do you have an idea on what you feel like would be best to leave behind for your partner? For your son?
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Well, well, minimum probably is.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yep, not to worry. If we have a look at insuring you for $100,000, that would bring your premium to $106.37 per fortnight. So it equates to $53.19 per week. That's leaving $100,000 behind for your family. Gregor, in terms for affordability at the moment. How does that sound to you? Sounds affordable. Good to hear. Most certainly needs to be. It is only an indication though.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sounds horrible, Yeah.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Just so you know, I need to go to the questions and confirm the final price with you. So before you go any further, let's go through those now and then we'll confirm your eligibility. OK?
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : No.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so there's a quick paragraph that I need to read to you before we head through the questions and this will let you know what to expect to the questions as well. So it reads. Please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes. We collect your personal information to provide insurance quotes, issue cover and other related services and we'll share this with your insurer and make sure it's with other service providers for the purpose of administering your policy or handling claims.

So before you enter into a life insurance contracts, you have a legal duty to provide to us any information you know or could reasonably be expected to know, which may affect our decision to insure you and in what terms. You do not need to tell us things that we already know or should know as an insurer, which reduces the risk we insure. You have this duty until the time we enter into the contract.
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : None.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : If you fail to disclose the matter or you make a false statement in answer to our questions, we may be able to decline a claim, impose new conditions on your policy, or avoid your policy entirely. So with a clear yes or no, can you please confirm? Do you understand this? OK, So with the questions, very simple health and lifestyle questions, I just require a clear yes or no for each. But if you do need me to clarify anything along the way, just do let me know, OK? Uh, the first question I need to rate Currica is are you a citizen or permanent resident of New Zealand or a citizen of Australia currently residing in New Zealand, yes or no?
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.

[8 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, oh, the doctors were concerned, so, umm, they sent me to the hospital and then they're all clear from the hospital.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, I understand I'm placing you that you got the all clear because that would have been a bit scary, I'm sure.
[9 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, yeah.

[9 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : I went to there for a fever and then they put me on the the concern about my heart and I don't know what the reason was.
[9 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : That's OK.
[9 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : When they seem to, they seem to the hospital. And then, yeah, that was I was just giving all, all clear.
[9 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, right. OK, not a worry. That wouldn't be disclosed to you then. Umm, yeah, I understand that you had your heart checked, but it's not a heart condition that you had. It was just ruling that out pretty much due to the fever. Umm, so we won't need to umm, disclose that here. Was that all correct? What I said it was again, you went to hospital due to the fever. Doctors were worried, umm, they had a look at your heart, everything came back clear. Is that correct?
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : All right, That's correct.
[9 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : All right, yeah, we won't need to disclose back here because it's only asking if it's a heart condition that you have had or have.

So have you ever had symptoms of been diagnosed with or treated for or intend to seek medical advice for any of the following? So for stroke or heart conditions such as but not limited to palpitations, heart murmur, heart attack and angina with that be a yes or no OK, lung disorder excluding asthma, sleep apnea or pneumonia, yes or no? I'm sorry to hear that.
[10 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Also no I've got pneumonia now, just picked it up and I and I've got a three bed.
[10 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK then so with pneumonia and sleep apnea, that's actually also going to be disclosed a little bit low, uh, later on there raising towards that this question, just excluding those, it's excluding sleep apnea and excluding pneumonia. So it's not included with this question there.
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.

[12 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[12 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : You do not need to say yes for it just because of those conditions.
[12 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[12 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Does that make sense there? Does that clarify that? OK.
[12 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[15 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a worry. Well, good, let's move on. Next question, rates. Do you have existing life insurance policies with other life insurance companies with the combined total sum assured of more than $5,000,000? Yes or no OK, next section now it's in relation to medical history, so it rates have you ever had symptoms of been diagnosed with or treated for or intend to seek medical advice for any of the following? First question with this one reads diabetes raise blood sugar, impaired glucose, tolerance for impaired fasting glucose. There'll be a yes for that question.
[16 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[16 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Craig, appreciate you letting me know. So type one or Type 2 diabetes, is that a yes or a no?
[16 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : What's on those? Plug one?
[16 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Type 1?
[16 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : There's no, there's no mention on that.
[16 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Well, type 1 is insulin dependent. Type 2.
[16 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Oh, so plug two, Yeah.
[16 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, just to make sure we're all clear with it, I just want to read you the definition of both. So diabetes mellitus type one, this is also referred to as an insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas order undergoes an autoimmune attack by the body itself and is rendered incapable to make insulin. Type 1 patients must rely on insulin medication for survival and then diabetes more out of type 2. This is an insulin resistant diabetes diagnosed at an adult age that can initially be monitored by exercise and diet. Medications are typically needed as the disease progresses. So umm, for type one or type 2 diabetes, would that be a yes or a no for that one?
[17 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's yeah to the last one, yeah.
[17 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So for the type 2 diabetes, OK, not to worry. I just need to repeat one question. I'm so sorry. I may have read it incorrectly. So I just need to make sure I've done right by you. So for have you been diagnosed with or currently undergoing testing for or has the doctor advised you to be tested for motor neuron disease or any form of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease? Sorry that was that a yes or no?
[17 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : That's a knife.
[17 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : All got that. All right, well, that comes to the end of the questions. Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to go through that. Thank you for your honesty as well. I'm very happy to tell you you've been approved for the life insurance. We are able to offer you your life insurance policy, which is really great to say umm. So what I'm going to do now I'll take you through in more detail on exactly what's going to come included as part of your insurance now that you have been approved. Understanding the reason that you're looking to take out cover. You've had recent losses within your circle. You mentioned you had close friends again, I'm so sorry to hear made you think of your partner and your son wanting to leave some money behind for them. So again I can some that you have been approved. It's subject to the following terms and conditions. We are able to offer you a benefit amount of $50,000 to $100,000 with a policy term of 20 years. Now under this cover you will have the death benefit included. So for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death only and then after 12 months you will be covered for deaths due to any cause. However, suicide is not covered in the 1st 13 months of the policy. So once you're approved for the life insurance, correct, I can confirm you will be approved for life on the amount for you to organize to cover on. And what I'm referring to that is Touchwood, nothing happens.
[19 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : None.
[19 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : But say for example, you were to develop any health conditions or have any complications to help you to a pre-existing condition. It will never impact your original life insurance and that will all be covered under after the first 12 months. Uh, for example, the type 2 diabetes. Does that make sense Sir?
[19 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[19 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, because again, for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death only and then after 12 months you will be covered for death to choose you any cause. However, suicide is not covered in the 1st 13 months of the policy. Now there's a terminally ill advanced payment included as well. So this is a living benefit. This one is for you and it's after hold you holding your policy for 12 months. If you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay the entire lump sum to you and that's designed to help you with your medical expenses, ensuring you're getting the best care possible as well. OK. Now at the time of your passing, your family can also request an advance payout of $10,000 that is there to hold with more of those immediate expenses like funeral calls, unpaid bills. Because in terms of that advance payout, claims pay quickly, usually within one business day of completed documents being received there. OK.
[20 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[20 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So could you've been approved for three amounts, 50,000 dollars, $75,000 and $100,000. If we do have a look at insuring you for our top cover, 100,000 comes in at $246.17 per fortnight, so it quotes to $123.09 per week approximately for $100,000 to be left behind there.
[21 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Hmm.
[21 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, now I understand there was a change to the price, umm, originally, umm, of course that's because you've been approved due to the terms and conditions. Again, the great news is we can still offer cover, We can still offer you your life insurance, but of course, it still needs to remain within your budget. Is that still comfortable for your budget? That correct? Or did you want to take a look at it?
[21 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's getting a bit up there now.
[21 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : The other amounts we can offer, I understand.
[21 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : I don't know.
[21 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : The reason I ask, you've been approved for three amounts, so there's a $50,000 cover and a $75,000 cover as well. Just to show you these other options, if we look at 75,000, it's $184.63 per fortnight, which is 9230. Two, $92.32 per week, leaving 75,000 behind. All we have the $50,000 cover which is $123.09 per fortnight, which is $61.55 per week and that's leaving $50,000 behind for your partner and your son there. How do those amounts sound within the budget? Which one's sounding better out of the 50 and the 75?
[22 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[22 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : 75,000 Not a way we can keep it with the 75,000 for you then, because in regards to the amount that you're covered for, that's going to automatically increase as well. And I'll explain to you how it works. So firstly, please be aware that your premium is set, which means it will generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amounts will increase by 2% with associated increases in premium. However, you can opt out of this indexation each year we'll let you know 30 days prior of the indexation being added. So if you wish to opt out, just call me back there. OK?
[23 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[23 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : That's everything that comes included this part of your cover. Once again, the great news is you've been approved for the cover. We can most only offer the life insurance based on that $75,000 cover. So now that you've been approved, understanding again, you're looking to take out this cover and thinking of your partner and your son, umm, we can go ahead and get that policy organized for you where it's all the range from today, but you will not need to make any payments straight away with getting this policy in place. What's going to happen from here? We'll be getting all your tailored documents sent across to your e-mail address and putting it in writing to your home address as well. Now. This will have everything you need to know about your life insurance. It gives you a chance to sit down, have a good read over it all. Once you have, you will find a beneficiaries form within those documents. We do kindly ask if you can please fill that out for us and send that back to us so we know who to leave your life insurance to. But if you if you were to have a change of part with the policy for any reason at all, this policy does provide you with a 30 day cooling off. So if you decide the policy is no longer suitable for you and you cancel the policy within the 30 days, you'll receive a full refund of your premium just unless the claim has been made there.
[24 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[24 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I'll jot down your address so we know where to get the documents sent to you on. Do you know what your post code is? The 4 digits? If not, it's OK. Yeah.
[24 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : No, I think it's 3401.
[24 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : What suburb do you live in?
[24 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : I think it's 3 401.
[24 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, you got a spot on. Well done. Honestly, I never blame anybody when they're a bit unsure on the post code. It's not something that we use very often anymore.
[24 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got to use that a lot.
[24 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Like, if you ask me, I do.
[24 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : We got to use it a lot in Australia.
[24 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. In Australia it's different. In New Zealand, not so much. Oh, no, You've done well. If you all see my post code right now, I don't think I would have a clue, honestly. So you've done well.
[25 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : It is OK.
[25 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Can I ask your address as well, please?
[25 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : One Ward St. Wahro.
[25 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : On Ward St. OK. And your home address, is it the same as your postal address? Do you receive them your mail there?
[25 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Is it the same as One Ward St. Wahro?
[25 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So you receive all your mail then with your postal address.
