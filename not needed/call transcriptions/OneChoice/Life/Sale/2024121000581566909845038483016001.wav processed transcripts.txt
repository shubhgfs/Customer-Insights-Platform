[11 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[11 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Now I just need to go. You're welcome. Uh, so I just need to let you know what the final, what that means for the final terms, but I do wanna double check the pricing, uh, just because one of the questions was different.
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So basically now that the application part has been approved, it means that this policy can cover you for death to any cause except for suicide in the 1st 13 months. That starts as soon as you accept the declaration to the policy. Umm, so essentially I can have you covered by the end of this phone call. Now, you still have access to that terminally owe advanced payments, and your beneficiaries still have access to that advanced payout of $10,000. The premiums on the cover are stamped, which means it'll generally increase each year. In addition though, the policy comes with an automatic indexation increase, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 5% and then of course, will come with an associated increase in the premiums. But the good news is you can opt out of their automatic indexation increase each year. Now in terms of price. So this is the one I wanted to check.
[12 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, So it has changed and it did come down to the BMI questions I've got in this index. Now for the 300,000, you're looking at $70.69 per fortnight. Is that one still suitable?
[12 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. New way you can go.
[12 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Did you want me to look at something a little bit lower?
[13 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, that's alright.
[13 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, did you want me to look at 2:50 or 200 or something lower than that 250? Let's have a look Now I just need to confirm that you've already answered the questions. 1 moment.
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Maybe like 250B 10 minutes. I'll say here we are. Hello.
[13 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yes and yes. Pardon.
[13 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's all I thought. No, you're right.
[13 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK. So if we were to bring it down to 250,000, that would bring the price down to 5891 a fortnight that one.
[13 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep. There, there. Thank you.
[13 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : You're welcome. So now that we've been approved, we've got the price down to something that you like. What I'm doing now is I get you immediately covered over the phone today. You don't pay anything upfront today, but you do choose the date you want the first payment to come out plus all of cash bank account details over the phone so that we can take care of that for you as well. I'll also send out policy documents which will come with a 30 day cooling off. So you'll be covered by us while you're going over everything if you decide it's not suitable or you just change your mind and that's fine. If you cancel it within the 30 days, you'll get a full refund on all the payments you had made anyway, unless the claim has been made and then of course we're paying out the benefit amount.
[14 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[14 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK. You'll receive 2 copies of the policy, so one bit will be to your e-mail address and the other will be to your home address.

Now you get to choose the dates that the first payment comes out and we generally click payment within the next seven days. What date would you like the first payment to be though?
[14 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Can we make it next seven days? Can we make it a fortnight from this Tuesday? By next fortnight, that next Tuesday? That's right. Yeah. The next fortnight. Yeah, that'll be that.
