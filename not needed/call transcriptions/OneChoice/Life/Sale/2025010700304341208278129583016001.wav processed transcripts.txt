Touchwood now for you right now, Susan, that we don't want anything happened to you, that's for sure.

And so when that time does eventually come, umm, you know, this can be used to help your loved ones, such as helping them pay off mortgage or loan or any other costs involved in raising a family.

[39 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. So just one more thing, umm, Susan, just wanting to ask umm, because you know, with umm, a lot of the umm, financial protections and Peace of Mind, uh, we do also have another umm product if you want on Peace of Mind in case if you were to pass away or with a funeral product. Is that something you'd be interested into looking at? So with the pro, umm, it's, it's, it's called the funeral products. Uh, sorry, a funeral, funeral cover, the to cover.
[40 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's the life insurance. That's the federal color.

[40 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[40 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no problem. So what else, You know, cover. So similarly, it is, you know, designed to provide that Peace of Mind for you in case, you know, if you work.
[40 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : I can't hear you properly. I can't hear you properly.
[41 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : None.
[41 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : I can't hear you. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
[41 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Breaking up very bad. I don't know if you can hear me either.
[41 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I can't. I can't. I can't even hear anything.
[41 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : You can't.
[41 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : I can't hear anything. You see?
[41 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : You can't hear anything I say.
[42 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : No, it was breaking up.
[42 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, now it's coming back. Yeah, same. I couldn't hear what you're saying. I was like, I was like, yeah. So I I understand.
[42 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it was breaking up.
[42 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it was ringing up really bad. OK, luckily maybe it's just a connection that for that moment, but likely we got back to. I was just about to say I'll give you a call again, but it's it's back to normal.
[42 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : None.
[42 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : You can hear me and I can hear you. Awesome. So I'll say that again. So with our funeral cover, it is to provide. I was saying that Peace of Mind, if, you know, if you were to pass away, we would pay the money to your loved ones to help, not only for funeral expenses, but you know, any other final expenses such as unpaid bills. OK, so we don't allocate, we'll tell you how to use the money. It's all up to you, uh, or them of what they, umm, of what's needed of what's needed for the beneficiary have for your loved ones. And so you can nominate the same up to five beneficiaries to receive this benefit amount. And if this was due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple. Let's say for example, if you chose 10,000 benefit amount, that will be tripled to 30,000, OK.
[43 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[43 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : And also there's another part where, umm, another occasion where can be tripled is if you were to suffer an accidental serious injury such as quadriplegia or paraplegia before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, that benefit amount will also be tripled. So under those two occasions, that will be tripled for you, OK.
[43 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[43 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : And for the 1st 12 months, you will be covered for accidental death and accidental series injury only for the ones I just mentioned before. And then after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any call. And in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner. So even though this is a funeral cover while you're still living, we will pay the full benefit amount to you during that time to ensure you receive that best care possible. And with this cover, it's even easier to apply because there's no medical checks or any umm health questions asked at all. And you are already guaranteed to be accepted for this funeral cover as you have already confirmed to me that you are a New Zealand resident currently residing in New Zealand and also aged between 18 and 79. So you don't have to worry about the eligibility part.
[44 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. That's, that's good.
[44 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So, yeah, how does this sound to you so far with this funeral cover sounds? Yep.
[45 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : But I think with my life insurance, uh, we'll cover everything.
[45 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, so you're happy with what you don't have. You don't you want, you don't want to know more or go ahead with any of the funeral to know more about the funeral.
[45 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Uh, not, not now, not now.
[45 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Not now. Yeah. No problem. Yep.
[45 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Uh, because I'm yeah, because I've studied and I'm I I'm only, umm, get it to pay this one.
[45 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no problem.
[45 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : This one is really important. Yeah, but probably later later on.
[45 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, that's totally fine because you know, we have this cover here and if you're later on, if you're interested, you can give us a call as our, umm, numbers on the, umm, policy documentation anyway, but also on our website. So if you're interested with that, you know, cover later on, you're more, umm, we're more than happy to assist you further.
