[2 seconds][Customer] : Hello, Debbie speaking.
[3 seconds][Agent] : Hey, good afternoon. It's Abram calling from One Choice Life Insurance. How you going today?
[8 seconds][Customer] : Hey, good. Thanks, Fabia, how are you?
[10 seconds][Agent] : That's good to hear. I'm not too bad as well. Thank you so much for asking as I'm just giving a call 'cause we had an expression of interest that was placed yesterday for our life insurance that we're just giving a hand to help you through. Was I speaking with Dudley Parsons?
[23 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's the one.
[24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. And then I've just got date of birth was the 15th of December 1991. Beautiful. Just with residency in New Zealand as well. Can I confirm that you are a male New Zealand resident currently residing in New Zealand?
[30 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's correct.
[40 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. And I'm so sorry. I'm just with that. Was that yes to that whole question. So sorry.
[46 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[47 seconds][Agent] : No problem at all, Dudley. And just without calls, Please note that calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is limited to the products we offer and this is you need to make a decision about whether they're suitable for your needs. We do not consider your personal circumstances, but as well in terms of life insurance.
[46 seconds][Customer] : So the whole question, no cover in place at the moment, something new.
[1 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : And just so I can have a little bit of a better understanding, do you currently have some cover in place or was this something that might be new to you, something new that's some understandable with what sparked your interest? Was it more for the Peace of Mind for your family and loved ones or was this maybe to cover a mortgage that you might have?
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, cover and mortgage that we've got and and Peace of Mind from for my family too.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, understandable. So for a for a bit of both for sure. Well, so designed for both these reasons. It's there to provide that Peace of Mind for your family and loved ones. If you want to pass away that have that financial protection, it could help pay off the mortgage loans or any other cost involved in raising a family.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : But basically there to give you that Peace of Mind if something happened to you that have that financial security with the loved ones and family. Do you know specifically who would want to look at leaving this too? That's OK, that's no problem at all. You have plenty of time to decide. But you can nominate up to five people to be a beneficiary.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Not at this stage, yeah.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So if you're wanting your children to receive this or partner, you have full control over that list. There's also an advance payout of $10,000 that gets paid out advance for the funeral costs.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : That is helping for those types of costs and expenses. And there's also a terminally ill advanced payout, which goes a bit if this were to ever happen to you. But if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less delivered by a medical practitioner, that's when we pay that claim to in full last your life to help with any further medical costs that may occur. But nice simple process in terms of applying. There's no medical checks or blood tests that we require you to complete. There's just some yes and no health and lifestyle questions that just determine the final pricing in the terms of the policy. We'll go through an estimated quote together. I've just got to ask, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? That's OK. I'm very healthy choice. I've just got to grab. So sorry, just for my call recordings. Was that yes or no? So sorry, No, that. No, that's OK. No problem at all. With your current annual income, is it more than $50,000 annually like you need?
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK, Nah, Nah, no, no cigarettes, yes.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : It's OK, no problem. For the amount of cover you can look at it does range from $100,000 being the starting amount. It goes all the way up to $2,000,000 for our life insurance. But what amount would you like me to quote on or would be a suitable amount you'd like to leave to your family and loved ones? And OK that's OK I'll pull up the 800,000 and if you'd like me to move up or down just let me know. So far though, it's the estimated indicative price is at $37.08 a fortnight for 800,000 so far. Yeah, 37 and eight cents a fortnight for the 800 K so far.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : 800,000 course $37.08 It might be OK. Beautiful so far. Sounds good, yeah.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : But how's that one sounding so so far love Lovely. We do have umm, it's an additional coverage you can add on to the life insurance, but it's more for these insured events. It's for heart attack, cancer, stroke or if you were to undergo coronary bypass surgery. This one, it's called serious illness cover and it's used as like a living benefit to assist in any rehabilitation costs or even as an income replacement as you might be recovering. It's all entirely up to you that if you'd like on the policy, but would it be something you're interested in?
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, it would be something I'm interested in.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. Again, those events it's for heart attack, cancer, stroke or undergo coronary bypass surgery. Each of these events are defined within the policy and each claim is assessed against these definitions. You can apply from anywhere from $50,000 up to the lesser of 500,000 or 50% of your chosen life insurance benefit. Even to give you an idea of what the 50,000 would look like, it'd then be $3.25 a four fortnight on top of the life insurance premium.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : None.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So then as a total altogether it'd be $40.33 a fortnight. You can choose from 50,000 all the way up to 400,000 for that one. That's OK. I'll leave it at the 50K for you at 3:25. And just with those events, any insured events that become apparent before during the first three months of the serious illness option commencing will not be covered. Full details of all exclusions are set out in your policy document. Please also be aware that any payment made under serious illness cover reduces available life insurance benefit amount. If you also purchase total and permanent disability cover, the TPD benefit amount will also reduce when you have a successful serious illness claim. But I've just got to ask, are you happy for me to add this optional cover to your quote? Yes or no?
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Alright, I will just go for the minimum for now, yes.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. No problem. What we'll do together is we'll go through those questions to get that final outcome. Well, the person, it can stay the same, it can change. It's just depending on those questions.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Just got to read a paragraph that says please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes.
