[1 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, easy. We'll have a look at both of those to start with and we can go from there. It's pretty straightforward cover. So it doesn't matter which amount you choose, it's all going to work the same.

[2 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Sure, I don't smoke cigarettes but I do pay.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, thank you. Yes, there And then. Do you prefer a fortnightly monthly annual premium just for your schedule?

[9 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Which is the one that doesn't require insulin type 2.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : It's definitely one of those two that that's, that's all the questions. I don't need to know the exact type, but it's definitely the type one or type 2. Is that correct?
[9 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, so we do yes, there done and done. All right, perfect. Well Andrew great news is that you're approved for some life insurance covered today. So I'll walk you through what we have got you approved for. If you've got any questions at this point I've got all in front of me now so I can go through each individually there for you. So what you've been able to you've been able to approve before is subject to the following terms and conditions. So we're able to offer your benefit amounts of the following 50,075 thousand, all $100,000 of cover with a policy term of 20 years. Now on this policy you have those three benefits we went through earlier. So in terms of how these would work, the death benefit, the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death only and then after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause, OK.
[9 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : However, suicide is not covered in the 1st 13 months of the policy. You'll then also have included the terminally ill advanced payment cover, so after holding the policy for 12 months, if you were diagnosed with a terminal illness. So with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, pay the full claim to you whilst you're living. Then you've also got the advanced payer for funeral costs. So your loved ones will still be able to request the advanced payer of $10,000 to help those funeral costs as well. So that's all going to be included there for you. If we go with the $100,000 of cover, we're looking at $133.59 a fortnight for you. How's that something to start with?
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : So that is 100,000 is the maximum now now, not the 600 to start with, OK.
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, correct. Yeah, correct. The reason I say to start with two, two things. First thing, it's going to increase by 2% each year, OK? So next year it's 100 and 2002 percent on that, 2% on that every year, OK? So that happens automatically. Now you've got control of it. So if you get to the point where you're like I don't need any extra cover, you can cut that off basically, OK. So it's called our automatic indexation. That's the first thing. The second thing for you in your specific situation in the future, we may be able to offer you the higher levels of cover, OK? What it's really come down to today is your health that, but that's really it, OK.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh.
[11 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So if we get the BMI under a certain range, OK, So back within maybe like a, you know, a lower level than what it is at the moment, OK, that's one fact that's going to help it because 2 with the diabetes question, when the BMI is slightly higher, oftentimes what happens? You better ask further questions about the diabetes. Listen, your diabetes might be well controlled. You might not have any symptoms. I don't actually know that at the moment.
[12 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[12 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : But the, the kind of questionnaire doesn't really care because the outcome's not gonna be any different whether if we get that BMI down under, OK, what what it needs to be for this application and not just what it needs to be for your health. I'm talking about that. But just for this application specifically, we may be able to go through those extra questions and still offer you, you know, the higher levels of cover. Now, it may be more expensive, don't get me wrong, but it still may give you the option to actually get those higher levels of cover.
[12 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[12 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Because we've got plenty of my clients who, you know, we start out with the limited cover that was explained to you today. And then two years time they call you back, they're like, OK, let's do a diabetes, but my weight's back, you know, within like a normal limit, if you will.
[12 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : And then we can get them that high level of cover. So those are the kind of two things just to be aware of at the moment. Yeah, that that's pretty much pretty much where it stands.
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[13 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Just to be transparent with you because something to understand the reasoning why.
[13 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, cool.
[13 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful.
[13 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK. So where do we go from here?
[13 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Well, the next steps. Is everything basically approved? All good today. Next thing is we'll confirm your home and postal address. Let me know what they kind of would work best for you each fortnight. And that way we can align it to your schedule and it's not kind of, you know, interfere with anything else. Then I'll read you a short declaration and that's pretty much all done.
[13 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : OK cool.
[13 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So pretty straightforward from here on out. Wonderful. Yep. Yep.
[13 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Alright, so my postal address is 417 B Racecourse Rd.
[13 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Race Course Rd. Yep.
[13 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Waipa Canal.
[13 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[13 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : It's 4282.
[13 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : And the post code 4282, is that home and postal? Yeah, both the same.
[14 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Pardon. Yeah, Home and Postal's the same.
[14 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Home and postal.
[14 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : That's yeah.
[14 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Right.
[14 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : That's RD22 as well, by the way.
[14 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Two. There it is. Yeah. Perfect. I always ask them the real clients. Yeah, sometimes it's got like their boxes and things like that.
[14 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : No, yeah, no, we haven't.
[14 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : No, I think honestly it's fine. I don't usually have any issues. I've never got the like the correct delivery number. It usually kind of works out fine.
[14 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : We haven't quite got that far yet, but Yep, yeah.
[14 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : I think sometimes I just get kind of a bit confused with the whole situation, right? The other thing I'll let you know about, Andrews, please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year.
[14 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[14 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : And then in addition, as we spoke about, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 2% with associated increases in premium. However, you can opt out of this indexation each year as well. We'll just put that in. Did you have a particular day each fortnight you wanted to align it to?
[14 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK, so I got paid last. God, I don't even know what day it is.
[15 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's I'm trying to catch up myself to be honest. So all good.
[15 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : It's I got paid on the 31st, so my next pay I get paid fortnightly on a Tuesday. So it would make sense to start the premiums the next payday.
[15 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So that's the 14th.
[15 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So not this coming Tuesday, but the one after if that's what it W exactly.
[15 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yep, perfect. Now just another question, is your pay for like in there first thing in the morning or in the afternoon it goes in.
[15 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Sure it's in the afternoon, maybe, maybe the Wednesday.
[15 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, what I'll do if it's OK if we do the Wednesday just because, yeah, that that's trying to say. Perfect.
[15 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, that's.
