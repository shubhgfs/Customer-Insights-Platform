[23 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Uh, but look in regards for that one there, as I know you mentioned that it is sounding affordable there and you wanted to leave that money behind to your husband and your children there. What I'm actually able to do for yourself here today is, is provide you that little bit of peace and mind of financial security there and actually get you immediately covered over the phone today. And what that allows me to do for yourself there is actually send out all your tailored policy documents in 2000 ways. The first one would be buy out to your e-mail and the second copy would be out to your address there. So of course you have those documents to sit down and review there and with this policy here it does give you a 30 day cooling off. So if you do decide this policy is not suitable for you and cancel within the 30 days then you will receive a full refund of your claim. I'm sorry, a full refund of your premium. Unless of course, the claim has been made, which Touchwood I hope in the 1st 30 days is not made for yourself. So with this one as well, we don't actually require any upfront possible payments from yourself here today. So with that one, all I actually do is pop down the preferred payment date in the near future for yourself.

[24 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So if there's any pay cycles or bill cycles you're wanting to link it up to you, I can certainly arrange for that one there for yourself as well as the preferred payment method.

[24 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : But when will be most suitable for yourself there to have that first payment date come out on a Friday? Yeah, was it, would it, would it be this Friday or next Friday or the Friday after? When will be the best Friday to take that first payment for yourself?
[24 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : I think so if I sent in a payment now so that it needs to withdraw.
[25 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So with this one, the payment doesn't have to come out today. So with this one here, I can simply pop down the preferred payment date in the near future of your liking. However, if we pop that in there today, you will be covered from today regardless of the first payment coming out or not.
[25 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Alright, alright. So if I did say so, it's all starting already.

[32 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yes, no, I'm all good.
[32 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : No, no worries. I can go through and accept that one there for yourself there with me. That one is just loading there. And while I do have you on the phone here today, that one is all completed and done there. But while I do have you on the phone here today as well, we do actually have some funeral insurance here that we can look at as a policy here at one choice there. That's something you're interested in, wanted to look at there for yourself. Is that something you're interested in?
[33 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, maybe that.
[33 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Well, look, we can certainly, uh, take a look at the cover there for yourself. I can explain a bit of the cover to yourself there.
[33 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I yeah, yeah.
[33 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Beautiful. Well, look in regards to our funeral insurance here at one choice, uh, with this one here, uh, our cover does provide a cash benefit of up to $30,000.
[33 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[33 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Now with this one here, there is going to be two instances where your chosen benefit amount is going to triple. Now the first one for yourself here is in the event Touchwood, that your death was due to an accident, the chosen benefit amount would triple. So say we look at $10,000 here today for yourself with some Li funeral insurance, in the event that your death was deemed an accident, we would actually pay the benefit amount out to your beneficiaries there of $30,000. So we would triple that benefit amount there that you're covered for, yeah. Now the second instance for yourself where the choice and benefit amount will triple is in the event that you were to suffer an accidental serious injury such as codraplegia or paraplegia before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday. Then the benefit amount will also triple. That instance there for yourself now.
[34 minutes][Customer] : Oh, yeah, OK.
[34 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, now we'll let you know with our funeral coverage here. After the first 12 months, you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. And then after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause.
[34 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[34 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Now in in addition as well with this one here, there is the terminal on, there is a terminal onus benefit, which what that means there again for yourself is also holding your policy for 12 months. If you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we would again in that instance pay the benefit of that out to yourself as what we like to call that living benefit there. So you can actually do with what you see fit with that money there as well. And we wouldn't tell you how to spend a single cent of that money.
[35 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[35 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful.
[35 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : It's just extending exiting or the the the funeral thing not significant.
[35 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Now with this one, with that funeral, Yeah, sorry, yes, Oh, sorry, no. So with this one here in regards to the accidental death and the accidental serious injury, they're just what's covered in the 1st 12 months.
[35 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : And then after this, after the first 12 months, you will be covered for best due to any cause.
[35 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : What?
[35 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So whether it's a natural cause or an accident, you're going to be completely covered. Yeah.
[35 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[35 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Now with this one here as well, just keep in mind with the benefit amount we can look at the minimum being $3000 up to the maximum being $30,000. Now with this one there, how much would you like me to quote you on for the funeral and benefit amount there?
[36 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : MMM MMM, I didn't know yet.
[36 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. Look, have you thought about how you, ah, you're wanting to be umm, have you a funeral there? Was it where you want to be cremated or buried?
[36 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : I'm been talking to my husband by the if I if it happened here, I wanted to cremate.
[36 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Well, look in, in regards to that one there, I can actually let you know that we have done some market value research in regards to what a, uh, standard, uh, sorry, an average, uh, cost of a standard cremation is in New Zealand and it comes out to work around to be 7500 there. Now in regards to that one that I can certainly quote you around that $8000 mark there. We could look at what that benefit and that is looking like for yourself.
[36 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[36 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, beautiful. So looking at $8000 worth a few, Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, but that's not a worry.
[36 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : But The thing is like if, let me think, but yeah, you only keep it like like the other 112 months, then after 12 months then it's free for whoever.
[37 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So yeah, yeah, it's just like 12 month waiting period that you do wait and then you'll be completely covered. Yeah.
[37 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : What kind of diff and how much is it for Fortnite, please?
[37 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So the $8000 one for yourself at a fortnightly premium, you would be looking at $20.40 a fortnight? Yeah.
[37 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Fortnite is that for how much is it?
[37 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : And with $8000 worth of cover, yes.
[37 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Oh, but it's like I like the city, city crane. How much?
[37 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Were you wanting to know how much the 30 gram was? Yeah, Well, look, looking at the $30,000 for yourself, you would be looking at a fortnightly premium of $76.50. How is that one sounding? Well.
[37 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : MMM, no, it's good, but.
[37 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Well, look, we can, we can certainly bring the benefit amount down. But with this one as well for yourself, I will let you know that your premiums are level, which means they are designed to stay consistent year on year and not increase as you age there Yeah and in regards to the life insurance, just touching base back on that one there that we did get for yourself, uh, after the first 12 months you are completely covered of course, but except for the suicide, the suicide is after the 1st 13 months of the policy with the life insurance. I just wanted to read verify with that one there. Yeah, beautiful. Yes. So with that one, it's within the terminal on this benefits.
[38 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, with that life insurance, like after 12 months, if I become like illness, I can't work anymore, you guys will just pay the money to me, Yeah.
[38 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, you can certainly apply to have that card. So with that, one day you can claim for that one there is a living benefit there. So that one will be paid out to yourself while you're living. And same goes with this one.
[39 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, the the. I like that for the.
[39 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : There is after holding your policy for 12 months, if you're first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less delivered by a medical practitioner, we also would pay this benefit amount out to yourself as well there to do with what you seek it with the money that you know. Yeah, beautiful. And was that what that benefit amount there sounding affordable there? That's $76.50 a fortnight.
[39 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : That's all I think tried to figure it out.
[39 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Look, it's completely understandable. They look if there's a little less that you, yeah, 10,000, yeah. So looking at $10,000 for yourself there, you would be looking at a fortnightly premium of $25.50.
[39 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Maybe you wish that, wish that was a little bit the Ting Ting.
[39 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : It is bring it down.
[39 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, the name is, Of course that was.
[39 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Well, look with that one there is all for yourself. I will actually let you know three benefits you become entitled to when you reach the beautiful age of 85. Now, yes.
[40 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : I wish.
[40 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Hey, look, potentially good touch would just feel young and healthy and beautiful. But with that one there, the first benefit you actually become entitled to when you do reach the age of 85 is that your premiums will save. So what that means for yourself is you're actually no longer required to make any further payments to your premium and we're still going to continue to cover yourself there. So your policy was still remaining 4. So you're just no longer required to make any more payments to your premium. And then the second benefit is what we're going to do for yourself on our end is we're going to automatically add an additional 25%, uh, bonus cover on top of your benefit amount there. So in that incident, if you're looking at the $10,000 worth of cover, after you do reach, when you do reach the age of 85, we're going to automatically add an additional 2500 on top of your benefit amount there at no further cost. And the third one that you have entitlement to there, the third benefit, is that anytime after your 85th birthday here at One Choice, we do have something called an early cash out option. And this is where you can actually choose to end your cover. And we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit amount there for yourself.
[41 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : I don't think I will reach the age.
[41 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Oh well, well look, fingers crossed and hopefully you do that.
[41 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : I hope so.
[41 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : You never know, but hopefully so too you do.
[41 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Sometimes our body, our body can deal with our thoughts. Yeah.
[41 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : You do have of course, I I completely und yeah, no, of course and I completely understand. But look about by the sounds that you you do sound stronger and you are keeping yourself healthy. But look in regards to that one, the 85 is quite a bit away for yourself there.
[41 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it is.
[41 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : The fingers crossed that you do live up to that one there.
[41 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : I just then lend what I hate on me, but yes.
[41 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : But look, with that, Yeah, no, of course. Well, look, it's beautiful.
[41 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : But yeah, yeah.
[42 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : It's lovely to hear that you you're wanting to do that for your family there and have all this organized touch wood event that you're passed away there. So it's always beautiful here that you're wanting that financial security and Peace of Mind there that when you do pass away, you do have something for your family.
[42 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[42 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[42 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : That's what I'm like.
[42 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Well, look. Yeah.
[42 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : But I think I have a look.
[42 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Do you know?
[42 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : I have a think about the the funeral cost.
