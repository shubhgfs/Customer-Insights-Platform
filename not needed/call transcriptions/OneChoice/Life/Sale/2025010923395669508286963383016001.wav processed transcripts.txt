[2 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah. So you can keep that one and then take up another one or you can you know, you can, you can cancel that one and take it just just wha another policy. But having it two policies won't affect.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : So it's like, oh, OK, so that would be kind of a bonus because if something bad did happen and the children get them with the insurance from both insurances.
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : That's correct. That's So what this having a 2 policies or having another policy with ask it doesn't affect your current 1.

[3 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Certainly, yes. CER.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : But but more, you know, doesn't have to be. I don't want like 500,000, but I mean more around 100 to 200,000 kind of something around me.

[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : I thought they would take it out of this, the 50,000, and then they would share the rest, which is really what anything means. Flying or something thousand each. So Oh my gosh, how ridiculous.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, well, yeah, well with this one here. So there's that advanced part. Now once we receive the relevant documentation from the JPO medical practitioner and it doesn't necessarily have to be a death certificate with me, not how long that they can some of those can take.
