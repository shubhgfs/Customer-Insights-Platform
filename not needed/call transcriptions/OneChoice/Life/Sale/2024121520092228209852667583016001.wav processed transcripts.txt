[1 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I'll, I'll take you through how our cover works here, what we can offer so I can explain that for you. Can I have you confirm your first and last name and date of birth there, please?

[1 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Thank you very much. And Sandra also confirming that you are, of course, a female New Zealand resident currently residing in New Zealand. Yes or no? Thank you.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So Please note all calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is limited to the products we offer and assisting you to make a decision about whether they are suitable for your needs.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : We do not consider your personal circumstances.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, so with the inquiry today, it was about our life insurance cover. So we've got two other death policies here. So we've got the life insurance or two death policies I should say. We have the life insurance cover, OK, but we've also got our funeral insurance cover as well. Alright, so the life insurance doesn't quite feel right. I'll explain the funeral cover for you and and how that works as well. OK, but any questions as we go through things you let me know straight away. Alright.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : But it's all pretty straightforward. So it should be nice and easy.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Our life insurance is kind of set up in this three different ways. So first thing you need to select is how much cover you want to be covered for, because this is your choice at the start. What we can offer is $100,000 and then up to a maximum of $1 million. OK, so it's a range of cover to start with. Within that range, you've got three benefits that will recover you for. So it'll be a death coverage. So it'll pay the full claim to your loved ones. When you pass away.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : It'll be a terminally ill advanced payment cover. So Sandra, if you're diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we'll pay the full claim to you, but whilst you are still living, OK. So they'll give you direct access to the money at that time.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Our third benefit is advance payout for funeral cost. So this doesn't just have to exclusively be used on funerals, it can be used on anything. OK, but what happens is that claims times when your loved ones get in contact with us, let us know that you've passed and then start that process. They can request an advance payout of $10,000 to help your funeral costs and any other final expenses as well.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, so all of that is included in one policy. OK Regardless if you choose 100,000, if you choose a million, it doesn't matter. OK, Any questions of those ones so far?
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : No, it's only good so far.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful. Now, in terms of levels of cover that we offer, how much were we wanting to look at today? Hundreds. Yeah, easy. Let's start there now. Sandra, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : I was looking at 100, I think I was, yes.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Okie Dokie. So for the $100,000 of cover works out to be a total of $32.46 each fortnight. OK, so that's the starting point for that one. How's that sounding?
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Each fortnight.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Correct.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that sounds really good.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic, wonderful. Now of course, we still have to go through the health and lifestyle questions. So we'll come back to the price in the end once you've confirmed everything that we need to. But good to see we're starting off at a good point there for you. Now, Sandra, before I take you through this next step of the questions, I'm going to read you what's called the pre underwriting disclosure. OK?
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. Yep.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Now all this is just what you can expect from me going through the questions and then what we expect from you when you're answering the questions as well. OK?
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : But if you need me to repeat any of this, you let me know straight away so it reads. Please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes. We collect your personal information to provide insurance quotes, issue cover and other related services. We will share this with your insurer and may share it with other service providers for the purpose of administering your policy or handling claims. Our privacy policy tells you more, including how to access and correct your information and lodge complaints about breaches of privacy. I also need to inform you about your duty of disclosure before you enter into a life insurance contract.

Sandra, do you understand this yes or no? Thank you very much. Now for all these questions, I'm going to be a bit of a stickler here, but just need a clear yes or a clear no response for the majority of them. If you're unsure how to answer something within those parameters, you let me know straight away and I will help you. OK, But just for the call recording needs to be clear.

[20 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : No, for the 5 million, but yes, I am with another insurance company.
[20 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Of course, Perfect. So that's all that matters. So put a note for that one there. And then the next question is, have you ever had symptoms of being diagnosed with or treated for or intend to seek medical advice for any of the following diabetes, raised blood sugar, impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose?
[21 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : I am so busy.
[21 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Now that's the case. No, just yes or no for these ones. Yeah. Thank you. And is it type one or type 2 diabetes? Yes or no?
[21 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, Type 2.
[21 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Is it one of those two, Type 2? Thank you. Done and done. Perfect. Right, Sandra, that is all the questions we need to ask you today. And the great news is I have got you approved for the life insurance cover. OK. So I'm going to walk you through your options, go through the pricing, but please, if you've got any questions, you let me know straight away. Have an awesome. I'll come there for you there. Yeah. What we've been able to approve before is subject to the following terms and conditions. So we're able to offer you a benefit amount of the following 50,075 thousand or $100,000 of cover with a policy term of 20 years. Now on this policy you're going to have those three benefits we spoke about earlier. So you'll have the death, the terminal illness and the funeral cover.
[21 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[22 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : For the death benefit for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death only and then after 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause. OK so it doesn't matter even if it's a pre-existing thing, you're fully covered from that point. However suicide is not covered in the 1st 13 months of the policy. The second benefit as I said is a terminally ill advanced payment cover. So after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we'll pay the full claim to you whilst you're alive. And of course, as we spoke about, your loved ones will still be able to request the advance payout of $10,000 to help with your funeral cost as well. OK, so that's all include on the one.
[23 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[23 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Any questions so far there?
[23 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : That's good, Safa.
[23 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Awesome, perfect. Now please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it would generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount, so how much you're covered for, will increase by 2% with associated increases in premium. However, you can opt out of this indexation each year as well. So Sandra, if we go with the $100,000 that cover for you, the final pricing is $87.34 per fortnight. How's that sounding for you there?
[23 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Sounding alright so far.
[23 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yes, fantastic. Did you want to look at the other two or are you happy they're at the 100,000? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So if we do the 50 instead, that is $43.67 every fortnight. And then if you do the 75 just to show you in between $65.51 a fortnight.
[24 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll, I'll do the 40 the, the, the the 50,000.
[24 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : That's the 50 for 4367. No dramas at all. Let's bring that up for you now, Sandra, the next thing I need to confirm is the current home and postal address for you. What was the post code at the moment?
[24 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 5024.
[24 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful. And the suburb?
[24 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Put it your door.
[24 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Thank you.
[24 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : 19 Bologna Place, Tennis Creek.
[24 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : And the address place there we are. And is this both home and postal, are they the same address? Thank you so much. Now Sandra, with your existing cover, I know it might be a little bit different to this, but I just need to advise that if you are replacing an existing policy with this cover, we recommend that you do not cancel it until you have received and reviewed our policy in full as it may not be identical to your existing cover. Now the other thing in in that regard is we obviously don't want you doubling up on payments if we can avoid it.
[24 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Same address on a Thursday?
[25 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what day did you want to align this payment to to make sure it works for yourself on that Thursday? Starting from which Thursday?
[25 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, starting from next fortnight. Is that alright or no?
[25 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[25 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Say 2.
[25 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, that's absolutely fine. So this Thursday would be the 19th, and then the fortnight after that will be the second. Now that's obviously going to be a public holiday. Did you want to do the third?
[25 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's it.
[25 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Is the Friday OK, or does it need to be on the Thursday?
[25 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : I don't know. It's a Friday.
[25 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[25 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Can do it on the.
[25 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[25 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, on the 3rd.
[25 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : No dramas at all. Do that there. And your best e-mail is sandramcgregor1973@gmail.com. Thank you very much. Wonderful. All right, Sandra, did you want to organize that through a Visa or MasterCard or an account number? Account number? What was that number there? Yeah. It's up to yourself. I, I've got to be careful. I can't advise you to do anything in particular, OK. Once this policy is in force, you'll be coming with us from today. So that's your decision.
[26 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yes, current number before I go on to So what do I do with the other insurance company because yeah, yeah, OK.
[26 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Whether you cancel it now, whether it's in, you know, a year, 2 years, three years, four years, it's up to you, right? I can't, it's, it's hard. I've got to be very careful about what I advise and, and when, as I said, the only thing I can advise is that if you are replacing it with this policy, we recommend that you do not cancel it. Don't cancel it until you've received and reviewed everything in full. That's anything. OK. That's all I can really tell you.
[27 minutes][Customer] : OK, Yeah, OK.
[27 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : But yeah, if, if you need to do something with that one, just give them a call. They can walk you through it. Yeah.
[27 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK.
