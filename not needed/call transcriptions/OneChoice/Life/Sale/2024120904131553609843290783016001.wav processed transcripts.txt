Obviously you'd be able to protect your mortgage if something happened to you, you know your husband will be able to have that money there. Now the process is really, really easy. So what we do is we go through everything with you over the phone, like literally from start to finish. And what it is, is it we ask some questions about your health and your lifestyle and that will determine the final outcome.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, yeah, sure.

[4 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll pop that in there. So 100,000 is the minimum that you can look at to be insured for. The maximum that you can go up to is $2,000,000.
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : It's nothing.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So starting at 100,000, going up to $2,000,000, it starts at 100 and goes up at 50,000 all the way up. So what amount would you like to have a look at? How much do you think you'd like?
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : I am actually planning for the Max.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, 2,000,000, Yeah, let's have a look at that for you. No problem. And so every fortnight and $2,000,000 indicatively at this stage you would pay, it'll be $73.25 a fortnight.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's perfect.

[19 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes it was.
[19 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK. And this is very normal that I'm asking you these questions. It just happens, you know, these these are normal procedure for us all. OK, that's fine. That's all I need on that. So we're moving on to the next one now. Other than what you have already told me about, are you contemplating seeking medical advice for any symptoms you're currently experiencing within the next two weeks? Yes, so it's just asking you just say now we've already chatted about you know that when you had that faint that that Lightheadedness. So O are your low blood pressure. So other than other than that, other than what you have already told me about OK. Are you contemplating? So you're thinking about seeking? Are you contemplating thinking? Are you contemplating seeking medical advice for any symptoms you are currently experiencing within the next two weeks?
[19 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : That's that mean I'm I'm planning for any medical checkup or no. I'm great actually.
[20 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, good, good. And you sound healthy, that's for sure. Now we're on a family history. We're just about done now. The family history 1 is to the best of your knowledge, this is OK. Have any of your immediate family and that's going to mean your mom, your dad, your brothers and your sisters. Now either they are living or they are deceased. Ever been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, Huntington's disease or familial at the moment as polyposis To the best of your knowledge have any of your immediate family suffered from cancer, heart condition, stroke or other her registry disease prior to age 60?
[20 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[21 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK. And your very last question being now other than one off events like gift certificate or vouchers, do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fair paying passenger on a recognized airline, Motor racing, parachuting, mountain earring, AB sailing, scuba diving deeper than 40 meters, cave or wreck diving or any other hazardous activity? OK. And let me submit this for you and I'll let you know. So are you satisfied with the answers provided? Exception that we'll now lock the application.
[21 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : No, absolutely great, but that is one more question. I was actually going to pay a life insurance for my husband as well.
[21 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, well what we'll do is let me explain how now the next step for you and then we'll chat about hubby then as well.
[21 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : No.
[21 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem at all. So now based in reference to your health and lifestyle answers with those answers, what I need to do for you is I need your application. I need need to be referred to the underwriter for assessment. Very, very normal procedure. Now, the reason why it is, is because you had that bit of low blood pressure about a year ago because you're we're overworked and hot and so on. So normal. And it just so happens that I've got a list, you see, and sometimes there's things on the list and sometimes there isn't. If something's not on the list, we refer it. So that's why I'm doing this for you. So the underwriters, they just have a look at it, all the notes that I've got there and they come back to me. What happens then is if it's approved, this policy will cover you for deaths due to any cause except suicide in the 1st 13 months, OK? There's already what's called a terminally ill advanced payment. It's already included in this cover for you. So what that really means is if you sadly were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay the whole claim out to you in full. If you get that whole amount of money, you do not have to give it back. If you go into remission, it's yours to keep.
[22 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[23 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, now there is what's called a loading be added now, which means the premium has risen. So we'll have a look at that and you can let me know if it still suits. The loading is due to BMI, so we'll have a look at that new price now and see if it suits you. We can always go down a bit if it's a bit much for you. So please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means that we generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount, which is actually Rosemary, the amount that you're insured for it will in increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. And you can opt out of this indexation each year if you want to. OK, So you can actually at time in your life W if you wanted to grow great, you can, but you don't have to. You can opt out of the indexation each year if you want to, if you're satisfied with what you have. Some years you think I don't need any more, that's fine. You just Y you opt out of the indexation. OK, so now if you want the 2 million because of that increase with that loading, it would now go to a fortnightly premium of $109.87 per fortnight.
[23 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, not a problem yet.
[24 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK now what we can do is what I can is I can do like a pre set up for you where I go ahead get your payment details. You choose the date you want the first payment to come out on. I read your declaration and go ahead and get it assessed by the underwriter. Are you happy to proceed with that?
[24 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sure.
