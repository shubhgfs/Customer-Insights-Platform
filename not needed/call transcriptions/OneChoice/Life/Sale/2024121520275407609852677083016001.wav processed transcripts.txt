[2 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I paid that one, Yeah.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So our funeral insurance, of course, both insurances are designed to pay out in the events of yourself passing away. With the funeral insurance that's more designed to take care of some of those more immediate and upfront expenses such as those funeral costs or any expenses that they need to be taken care of right away. With the life insurance that once more designed to take care of some of the bigger long term expenses such as unpaid bills or anything else that may need to be taken care of there. OK.
[3 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : But in terms of this one here, in terms of this one here, you more so your more your main concern is more so just the funeral expenses or you're wanting to leave extra money left fine for your loved ones. What is it that you're sort of looking at doing?

[3 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Well, look, I can I can take you both through both our life and our funeral insurance. How does that sound?
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yes. Oh, what?
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that way you can, you can see how much each cover work costs and how each cover works there for yourself. So let's go through the life insurance. First off, their race. So First off and foremost, when it comes to our life insurance, it is designed to provide you with that little bit of Peace of Mind that if something happens to yourself, your family are going to have that little bit of financial security. Now we actually pay this money out to your chosen beneficiary as a lump sum payment and you can up to five people to receive this money in that instance.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So they could use that money for whatever they need. So whether it's helping them do something like as simple as just sort of maintain their lifestyle or they can use it to help them take care of any outstanding expenses, whether that be unpaid bills, mortgages, loans or any other costs involved in raising their family, the choice, it is entirely up to your loved ones.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm. Yeah.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : I'm not actually going to tell them how to spend a sense of this money now at the time of your chosen beneficiary is making a claim their race They're also they're also able to request an advanced payout of $10,000 to help photo for some of those more immediate and upfront expenses that may need to be taken care of right away. OK, perfect. So it's just like you through a little bit of pricing for our life insurance. I do need to ask, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm. Yep.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : No. Fantastic. Thank you so much for that. Now the level of cover we can look at for yourself when it comes to life cover starts at $100,000 being the lowest, up to a maximum of $500,000 being the highest, and we're back in $50,000 increments. So from 100 it goes to 152, hundred, 250 and so on up to that maximum of 500,000. What amount would you like to look at the 100,000?
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, the small one, the smallest one, probably.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yep, perfect. So if we were to look at $100,000 worth of our life covered their rate, you're looking at an indicative fortnightly payment of $62.45. So it's $62.45 per fortnight. How does that sound to you?
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it sounds OK.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Did you want to look at any other amounts?
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : No, yeah, the second would probably be OK.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Are we happy around that 100,000 perfect mm? Hmm.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : When, when would I have to start it? After Christmas or the end of the year.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So what's this? So what's this one here? What the next step is, is taking you through the house and lifestyle application so we can determine your eligibility for the cover. Umm, that way they were able to let you know First off if there's gonna be any changes made to that pricing and of course exactly what type of cover we're able to offer you. From there, I can go through and let you know the process of how we get the cover set up. Of course, we can't get cover set up without any upfront payments and upfront costs. We just select down a preferred payment date and payment method that is suitable for you in the near future. OK, So what we'll do now is we'll go through the health and lifestyle application and then we can look at what how we're going to go with getting this one set up and when you'd like sort of like their first payment to be OK, perfect.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, sorry.

[15 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no anxiety. Anxiety sometimes.
[16 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. We'll answer yes to that one. And it's been just asked in the last five years, have you been admitted to sorry? Have you let me reread that? In the last five years, have you attempted suicide or been hospitalized for a mental health condition? Perfect. Now the next question there is, have you been diagnosed with or currently undergoing testing for, UH, as a doctor advised you to be tested for mononeuron disease or any form of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Perfect. Thank you so much for that. OK.
[16 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : No, no, Oh no.
[17 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So sorry, so have you been diagnosed with or currently undergoing testing for or has the doctor advised you to be tested for motor neuron disease or any form of dementia including Alzheimer's disease?
[17 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : The first word you said.
[17 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, thank you so much for that. So that's actually all the questions I do need to ask you there raised. So first of all, for most, I do want to let you know a big congratulations, your application for a life cover. It has been approved. Now this is subject to the following terms and conditions. So at this current, at this current stage, we are able to offer you a benefit amount of $50,000 being the lowest up to a maximum of $100,000 being the highest. And this does come with a policy term of 20 years.
[18 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[18 minutes][Agent] : So what that means for yourself is during the first 12 months of this policy, we would cover you for accidental death only. And then after the first 12 months, you would be covered for death due to any cause, whether that they have an accident or natural causes there. After the first year, you are fully covered now. Well, sorry, let me rephrase that.
[18 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[18 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So for the 1st 12 months, we cover you for accidental death only and then after the first 12 months, we will cover you for this due to any cause again, whether that be of an accident or natural causes.
[18 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[18 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : However, it is important to note that suicide is not covered within the 1st 13 months of the policy. OK, now with this one here as well, right, So you also include with our cover it's similarly ill advanced payment. So let's touch with nothing corporal like that was to happen. But if you were unfortunately after holding your policy in place for 12 months, if you were unfortunately diagnosed with a terminal illness and given 12 sorry if you're diagnosed with 12 months at least to live by a medical practitioner, we're going to pay your claim out to you in full. So we pay this out to whilst you're still living and what you choose to spend that money on, it is entirely up to yourself there. So it can be used for any upcoming treatment costs or spending extra time with loved ones. Taking off a bucket list the choice, it is entirely up to yourself on how you choose to spend any of that money there. OK, so with that being said, based on the application outcome for the $100,000 worth of cover, that is now working out to be $168.74 per fortnight. So it's 16874 per fortnight. Does that still sound affordable for you? Did you want to, did you want to maybe look at reducing it down a little bit more to see if it's a bit more affordable for you?
[19 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, Yeah, it could be, umm, give me a minute.
[20 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. That's OK.
[20 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : At the moment, yeah.
[20 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So we can we can go down to 75 or 50,000. I understand at the moment you're not working. So it's about finding something that suits the budget. So if we bring it down to 50,000, that's the lowest level of cover that when we're able to offer you for $50,000 worth of our life cover, you'll be looking, looking at a fortnightly payment of $84.73. So it's $84.73 per fortnight and that's on $50,000 worth of cover. Of course, that still includes the advanced payouts of $10,000 at the time of your loved ones making a claim there. How does it, uh, how does that 50,000 sound?
[20 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Does that sound better suited for the budget or is it still a little bit outside?
[21 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : That's not elections, OK.
[21 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So in terms of this one here, I also want to let you know with your life cover, please be aware that your premium is set. So what that means is that will generally increase each year. In addition, this policy has what's called an automatic indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 2% with associated increases in premium. And of course, if you can opt out of this indexation each year, so each year around policy anniversary, we'll actually send you out a letter saying this is what your new sum insured is going to be, what's associated increases in premium. And you can of course opt out of that one each year.
[21 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[21 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So what I'm actually able to do for yourself today on that $50,000 policy is I'm actually able to give you that little bit of Peace of Mind and that little bit of financial security by getting some cover set up and in place today without any upfront payments or upfront costs. What we actually do is we note down a preferred payment day and payment method that is suitable for you in the near future. From there, I read you out a quick declaration and I organize getting then you sent out all your precise policy documents to review. I actually send you out 2 copies. So I send you out an e-mail copy. That one's generally within the next hour or so, and then I also send you out a postal copy. That postal copy takes around about 5 to 10 business days. That way there you can sit down, take your time and review those documents and have that little bit of Peace of Mind that you have got some cover in place. Now I also want to let you know this policy he does give you what's called a 30 day calling off. So if you decide to cancel within those 30 days, you'll actually receive a full refund of any premiums you may have paid. This is of course unless a claim has been made. So the next two clear races I do need to get your address there please starting with your post code. That's OK, I can look your address up manually there. What is your address please?

[23 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : 720 Yep.
[23 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Thank you so much for that. So in terms of the sign here race, what we've been now is we're gonna note down that the first payment date. So of course, we're not gonna take any payments off you today. We are just gonna note down a payment date that's suitable for you in the near future. And saying that though, as a business, we do generally like to try and collect payment within the next 7 days. However, we would actually be more suitable for you. Yeah. So you let me know what day you'd like the first payment to come out and I'll let you know if I can select that day.
[24 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Well, it's Christmas, can be that positive saying no, probably after Christmas.
[24 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's, that's OK. So you let me know what day you'd like that to be and I'll let you know if I can select that day because I can push it back a little bit if need be.
[24 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Oh my God, have a remind me. You pick one.
[24 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : I can't, I can't pick a day for you. Is there a day that you usually get paid on that you'd like it to follow on Tuesday? OK.

[25 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Do you get paid fortnightly or weekly?
[25 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Weekly.

[25 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that sounds good.
[25 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Perfect. So we can make this cover start today with the first payments of $84.37, come out on Tuesday the 7th, and then it'll be every second Tuesday thereafter.

[25 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So what we're going to do now raises, they're going to note down that payment method. So we do this very securely over the phone by one of two simple options. So the first is either by a Visa debit, Visa MasterCard or credit card, or the second is by a bank account number for a direct debit. What 1 sounds more suitable for you?
[25 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : What was it? Visa card one maybe I've got one of those.
