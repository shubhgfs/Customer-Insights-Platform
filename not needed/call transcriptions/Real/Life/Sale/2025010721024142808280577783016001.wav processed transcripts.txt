I, I, I do apologize yesterday I actually finished at 4:00 PM. So I'm doing the early shift today again, I start at 8 till 4:00. So I just got that message from Joel that he spoke with you yesterday. So I called you first thing this morning. So I appreciate the call back, Steven. Thank you for that. Umm, because we had originally spoken together, uh, about a week or so. Now I do of course recognize, umm, I've got your quote up here, but because it's a new call, sorry to be a pain. I know Cam's already confirmed your details as well, but could I just get you to reconfirm just your name and date of birth, please?
[40 seconds][Customer] : Not a problem.
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Cheers, Steve. And of course you're a male and an Australian resident, of course.

[1 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Not a problem.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, cheers. Now Joel had umm given me the rundown that yesterday when he spoke to you that you were possibly wanting to look at a lower amount of possibly $250,000 to cover UMM, and he managed to bring up the quote there for you. Umm, just wanted to double check to see umm, uh, W were you happy with that amount that it worked out for you? Did you possibly want to look at something else?
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm happy with the quote.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : I think it was 100 and 68186 a month or something.
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'll bring it back up for you now. In fact, what I'll do is we'll recap OO on the life insurance because again, it was a week or so that that we spoke. So I'll just recap the main key points and we'll take it from there. And if you're happy with it, then we'll go through the application, find out your eligibility. OK Cheers, Steven. Thanks a lot, Sir. Umm, uh, BU, but again, umm, just to refresh my memory from last week, umm, this is new for you. You don't currently have any existing cover in place at the moment though, is that right?
[1 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Not a problem, just my e-mail, see.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Got you. And, and will you possibly if I, if you're happy with this and you do get accepted, were you looking at this as a secondary policy or maybe to replace your MLC cover?
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : But I don't know if that's part of Yeah, and that's yeah, secondary policy.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. Well, either way, it's up to you what you want to do. Of course, only reason we ask because if you are replacing, we just recommend not to cancel out your existing insurance as yet until the application with us has been approved and you've reviewed the policy in full first says Steven, That's all. As it may not be identical to your existing insurance should also consider the benefits that may not apply the waiting piece to miss out again. But if you're looking at it as a secondary policy, that's fine. No worries.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Not a problem, not a problem.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : And, and cheers and I'll just ask again. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? That's OK. All good?
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yes, like I've cut down to one a day.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Nice. Good for you. Well, I'm a smoker myself. I know how hard it is to to quit or even cut down. So hats off to you. Maybe one day we'll we'll both get there and and quit all together. Now if you recall that this is designed to obviously pay out that lump sum to your family or your beneficiaries when you pass. They can use the money however they wish and to apply for it. There's no medical checks or doctor's appointments. We'll just need to ask you a couple of questions over the phone. They're just simple yes or no answer questions regarding your health and your answers will determine your eligibility.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Not a problem.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now once we go to the questions, I'll let you where at the end if you have been approved or, or not, or if there's been any changes to your quote. Because based on your answers or your medical history, umm, the, uh, application, the, the, the quote can change and your terms and conditions could possibly change as well, all based on your medical history. OK, cheers. Now, umm, uh, based on your age at the time, we can you, you could have chosen any amount you like between, umm, $100,000 a cover as a minimum. From there on it goes up to a maximum of $1,000,000 cover. So just double checking with the quote that Joel worked out yesterday at 250,000 that did come to a, umm, uh, sorry, he quoted you as a monthly, is that right? You prefer monthly payments, do you?
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Not a problem, correct?
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Sure, no worries. Yeah, I'll change that to monthly now. Did he actually take you through the application process? He didn't as yet, did he?
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No, not yet.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Got you? Yeah, sure, no worries. So what we can do then for you is if you were happy with the 250,000, let's firstly find out your eligibility. I'll take you to these medical questions now and ensure that you do get accepted their statement.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Not a problem.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, thank you Sir. Umm, I just need to, umm, if it's alright with you so I can load up these questions. Just put in an address on your profile, if that's alright. Uh, could we start with your post code and suburbs?

You just had Steph instead of Steve. So I've fixed that up for you now. So it's steve.barnett46@yahoo.com. Got it. Cheers, Steve. Sorry for the muck around. That's probably why you probably didn't get did. Did you get the e-mail that y'all sent off to yesterday? Because he he would would've sent it to that address mostly.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I have. I haven't actually had a look.

[14 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : No, Nope.
[14 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Awesome Steve. So that's it for the medical section. Now I've got 2 questions regarding your immediate family and this is only referring to your mum, dad, brothers and sisters only. Please don't include any other family members besides them. OK, cheers. So it reads to the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family, living or deceased, ever been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, Huntington's disease, or familial unanimous polyposis? And to the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family suffered from cancer, heart conditions, stroke, or other hereditary disease prior to age 60, not afterwards. Yeah, again, mom, dad, brothers and sisters before the age of 60. Just making sure. Is that right? No worries. That's OK. Sorry to hear.

[16 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : I'm the same, but like might be living the ground, that's for sure. Well, well, Steve, thank you so much for your time and patience. That was the last question. I'll go ahead and bring up your results for you right away. Just wanna clarify and reconfirm that you are satisfied with all the answers you've given me today.
[16 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, yes.
[17 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Great, awesome. So let's have a quick look at your results and give me one second. Won't be long.
[17 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Not a problem.
[17 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Cheers, Steven. OK, so as expected, not surprising. You are very healthy, man, as I mentioned earlier, based on your medical history and well done. Congratulations. You have been approved for this insurance policy.
[17 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[17 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, no worries. So this will in fact cover you for death due to any cause at all. The only thing that you're not covered for is the suicide in the 1st 13 months. That's the only exclusion, OK, I in addition will they'll also be another benefit, which of course I'm hoping you never get to use called the terminally ill advanced payment, but great piece of my knowing it is included for you just in case. This means that if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less delivered by medical practitioners fees, we we will then pay out the full $250,000 cover to you, not to your family, but to you before you've passed away. So you can actually use the money yourself, take care of your medical expenses or take off your bucket list or whatever you need to do with that money.
[18 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[18 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. Now keep in mind though, that with this, umm, with that said, umm, there has been a change to the quote. So based on your disclosure in the height and weight section due to your BMI, there has been a change to the cost of the insurance, which means your premium has risen. OK, I'll let you know what it's risen to there Steve, and you can let me know what your thoughts are. We obviously wanna make sure that it will still be suitable and affordable for you while giving you that extra buffet to your existing insurance. So you got that little bit of extra cover to to do what you what you want it to do. OK, umm. So again, don't be shy. If you feel it's too high for you, we can always bring it down.
[18 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Not a problem.
[18 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Maybe look at 200,000 if you wanted to to to compensate on that Tuesday, but it's loading up here for you now. So at the moment, if you were still happy to stay with the $250,000 cover per month, you're looking at a total monthly premium of $139 exactly per month.
[19 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : It's dropped a hell of a lot.
[19 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm it it's dropped has it? Did you say, oh sorry, you are correct, my apologies, Steven. Umm, I actually press the wrong button. Sorry, you you you are correct. Sorry. Let me adjust that. Sorry about this.
[19 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Not a problem. I should have kicked my mouth out.
[19 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I noticed. I noticed as soon as you mentioned that I noticed the error that I made Sorry about that.
[19 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[19 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So it's just check it's I'm just fixing it up now almost done. It just takes another minute. Now while that's loading up as well, I want to remind you that with this policy as well, you will receive a few additions that we add on top. Firstly, have you set up your will?
[19 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Not a problem, no, but we are in the process of it.
[20 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Oh, well, you you'll actually get a brand new one fully legalized with this insurance for free. It'll come with your policy documents.
[20 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[20 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, now. Here we go. So there was an error that happened in the underwriting section it where it's not showing your height and weight for some reason. So I'll just jump back in there and we'll fix that up. So could I just re ask you again? Sorry, off memory I believe that your exact height was 6 feet exact, is that right? Yep. And the weight off memory, I believe it was 120 kilos exact. Is that also correct?
[20 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Correct, correct.
[20 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Cheers. Thank you. Yep, thank you. So I'm just adding that back in. I don't know why that's the first time that's happened where it's removed that. That was very strange. Cheers for understanding. Sorry for the for the trouble there. OK, so now it should work. Sorry to keep you waiting there Steve. Almost done just for understanding, just making sure that all the other questions are the same as well, which they are. Yep, perfect. Just making sure of that because yeah, I don't know why that that removed the height and weight all together from the application. That was very strange.
[21 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK, I'm a unique person.
[21 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I've been doing this for seven years and this is Lis. This is literally the first time that's ever happened. So umm, yeah, that was umm, but I've just double checked all your questions. Yeah, they're all the same. Perfect. It was just the heightened weight that got removed. So there we go. Now it picks it up for you and here we go now. So again, based on your disclosure in the heightened weight section, due to your BMI, the loading has applied, which has risen your monthly premium. So at the moment for 250,000, you're looking at 318300 and $18.15 a month in total. Yeah.
[22 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sorry. What was it, 300 and 300?
[22 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So again, that is based on your disclosure, the high now, uh, 318300 and $18.15 a month now, again, that is based on the 250,000. What I do just wanna bring to your attention though, Steve, is that loading is obviously not locked in stone. Obviously the BMI can change should it change in the future. You can always call back and always apply to have it reviewed with U, with us in the future.
[22 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[22 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Umm, So keep that in mind, OK? Umm, but at this stage, I understand that obviously it's not the same amount that we had looked at originally or that you'll be added, even quoted you yesterday as well. But umm, having that said, you are still fully approved. Now, would you prefer to maybe look at something a bit lower at this stage to have that security that there's a little bit of an extra buffer on top of your MLC policy?
[23 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Actually, no, I think that works out to be roughly about the same as what Joel quoted me. I think I might have calculated wrong.
[23 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Oh, oh, did it. OK, sure.
[23 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : I can't remember.
[23 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Well, well, at the end of the day, would it be manageable for you or do you wanna maybe see what it is at 200,000 just to see the difference?
[23 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : No, that's fine.
[23 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : That's still manageable for you.
[23 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[23 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Awesome, awesome. So as I mentioned, umm, I, if you're in the midst of organizing your will, fair enough, but you'll actually get a fully legal will with this policy, absolutely free. It's valued at $160.00 and it's all done online through a company called Safe Will.
[23 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Mm, Hmm.
[23 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : It's really simple and you can actually do it yourself. Once you get the documents, it'll come for free for you.
[23 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[23 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Secondly, let your family know, Steve, that when the time comes and you do pass away, even though this is a life insurance policy, there is a funeral component attached to your insurance.
[24 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep.
[24 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So let you, yeah, remind them that we can pay out in advance 20% of your benefit amount to a maximum of $20,000 to take care of your funeral expenses. That's all included with this insurance for you.
[24 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Mm Hmm.
[24 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : And one last thing, once you hold our life insurance with us for a year, just as a thank you for being loyal and sticking it out with us for the 12 months, 50 following your policy anniversary, we'll refund you back 10% of all the payments you paid into it. So you'll get back a total refund from us of $381.78 just to sticking it out with us for a year.
[24 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[24 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, PE Perfect. And finally, I also need to make sure you understand that with this insurance, your premium is step, which means it will generally increase each year. Umm, uh, uh, from their own state. But umm, as you may be aware, with inflation and everything getting more and more expensive as we get older to keep up with the rising cost of living, what we're actually gonna offer you, and this is your choice, by the way, it's optional. But each year you will be offered to increase your life insurance amount by 5% each year just to keep up with the rising cost of living.
[25 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : No. Perfect.
[25 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : But again, you don't have to accept that increase if you don't need it. It's, it's optional.
[25 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[25 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So be aware that, umm, this policy has automatic indexation, which means that each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associate increases in premium, umm, until you reach the maximum benefit amount or until the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday. But again, you can opt out this automatic indexation each year if you didn't want to accept it, It's your choice.
[25 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : No.
[25 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Now to be, uh, completely transparent with you. I'll also give you an indication of what the cost will be next year if you decided to accept that 5% increase, just so you can see the difference. We actually have a, a premium projection tool, which actually SH shows us the, the costings. I'll load it up for you. Now.
[25 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[25 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : It just states here that the premium projections are indicative only Steve, and they assume you don't make any changes to your cover. Umm. So for next year as an indication, if you make no changes to your policy and you did decide to accept that 5% increase on your insurance, your life insurance next year will grow to 262,500 and then the monthly cost will then increase the $372.61 a month next year if you decided to accept that 5% increase. OK, I understand how that works.
[26 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : So, yeah, so basically each year it's a 5% increase, the insurance policy goes up as well, the L the policy actually increases.
[26 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Because obviously with your age as you're getting older, the, the generally speaking, of course can't speak for everybody, but generally the older we get, the more likely we are to claim on the insurance. So the risk, the risk is greater and that's why the cost gets more expensive as we get all the, based on our age, they're saved. Umm, but at the same time, umm, we with inflation, uh, so that's why we do give you that option. If you wanted to increase your insurance by 5%, umm, So if you accept that 5% increase, your, your premium next year will be greater because you'd be covered for that extra 5%, OK. But either way, your premium will increase each year due to your age. OK, we will notify you generally about a month before the policy ends saying hey see becomes about to end the next couple of weeks. This is what the cost would be for next year if you decide to accept the 5% or not. And then you can choose what you wanna do. And you can also find information about up instruction on the website as well.
[27 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : No, OK, not the problem.
[27 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Umm, But if you're happy with that, Steve, again, congratulations. Now that you've been approved, what I'll arrange is I'll get you covered immediately.
