[1 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, thank you. I get you. Yeah, that's fair. So just thinking about that just in case sort of what if scenario, that sort of thing. Sure.
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, not a problem at all. Well, thanks for letting me know. Umm, yeah, basically that's pretty much exactly what the life insurance is designed for, just to provide that bit of financial protection for your loved ones to a lump sum payment if you were to pass away.
[2 minutes][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes][Agent] : So essentially the idea being is that it's there to give you that bit of Peace of Mind that if anything did happen to yourself, your children or beneficiaries would still have that financial security to fall back on just in case.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, you can nominate up to five people as beneficiaries. So if you had a few people in mind and you'd like to leave money to, you can definitely do that. But at the end of the day, it's completely up to you where the money goes.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Uh, it's also a worldwide cover, so even if you do travel overseas, you'll still be covered and it also includes an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount just to up, I'm sorry, 20% of the benefit amount up to a maximum of $20,000 just to help out with funeral costs or any other final expenses when that time comes.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Now it does also include a terminally ill advanced payment, which, uh, fingers crossed, hopefully you'll never need to use, but it is there just in case. Now, because we're a direct insurer, the application process is pretty simple. It's basically just a few health and lifestyle questions over the phone. So there's no medical checks or blood tests or anything like that. And the answers to those health and lifestyle questions will determine the final pricing and the terms of the policy. But I'll have a look at some quotes so I can let you know how much it costs. Just have to confirm a couple of details. Firstly, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine. No problem. Alrighty. So based on your current age, the level of cover that you can choose from starts at $100,000 up to a maximum of 1,000,000. Umm, what amount would you like me to look at first?
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : The top one.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So once, so we'll get the 1,000,000, we can always drop it down if need be.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Uh, let's say you're looking at a cover of $1 million for yourself, works out to be a fortnightly premium of $310.10. So it's about $155 a week.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : And yeah, that would pay $1 million to your family or beneficiaries if you passed away or $1 million to yourself if you were diagnosed terminally ill.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : But, umm, realistically speaking, does that sound like something that would suit your situation or do we look at some other amounts as well?
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, that would be.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : That'd be OK. OK, sure.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Well, I'll leave it at the $1 million for now. Uh, the next step in the process is we like to quickly go through those health and lifestyle questions so that we could let you know if you are eligible or if there'd be any changes to those terms and conditions. Then if you're approved and if you're happy to, I can organize to send you out all the documentation so that you can take some time to read through it in your own time. Just make sure that you're happy with it.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Umm, yeah, they're pretty much just yes or no questions. I won't take much of your time, but I just wanna make sure I'm doing the right thing by you. Is that all making sense for you so far? Yeah, perfect. OK, I just have to read out a pre underwriting disclosure. So this basically explains why we ask these questions. Which is, is it?

Perfect, thanks very much. Alrighty, well, that's you for all the questions. Umm, just before I close that off, I just want to make sure I've captured everything correctly. I'm just going back to originally when you said yes to the kidney condition. So I just want to clarify. So originally you thought it was a kidney condition, but it turns out that it wasn't. It was just a CIS, is that right? Yeah, that's fine. So you didn't actually have a kidney condition. All right.
[15 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : No, it yes, right, right.
[16 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. That's fine. Easy. Thanks very much. Alrighty, well, thank you for all the answers. Are you satisfied with the answers you provided?
[16 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yes, ma'am. Yeah.
[16 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Look, no surprises. Obviously you are very healthy. So you have been fully approved. Umm, so now that your application has been approved, I can confirm the terms of the policy. So the great thing is there were no price changes. Uh, that's all stayed the same. Uh, this policy will now cover you for deaths due to any cause at all. The only thing that's not covered is just suicide in the 1st 13 months. Uh. In addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover, which means that if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, in that case, we would pay out your claim in full while you're living. Now the other part to keep in mind in regards to the premium. So your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year.
[16 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[17 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premiums until you reach the maximum benefit amount or until the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, but it is optional. You can opt out of this automatic indexation each year if you wish. Now I've got a projection here, so I'll just quickly give you an indication of what that looks like. This is here as an indication. If you make no changes to the policy next year, if you accept that 5% increase, your amount insured would increase to $1,050,000 and the fortnightly premium would then be $361.38.
[17 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[17 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : You can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well, so.
