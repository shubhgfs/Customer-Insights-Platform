Now, just before we jump into it, I'll need to let you know because it is a new call. All calls are recorded and any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. And could you please help me out by reconfirming your name and date of birth? Thank you so much. And since we had uh spoken yesterday, I am just required to confirm with you again.

[49 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. And has anything changed in terms of the health questions we run through yesterday?
[55 seconds][Customer] : No, no changes.
[56 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic. So the last quote that we looked at for you was for the $300,000 and this was for $116.12 per month, which is about $3.83 per day.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yes. If I get 400,000, how much would be the deduction? 154 and 84 monthly. I I have a question, do you have a, an insurance that is packaged with health insurance like the disability we have insurance like that or is a separate insurance?
[1 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : So is that still suitable for you or do you want me to look at another level of cover 400,000 that would be $154.82 per month yeah no health insurance is a separate insurance.
[1 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : OK? So I will I think I will go, I will get the 300,000.
[1 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a problem. We could do that for you now, uh, with.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : So this is this is for how many years I will have to pay?
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So this one is a a whole of life cover Rd. So as long as you want to keep it up to date, we can ensure you for the rest of your life. You just have to maintain the payments. In saying that though, you can cancel it at any time if you would like to and the cover will stop, but there's no savings or investment elements. So if you do cancel it after the initial 30 day cooling off. Then you don't receive any money back. OK.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Do you have other like suggestion or recommendation insurance aside from the life insurance? Because I'm looking for insurance with the like. Like with the with I don't know how to how to explain it like like a premium that after like when you did 75 years you are insured. Like is there insurance like that in your company?
[3 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Like a maturity sort of thing.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : No, we don't have any sort of maturity thing. I know that is prevalent in a lot of Asian countries. That's not something that we have here.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. So this is but I can stop this anytime if I want, right?
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it it's, yeah, that's correct. And anytime you could cancel it, that's up to you.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : So if I miss one payment, that means I'm not insured?
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : No, no, no, of course not. We have a customer support team, customer care team who will speak with you and see if this is something that obviously you would like to continue on with and we can reschedule it. Missing one payment doesn't necessarily mean that your policy is gonna end straight away. Awesome. OK, awesome. Now when we spoke last night you said that you would be fined for the payments to fall on the 25th of the month. Is that still suitable for you?
