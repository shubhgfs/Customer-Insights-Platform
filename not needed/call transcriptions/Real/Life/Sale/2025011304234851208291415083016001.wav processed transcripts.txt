[3 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Umm, So we'll cover for yourself firstly here, just so please let our calls are recorded and any advice we provide general in nature may not be suitable for your situation. Sandra, what's sparked the interest of looking into the live coverage today?
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : By law, we have to have one because I'm working, he's working, and I know that if we don't have one, I think I would have to pay something. I don't know. That's why my accountant saying we must have insurance policy, because by law we must have one.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, alright, no problem. Well, look, I'll explain to you how it all works.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : So, yeah, I don't know if you know that one. Do you know about that? I think, OK, well, I think you, well you might have your own too. And if by law that you must have it and once you have to pay at the end of the year, I think they pay $500 or or $2000. No, that your business, your company we work for pay 1500 and we pay 500 something like that or that. MM, Hmm.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : No, I don't say OK, OK, OK, fair enough. OK, Alright, well, look what I'll do. I'll explain to you how it all works and we can run through the pricing. And if you have any questions along the way, just stop me.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I'll let you know. Firstly, it is very simple in how the life coverage works.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So at the end of the day, it's designed to provide financial protection for your loved one in the event that the cut would something was happen to yourself.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Now the way that we do that is through a lump sum payment.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. Mm, hmm. Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : The cover does also include a terminally ill advanced payment, which means if you were diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a registered medical practitioner, sorry, with 24 months or less to live by a registered medical practitioner will pay the claim that it will in that situation. So you can get the best medical care or anything else you might need as well. There's also a funeral component built in.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So because funerals do tend to be the most immediate expense in your loved ones in the event that something was to happen, we actually do a 20% advance payout to cover those costs generally paid out within 24 to 48 hours of the claim being made. So it's really designed to give your loved ones immediate access to that money there. Uh, up to a Max of $40,000 as well.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, The cover's not a guaranteed acceptance. Not everyone is eligible for it. Now, we don't expect you to go through any medical checks, no blood tests, nothing like that. Instead, we just take you through a series of simple yes and no help lifestyle questions over the phone. And then if you are expected and once you decide to commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK, now we'll run through the pricing here. Can I just ask firstly Sandra, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yes, no, I know it's not enough.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And how much would you be looking to cover yourself for? What do you think?
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : I don't know for how much I can I can what is. I don't know how this works, see. So I have no idea about nothing.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : So I don't know if you can explain and this is possible. That is not possible. This and that. This is how much it will cost. This is per week. This is the month or whatever it is.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Well, we, we, we can cover you from, yeah, we can cover you from $100,000 up to $1,000,000 depending on your personal needs. Umm, So the price is going to be dependent on how much you're actually looking to cover if something happens. So it, it works the way that I explained a moment ago, it's designed to leave money behind to your loved ones if something happens to yourself.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Just guide me through mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : How much do you think you'd need to leave behind if something else happens?
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : I don't know. Oh my God, that's that's brand new for me. OK. Can you tell me how much you will cost me for 100 up to 1,000,000 and then I will see how much we can afford monthly 203 hundred, 405 hundred?
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Well, I mean, $100,000, yeah, $100,000 cover, it'd be $14.27 fortnightly.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK, Mm. Hmm. A fortnight.
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : If you did $1,000,000 cover, it'd be $142.66 fortnightly, correct. Yeah.
[7 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK, so that will be two hundred a month, No? How much? It will be a month?
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, about 280 amount roughly.
[7 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : 280 a minute.
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : That's for the maximum though.
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK, Uh huh. OK. What happened with UMM? OK, that would be OK for him. I think that would be good for him because he's getting umm a good money with him.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah, what a.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : So I mean it would be family anyway, would be him in mind. It wasn't coming out of one account anyway because my money, his money goes in my income. He thinks I'm going to one account, yes.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, How much do you feel like you'd be for yourself though? Like do you think that would be OK for yourself or did you want to look at a different amount for yourself?
[8 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : That would be 33600 a month. OK so wha what would be the acceptable thing?
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : What was that?
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Oh oh do you? How can I say? Did you say you have been affected for that amount or this amount or that amount or doesn't work like that?
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Say no. So we have to take you through health questions to see if you're actually eligible for it. At the moment, we're just looking at what the pricing would be for that amount. So based on your age, we can cover from 100,000 up to $1,000,000 for yourself. Yeah, correct. Yep.
[9 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : No, my age is 53, Yes. OK, Yeah, OK. Go ahead with that.
[9 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So do you think you'd be looking at the million?
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : You, you one question, one question. You get this in the money, you change it now in the tax return.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : What was that?
[9 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Do you get this money back in the tax return? I think you do.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, you'd have to, you'd have to speak to an accountant about that. I can't give you advice on taxes because maybe depending on your specific situation.
[9 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Every company knows that. You, you should know that the every, everyone who get it, who get insurance, get the they get it back in the money in the tax return. That's why My, my, that's why my, my, I can't say. God. MMM.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Fair enough. As I said, it may be dependent on your specific situation.
[10 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : That's why I can't give you advice on it because obviously some of you may not be able to get the money and money back on tax some. So I I'm not allowed to give advice on that, sorry.
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's OK. No, no, no, no. Why? But you should know that people do get it back in back the same. That's that's all I'm asking. Mm Hmm.
[10 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : As I said, because it might be based on your individual circumstances, though, not everyone may be able to be eligible to do that. That'll be completely up to us to look into that.
[10 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK, I know different what he told me. I think I need to call back to him before I go any further with this to my accountant because he told me he say this insurance is a tax you will find me in the tax.
