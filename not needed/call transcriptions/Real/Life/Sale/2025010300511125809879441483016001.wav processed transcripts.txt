[1 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[3 seconds][Agent] : Good morning. My name's Emily. I'm calling from Real Insurance, but I can give you a call to follow up on the online enquiry for the life insurance just before we continue. I need to. Sorry.
[13 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, Emily, like I did thinking about the Adelaide 3:00 time, is it your you got 3:00?
[21 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I do apologise about that. I'm not sure why it's come back to you already. I've booked that one in for you now.
[26 seconds][Customer] : But anyway, like in a year we can speak how long it will take.
[31 seconds][Agent] : It depends on like obviously how you answer our questions and things like that.
[34 seconds][Customer] : That's OK. You, you, you go ahead. Yeah.
[34 seconds][Agent] : To take you through a quote, it's OK. Well, so that I can take you through it, I need to let you know calls are recorded. Any advice to providers generally make sure they're not be suitable to your situation. And I'll get you to reconfirm your name and date of birth for me.
[50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Vivek Vishnu, Date of birth, 23rd of March 1980.
[56 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful.
[58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[56 seconds][Agent] : And you are of course a male Australian resident, is that right?
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Thank you. Now I did want to ask what's actually made you interested in getting life insurance for yourself?
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : It's just, you know, Yeah. I was just getting it through my own on the superannuation. Uh, but then I thought I should, uh, compare that, you know, and uh, what made me is, uh, you know, uh, the property por portfolio, you, you have the mortgage on different properties.
[1 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[1 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : You feel like, OK, at least, you know, you should have a backup. That's it.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely. Have that Peace of Mind that you've still got that, you know, financial security that'll help your family with things like the mortgage if something were to happen.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. Now you mentioned you were looking at your super, so were you wanting to pay it through your super? Is that what you were saying through or you're wanting to compare outside of super?
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Uh, actually, uh, I'm not sure like, you know, Ministry of Insurance does that, you know, paying to the Super.
[2 minutes][Agent] : Yes, yes. So that's why I wanted to ask because with our cover it's not something that you can't pay through like a a Superfund unless have you got a self managed Superfund or just a normal super OK.
[2 minutes][Customer] : But yeah, yeah, at the moment like I do have the my employer super, but like you know, I, I'm in the process of like, you know, arranging my estimates for in next three to six months.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem at all. So it's up to you to obviously decide what you want to have a look at because we do have a life insurance for a self managed Superfund or we have one that's done outside of a Superfund. So but it's specifically for self managed. So did you want to look at that cover or just a normal life insurance for now?
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So just I want to ask like you know or is that going to be a difference in the premium for different ones?
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So potentially there could be a difference in the premium and there could be a difference in what's actually covered under the policy as well.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK. So which one is gets more affordable and do you know having?
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Well, I mean keep them. So I mean it, it does depend because I, I can take you through quotes for both.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Sure, sure. We can do both, yeah.
[3 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Obviously keep in mind though, it's up to you to decide obviously what's more financially beneficial for you because yeah, so because obviously keep in mind one, you're paying through a self managed super fund, one you're paying out of your personal bank account. So it's obviously up to you to decide what is financially suitable for you.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : That's right.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Now, what we can do because you obviously don't have a self managed super fund at the moment. I'll take you through our life cover and explain a bit how that one works 1st and we can have a look at a quote.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's right.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : If you've got any questions as we're going through it, jump in, let me know. I'll be happy to help you out.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So with the life insurance, it is obviously designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. So that benefit can be used to help maintain their lifestyle, whether that is helping them pay off a mortgage or any loans or any other costs involved in raising a family. Now it's with this policy, there is an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount that's paid to assist, oh sorry, up to a maximum of $20,000 to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. This cover also has a terminally ill advanced payer included, and you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to actually receive the benefit amount. Now, Vivek, it is nice and simple. We just ask you some help with lifestyle questions over the phone. So there's no forms to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete. This will determine when we take you through those questions. It's gonna determine the pricing as well as the terms of the policy. But we'll start going through a bit of an indicative quote together. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Beautiful, that's really good to hear. It's definitely healthier for you and it generally works out cheaper on the insurance as well, which is always a plus. Now you can, sorry. I also need to confirm, is your current annual income $50,000 or more? No worries. And based on that you can choose an amount benefit about ranging from $100,000 up to a maximum of $2,000,000. What amount would you like me to quote you on to start with? 2 million. Beautiful. Either way, I'm happy to go through as many quotes as you need, so let me know how that maximum amount sounds. We can work our way down from there.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : No, yeah, 22 million, Yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : But for $2,000,000 of the life cover, including that terminally or benefit and the funeral advance payment, you'd be looking at a fortnightly premium of $174.91. Now, does that sound like something that would be affordable or did you want to have a look at some other amounts?
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, so, umm, what, uh, what about like, yeah, 1,000,000?
[6 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So if we looked at the 1,000,000, that's going to reduce that premium down to $87.45 a fortnight. Does that one sound maybe a little bit more suitable or did you want to look at a third option?
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : No, no, that's umm, that's all right. So, so umm, with the 1,000,000, if you can please, umm, advise me, uh, how, Yeah. What are the next things, you know, I need to consider? Yeah.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : The next steps, yeah, yeah, sure, of course. So the next step from here needs to actually take you to the health and lifestyle questions because the final price is actually determined on the outcome of this question. So we can go through those for you now. If you're approved, then we can discuss your options, where to go from there. Wha. There's a couple of things I just wanted to also let you know. So with this policy, Vivek, you do actually have a reward. So following your first policy anniversary date, we'll refund you 10% of the premiums you've paid in that time. So on this policy here, you've been looking at getting $227.38 back from us after the first year. I also wanted to ask, have you got an up to date will in place for yourself at the moment?
[7 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I know. I think I, yeah, I do need to make one. Yeah.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Great, Yeah, no worries. The reason I ask is because we'll actually provide you with a free online legal will valued at $160.00 with the policy. So if you want to use that to organise a will for yourself, you definitely can.
[7 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : So you're saying a free online bill?
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it's a free online legal will valued at $160.00, but that'll be sent through to your e-mail address. It'll come from a company called Safe Will. Now just before we go through the questions, I do need to grab your address. What's your post code? What was that?

[23 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[23 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So if you were diagnosed with 24 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we actually pay your benefit amount in full and that money can be used for your medical costs now based. So with this policy, your premium is stepped, which means it would generally increase each year. In addition, the policy has automatic indexation though, which means each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium until you reach the maximum benefit amount or until the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday. You can opt out of this automatic indexation each year though. Now, congratulations. In fact, you were fully approved for the cover, which is fantastic. So you're definitely very healthy. Now that you have been fully approved for the cover, just to confirm, it is still $87.45 per fortnight for the 1,000,000. What I want to do for you is also give you an idea of a premium projection, So what next year will actually look like for yourself, as in that's right.
[24 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : So, yeah, actually, yeah, I just got a question around you said like you know, I mean every year the premium will increase and also every year the sum insured will increase by 5% until 75th birthday. What is the maximum benefit amount?

[24 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK, right.
[24 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, but I'll give you an idea of what that's going to look like now. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $99 per fortnight, but that's if you do not decline the indexation, then your level of cover will be $1,050,000.
[25 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : That's for the next year.
[25 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : And yeah, that's right. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website. But the great news is, is that now that you have been fully approved for the cover, this actually allows us to get you covered over the phone today. What that would actually mean for you is that we'd get the proper policy documentation sent out. That way you can sit down, have a good read through to make sure obviously happy with everything to do with the cover, but you don't have to pay anything until the day you choose. If you end up looking through it and you change your mind for any reason, that's perfectly fine. There's no cancellation fees. You're not locked into this. I mean you actually have a 30 day cooling off. So if you cancelled within that 30 days, you get a full refund of any premiums you may have paid. Unless of course a claim has been made, but obviously touched with that's not going to be the case for a very, very long time.

[27 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Umm, as you mentioned, like I got 30 days to decide.
[27 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : So just to let you know, just to clarify there, Vivek, that 30 days you're referring to, that's the 30 day cooling off. Is that what you mean?

Umm, but I can't confirm.
[28 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : That's OK.
[28 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : I don't know whether it's something that they offer over at general insurance if you have, if you have multiple like general policies, but it's not something that we offer with life insurance in my home, for example.

Alternatively, by us still getting you covered from today's back, it means that we can actually send out your personalized policy documents for you to have a look through. Make sure you're happy with everything to do with your policy specifically. Like I mentioned, even though you're covered from today, you wouldn't have to pay anything until the day you choose.
