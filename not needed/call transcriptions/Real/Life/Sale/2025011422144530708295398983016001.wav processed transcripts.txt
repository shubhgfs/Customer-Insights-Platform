[1 seconds][Customer] : Hello.

[11 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah.
[12 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so I was going to take you through how the cover works. We'll go through the policy, we'll look at the pricing of everything. Feel free as well just to stop me anytime if you do have any questions. Sorry. OK. So just start by confirming some details with you. I've got Barry Roberts. Yeah. And your date of birth, the 12th of June 1991. Yeah, confirming as well. You are a male Australian resident.
[20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So please just note all calls are recorded. Any advice provided is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. Right, before we go too far through, can I ask, was there anything in particular that has prompted your interest there recently into looking at getting life insurance?
[51 seconds][Customer] : I don't know my dad. Even then she said that they did.
[54 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK. Yeah, no, Sir. I mean, look, at the end of the day, you know, these types of policies, it's not typically for your benefit. It is there for your family and your loved ones and, you know, looking after them when you're not here to do so, right? So that's how our cover works. It's a lump sum cash benefit paid to your loved ones when you pass away, right? Because it is paid as cash, it does mean no strings attached it. Once we're paid out, it's their money for them to decide how to use it. We do not get involved in that, right?
[56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : It's basically just that Peace of Mind in knowing that, like I say, if the worst happens, they are looked after, OK. Now we keep things as simple and easy as we can in terms of the application. So there's no medical check UPS required, no blood tests at all to get you approved for cover. We're just going to go through some health and lifestyle questions today as it will determine the final terms of the pricing of the policy as well if you are fully approved. Yeah, Yeah. Sorry.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, and if I want to add someone on me, but I want to get a close to see if I can add it on 1/2, like doesn't pay for the 1/2, OK.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So with our policy, it is structured to be a single cover only because like I say with those health and lifestyle questions, they have to come from the person being insured.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, no, that's fine.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : The answers, OK, yeah, alright. But yeah. So if you are fully approved for the cover without any changes, it is an immediate cover for death by any cause except for suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK. Also included is a terminally ill advanced payment, which means if you were to be diagnosed by a medical practitioner as having 24 months or less to live, going to pay out your life insurance in full to you. Alright.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yes.
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So hopefully of course you never use the policy for that reason, but that benefit is there for the worst case, OK? Also included with the cover, we have an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount up to a maximum $20,000 to help cover those more immediate expenses when you pass away like the cost of a funeral. OK, so it is exactly that. It's an advance payment made quite quickly within usually one business day of completed documents being received.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
