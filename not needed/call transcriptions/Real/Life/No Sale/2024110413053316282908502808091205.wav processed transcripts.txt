[18 seconds][Agent] : Hi, good morning there. It's guy here calling from Real Insurance. How you going today? That's good mate. I'm calling in relation to the life insurance inquiry that you've submitted online with us. I wanted to run you through your pricing and explain to you what the features and benefits do and I'm happy to answer any questions that you have as we go through this together.
[36 seconds][Customer] : What?
[36 seconds][Agent] : I will let you know today. All calls are recorded. Any advice I provide to you Sir is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation there. Can you please confirm for me your name? Yep and your date of birth is the 7th of the 3rd 75. Yep And you are a male Australian resident of course mate.
[53 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep.
[58 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Do you just go by do you prefer Chef or do you just go by Safania Chef? Yep no worries mate. Umm So what? We'll do, but let's go through and have a look at what these benefits do to start with Umm have you had cover before Chef or is this the first time getting life insurance? First time? OK. And what, what was your purpose at the moment of getting life insurance to pay? Sorry mate, you're cutting out a little bit now. I can't really hear you.
[1 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No, I just want to that was the on TV.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep. Right, right.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : I mean, yesterday someone was talking about the on the on the TV, someone in interview on the TV and and then I was I thinking, oh, why don't I just ask them how much I'm gonna pay if I want to insure my life or something like that. That's why definitely the problem.
[1 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, right, right. So, so I guess my question is a little bit left field from that. So you're looking to life insurance, we're going to get your price and whatnot, but what is the purpose of you having life insurance? Why do you need it?
[2 minutes][Customer] : MMM, MMM.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Do you have a mortgage or is this more for your family protection or debts or loans you might leave?
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : So many protection. So many protection.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, so you, you've got a couple of kids at home still. Yep, Yep. OK. So you just want you have 5.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, you mean no?
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Oh, what? What? And you how many kids you have? Two, 3, three. OK, no worries. All right. So your main reason is just you wanted to leave a bit of money to the family to maintain a loss so that you pass away. All right, cool. So the cover is designed to do exactly that, which is provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. Now, what you can do is you can allocate a percentage of this money to each family member of your choice. Now you can do up to five people at one time if you really want to, and then you can leave them their own amount so that when they get it, they get to decide how they spend their own amount, OK. So whether they use it for a mortgage, a loan, or to maintain their lifestyle the way they wish to, that's up to them. And if you just wanted to choose one beneficiary for now, that would be fine. They'll get the whole amount. But you can call back at any time and apply to change of beneficiaries license over the phone. Anyway, It's it's a very easy for you, OK, Now applying for it is very simple too. We don't need you to do any blood checks or medical tests, OK.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : But we are going to take you through a five to six minute yes or no help and last all questionnaire that will determine if you can be covered or not. If you do get accepted. And then once you decide to commence the policy from there, you will be covered immediately for that due to any course straight away, OK? Just keep in mind for me mate. So that's the only thing we don't cover is suicide in the 1st 13 month period. That's all OK. But we will cover that as well after the 1st 13 months, just so you know, OK.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Now in addition to that, we will immediately cover you for a terminally ill advanced payment. So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner with a terminal illness, we will pay you the claim in full while you're alive for whatever your benefit a man is at that time so that you can just utilize the money yourself. So whether it's the medical checks, umm or test to get the best care or umm you know, you might want to just set the family up, tick off a bucket list, it's really up to you. OK.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK, MMM.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Now the final benefit is a $10,000 advance payments.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Now this is going to be built into the cover mate. So it's all there in the one place.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK. MMM.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : When your beneficiaries called a claim, if you have passed away, please tell them that's there because they'll be able to ask for that.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK MMM. MMM.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now we do generally release the advance payment of $10,000 within 24 to 48 business hours to them. And that's provided that they've just supplied the correct documentation when they claim. So as an example, mate, we don't need a death certificate of that time unless they can get one. So please make sure they're aware. Umm, we will accept. So I'm proof by professional that you've passed away at that point, just so they're not running around trying to find a document they don't need. Do you know what I mean?
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Now WW with the rest of the claim, proud to let you know we we're a NSW Australian based call centre mate.

[7 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Got it.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Now, as I was mentioning, it's very important for if you pass away and this policy is in force, your beneficiaries make the call as soon as they can, OK?
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : MMM, no.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Uh, and they'll speak to our claims team. Now, as I mentioned, claims are dedicated to working closely with your loved ones and the insurer to ensure the, uh, process of accessing this life insurance benefit of man is made simple and easy for them.
[8 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[8 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, so on average, we do pay claims 10 days faster than the industry benchmark at 70 days versus 80 days, right? So you've got that pays in one with us too.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Alright.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK Umm, now there's no expiry on the cover, which means you are more than welcome to hold this for as long as you want, OK?
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So if you want to hold it for your whole life, that's fine as long as you're paying the premiums on time, OK? There is no locking contract or exit for any time, so it does not cost you a sense to cancel this OK? So realistically, once you have the cover, time frame is your choice as long as you're paying the premiums on time, OK, It is worldwide 24/7 coverage for what we've spoken about on this cover as well. OK, So if you travel, you have that peace and mind on your cover for what we've spoken about wherever you are in the world 24/7.
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now I just want to let you jump in there. So have you, do you have any questions at all for me so far? Is that all pretty clear?
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Alright, so I'll make it clear.
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[9 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Come again?
[9 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yep, just for an incentive. Like no judgement here made on the same to be honest, but just as an incentive if you ever decide to stop. So no cigarettes or vapes at all.
[9 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Uh, and you go 12 consecutive months in a row with none, nothing at all.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So no, no cigarettes or vapes.
[9 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[9 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Just make sure you call us back because you can just say umm, hey, just you, you can just have a quit of going 12 months in a row with no cigarettes or vapes at all. Can I apply to have my smoking status changed? And if that's approved to be changed for a non-smoker, your payments will adjust accordingly. OK, whether or not you do, that's up to you, but it's there. So if you do end up stopping for that long in a row, umm, just make sure you tell us about it. OK, Now the minimum cover is $100,000. I can then go up in 50,000 Seth, so 150,200 thousand 250,000, etcetera.
[10 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : It's five months.
[10 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : The the maximum is 750,000. Now whatever you choose here is just to start your policy on. I'm going to teach you how to change this over time as well. But how much cover do you currently need?
[10 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK, let's say let's start.
[10 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : 100,000? Yep. So we could give you $100,000 of cover for $24.35 per fortnight, which is every two weeks?
[10 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Let's start with 100 mm Hmm, $24.00.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yep, $24.35 per fortnight.
[10 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Any other ex, any other extra thing or only that?
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : How do you mean?
[11 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I mean you check $24.00, you're going to pay with that from my store with $24.00 something can with that.
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : You mean any other cost? Not on what would be explained. So everything I've explained to you so far, that's all. That's all included in that one price, $24.35 a fortnight. So that's what it is every two weeks. Is that suitable for you?
[11 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : So any other thing no any other cost, right, OK, OK, yes, suitable.
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Did you want to go any higher or is 100,000 OK for now?
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Let's let's go for 200,000.
[11 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So we could do the the 200,000 would be double that price mate. So.
[11 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Let me how much it will be 40.
[11 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, what you could do for me actually to make it easy, $24.35 a fortnight is what it costs you per 100,000. So we can use that as the key and we can work out your budget. So if you want 200,000, we just double that, 300,000 would triple that, etcetera. Right. What what was your budget per fortnight? What could you afford?
[11 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Hmm, yeah, I think they'll start with 100,000. Yeah, well, my wife is at work now. Uh, we will both want to do this. So if I do this, she can do it too?
[12 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So with 100, yeah, umm. But remember, like with the the life insurance is based on each person.
[12 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, each person. So I I I have to deduct $24.00, he has to deduct $24.00.
[12 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Uh, no. Well, her price will be based on her.
[12 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[12 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Your price is based on you, right?
[12 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I know.
[12 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So you can't really can pay yourself to somebody else because everybody's got different health and lifestyles, right?
[12 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, of course.
[12 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So that that's your indicative pricing based on your smoking status, your gender and your age.
[12 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : That's what you got that price based on. Now I need to take you through your questions to see if you can get approved. What we need to look for is if I can get you approved with no change, that's what your price will be, OK? So that's the best outcome. That's what I'm going to try and do for you.
[12 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK, alright. That's it.
[13 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Now if we go through, some people get exclusions and loading, so it can actually change the price or cover depending on what is your circumstances are like. But if anything like that happens, I'll stop and tell you as we go. Anyway, hopefully we can get you approved. At the end of the day, some people get declined so they can't have the cover at all. Just depends. OK, but with your partner, her pricing would be based on her age, her gender and her smoking status and her health and lifestyle, right?
[13 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, He doesn't. Bye. Bye.
[13 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. The so that it could be different in that case, you know what I mean? So with yours, are you happy to proceed to get approved for yours?
[13 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : I'll I might be approved or you're going to ask me some more questions.
[13 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Well, I'm going to try and get you approved. We're going to go through the questions.
[13 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : All right. Yep.
[13 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we're going to focus on that for now because I need to try and get you approved. And then from there, then I can tell you what we can do for you.
[13 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, All right.
[13 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, so let's pick an amount you want to go for first. All right?
[14 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : It's one $300,024.95.
[13 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So how much do you want to start with for you, the 100,000? Yep. Now I want to teach you a few things, Seth.
[14 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[14 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, so just wrote like I'm going to write these down anyways so I can reflect on them for you. So $24.35 a fortnight, every two weeks we'll give you $100,000 of cover. We pay you some money back on it called a real reward, and you can spend this money how you like, OK? What it means is following your first policy anniversary date, we will refund you 10% of the premiums you've paid in that time as a thank you. So you'll get back $63 and 31 cents to spend however you want off holding the policy for the 1st 12 months, OK? We're also going to provide you with a free online labor will be of the company safe will valued at $160.00 for your policy.
[14 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[14 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So each person that has a policy will get one of those each for free, OK?
[14 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : MMM, Nope.
[14 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So again, it's valued at $160.00. So you will get that and you can use that to organize your will, OK, Now every 12 months.
[14 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Alright, alright, great. Mm hmm. MMM. OK.
[15 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So if you're going to get a renewal, OK, when we're waiting these renewals, we want to have a look for the figure of what you'll cover is going to be and the figure of what your cost will be, how much it's going to cost you in the next 12 months, right. When you're rating these figures, it will consist of two things. The first thing being your premium is steps, which means it will generally increase eight years your age, OK? So the older we get set, the more risk we become, the more it's going to cost us. That will happen for everybody that holds one of the policies, OK. Now, aside from that, the second thing is the automatic indexation. And you can actually control that, OK?
[15 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, OK, alright.
[15 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : This is what I want to teach you. So automatic indexation means each year your sum insured, which is the money that you're covered for Seth, that will automatically increase by 5% so that you are covered for a little bit more each time. OK, Now, because this is your decision, when you read the renewals, it's going to automatically be there.
[16 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : MMM, MMM.
[16 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So if you like what it says and you leave it, it will happen, OK, But some use, you may not need it.
[16 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : MMM. MMM.
[16 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So some use you might read it and you might see your benefit going higher and you might think to yourself, I don't need that yet.
[16 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : MMM.
[16 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : I'm happy to stay at what I was last year for another 12 months.
[16 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : MMM. MMM. MMM. MMM. OK.
[16 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : That's when you make a 2 minute phone call for us and just say, guys, thanks for the renewal, but I don't need the increase in my cover.
[16 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : MMM. MMM.
[16 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : I'm going to opt out of it for this particular year. OK?
[16 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[16 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Now if you leave it on and you let your benefit go up by 5%, there's going to be an associated increase in premium.
[16 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK MMM, MMM.
[16 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So it'll cost a bit extra as well, right?
[16 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : MMM. MMM.
[16 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : But if you're taking it off, your benefits just going to stay the same as the year before, which is your cover. And then you won't get that associated increase in your premium that you you'll only get the general increase based on your age, OK.
[16 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : MMM MMM MMM.
[16 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Now, so if I'd like to look at this as a positive, this is a way that you can have small increases in your coverage over time without having to get approved again, OK?
[17 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[17 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So it's actually just you saying yes or no to it when you get the renewals, right? You can also do this every single year up until the policy anniversary after your 75th birthday stuff. So you've got a lot of like a long time to leave it on or take it off when you want it there or not, OK. Now aside from that, if you want to increase in a large amount in one go, that's also possible.
[17 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[17 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now the way to do that is calling back before you turn 65 and asking to get reapproved for your health questions again, OK, If you get approved again before 65, you can then look at your range and pick and choose what you want in one go and pay the difference. All right. Now on the other end of that, one more thing, you can apply to date crazy cover at any time. So if you get into the future and you've got, you know, say 300,000 and you think yourself only 100,000 again, then you can just call us and say, guys, can I decrease my cover down to this amount? And then just ask what your price is going to be. So if you lower your cover, if you apply to do that, your payments will lower accordingly. OK, does that all make sense so far? Yep. Now I'll give you a quick example of it for next year. This is important. So it says Stefania Katani, please be aware that all of our premium projections are indicative only and assume that you do not make any amendments to your cover. As an example, if you do not decline indexation on your policy, the premium payable in your following year of cover will increase to $28.09 a fortnight. So 2 eights .09.
[18 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Can you? That's just the last sentence. Again.
[18 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : But remember Seth, if you let that happen, that's yeah, yeah. So remember this is when you this is everything I just spoke to you about, right? So when, when you get the renewal. So let's say you get the renewal next year and and you're going to rate it and you're going to say the automatic indexation because remember that's always going to be that automatically. OK.
[18 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[19 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So it says here, Stefano Katani, please be aware that all of our premium projections are indicative only and they assume that you do not make any amendments to your cover.
[19 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[19 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So as an example, if you do not decline the indexation on your policy, the premium payable in your following year of cover will increase to $28.09. Yeah, but then your benefit amount goes up by 5%, it increases to $105,000 of cover at that point, right.
[19 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[19 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So if you read that and you you're happy with that, you can just leave it and it will happen. But but if you don't like it, 2 minute phone call to us. Thanks for the renewal guys. I'm opting out of this automatic indexation. What's my price going to be? That's how easy it is. Yeah, yeah. So as an example, if you decline indexation instead on your policy set, the premium payable in your following year of cover would instead go to $26.75 a fortnight and then the benefit amount will remain the same as the year before that at the 100,000 for another 12 months again. OK, so that's, that's the decision you want to make, right?
[19 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : MMM, OK, go. Yep.
[20 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Do I need this extra cover or do I not need it this year? What do I do? And it's up to you. All right. Umm, does that all make sense now?
[20 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Alright, yeah, makes sense.
[20 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Cool. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium 6, you'll be that figure. I just gave you a $26.75 a fortnight and you can also find information about our premium structure on our website too, mate. OK, now let's let's go through these questions. It's the last thing we need to do and I'll be able to tell you what the outcome is.
[20 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, Alright, alright.
[20 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, You said you're at Broken Hill.
[20 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : 2880 28802.
[20 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : What's your post code 82880?
[20 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[20 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Do I just put Broken Hill?
[20 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Broken. Yep. Yep.
[20 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[20 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : And there is 6/5 Sabina, St.
[20 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : And what's your straight address 365? Yep.
[21 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Sabina, ZEZEBINAZEBINA Sabina.
[21 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So 365 Sabina St. Yeah. Is that your postal address as well? Yeah. And I've got katanistefania@gmail.com.
[21 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, that's correct.
[21 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Best e-mail 0459644653 best contact for you.
[21 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[21 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : And again, Seth, uh, just to reconfirm, Mr. is your title and you are a male Australian resident. Is that all correct?
