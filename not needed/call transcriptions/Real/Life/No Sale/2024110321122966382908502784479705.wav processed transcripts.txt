Now, if you, let's say, but look at the year after, again, it goes to $83.86 per fortnight and then the benefit amount we arrived at $826,875. But let's say for example, you don't want that indexation with us. You've got the option where you can apply to opt out of the indexation. That means that the level of cover will stay the same if you decide to opt out of the indexation every year too. So you've got options, umm, there and what we go through too. You can also find information about our premium structure and that's available on our website.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
