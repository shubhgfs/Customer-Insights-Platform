[23 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Hi, can you just explain that one a little bit please?
[23 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Sure, yeah, I'll bring up the medical definition. Maybe that will give a better just medical definition, Tia. So TIAI think it's like a mini strike. So let's have a quick look. Tia, OK, so it's often referred to as mini stroke that Tia is caused when blood flow to the brain is impaired. Symptoms are usually shorter in duration than a full stroke and can often resolve. Other names for Tia includes vertebras, bacillia insufficiency or vertebra basilia syndromes, or sorry, AM AUROSIS fugates. So Tia themselves are respected for full blown strokes?
[24 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, so yeah, that was like you've mentioned things that like because I did have a brain bleed, which is was part of my stroke.
[24 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yes, but I haven't had any. Yeah, Wonderful.

[25 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that's very lucky because my uncle had it last year as well and he, he has some movement issue and speech and walking as well. Yeah. So, umm, up under his point, umm, I only acupuncture help them. He's able to speak a few words. Umm, but yeah, movement. His fingers tends to tense up. So yeah. No, you do, you do very well.

[26 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right. Stroke was something that I thought of, you know.
[26 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : And, you know, like, stroke was something that I thought of, you know, old people.
[26 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right.
[26 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : You know, it's not necessarily, you know, like I was 30 and I just. Yeah, just.
[26 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right.

[26 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Well, that's really good to hear that David. You're doing very well and can't tell at all. So that's really good. Umm, But going back to that question, David, umm, it's just like, do you think because it does was the Tia? So do you think would that be a yes or no for the answer or I'm not out of OK?
[27 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Well, I'm not 100% sure because as you said, some of the symptoms with the Tia like because I did have a brain bleed and that was the cause of my stroke. So but I've only had one.
[27 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yes, yeah, yeah, OK, sure.
[27 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : I haven't had like mini strokes or anything like that since you know, so I really don't as I said, I'm trying to be as open and.
[27 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : No, I really appreciate that. Umm, because if you, because that will probably have to be something I have to put on hold and you have to check with your doctor. OK, so if we were to answer yes to what it does ask, you know, was it due to a migraine or a contraceptive pill? But if we answer as a no to what, it will most likely come back as a decline.
[27 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Because he's never mentioned those, the Tia or anything to me when he's been in my you know, like I, I go to sleep once every six months now.
[28 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, I've heard the term before. Yeah.
[28 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : But, you know, you say I've NE I've heard the term before and, you know, like that. I'd always never used to describe mine.
[28 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : And you know, it was never used to describe mine. MMM. OK. They couldn't find the reason why. Yeah, I had a brain bleed and that's what it was.
[28 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : You know, they couldn't find the reason why, you know, I had a brain bleed and that's what caused it.
[28 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[28 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : So yeah.
[28 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, so for that question then David, because, umm, he only allows me put to put down yes, yes or no. There is that most likely. We do have to get you to double check with your doctor to see, you know what it might be umm, and then we can come back and revisit that question. OK.
[28 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah.
[28 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : But before the meantime, what I'll do there for you is I will go through the rest of those informations. Umm, and then if there's any other, umm, you know, condition that we need some confirmation from your doctor list we got.

[34 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : So you know, but so is that, would that be guaranteed to be accepted or what would I have to do?

Even though these saves the funeral product that's not limited to funeral I need OK umm, you can go send them an after 5 beneficiary as well Uh, if your death is due to an accident David, but then I said that would triple to $45,000.
[35 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[35 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah umm in addition, before the policy anniversary following your seventy 50th birthday, if you were to suffer an accidental serious injury such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit and that will also triple OK, So that will be also $45,000. OK. Umm as mentioned, it is easier to apply no medical checks as long as you are restraining a resident that between 40 and 79 acceptances guarantee. So you're pretty much approved the OK just so you know as well, David, for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury ID After the first 12 months, you will be covered for death due to any calls.
