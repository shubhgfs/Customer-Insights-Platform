So if you're insured for $400,000 on life and $200,000 on total term disability and if you were total permanently disabled and you access the optional cover, that means you have $200,000 left on life insurance left if you were to get paid out on optional cover.

[11 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, it it still works out the same amount? Yep.
[11 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : So that's and so fortnightly payment is about sorry.
