[4 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes and yeah.
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So look, I'll see how the cover works, OK. It's very straightforward. If you are accepted for the life insurance then once you decide to commence the policy you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK so let's say you take it out today and tomorrow you pass me in a car accident or a heart attack for example, Touchwood, you're gonna be covered for those kind of things straight away.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK now there's also a terminally ill advanced permit included as well, which means that at any time you hold the policy, if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner that in that case will pay out your life insurance benefit amount to while you alive. Now with the premium you might know this already but your premium is stepped which means it will generally increase each year the age. In addition, this policy is automatic indexation which means each year sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. However, you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year if you wish to. Each year you have that option. OK, I'm gonna give you an example.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : As an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year would be $30.51 a fortnight, but your benefit amount would have gone up to $525,000. OK.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Mm, Hmm.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So, but we'll let you know roughly 4 weeks prior to the policy anniversary date of what the new premium would be. And you can apply to decline that automatic indexation each if you wish.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, yeah.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well.
