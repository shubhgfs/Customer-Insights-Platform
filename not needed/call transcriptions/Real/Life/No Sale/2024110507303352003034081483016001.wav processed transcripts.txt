[1 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : That's if you decide to keep the cover. But umm, with the direct debit method we either know see on the BSP account number or a card number for the 21st. There is no surcharge either way. And which one's easier for yourself?
[1 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : What was that? Sorry?
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yes, it's for for the direct debit method for the 21st. Of course, we don't expect any upfront payments, but we do don't stay on the method for the 21st. So you can either note down the ESPN account number or a card number, but there is no surcharge either way.
