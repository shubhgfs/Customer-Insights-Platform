[2 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, So it just states here we will ask you questions that are relevant to our decision to provide insurance and on what terms. We will use your answers to decide what insurance we will offer, to calculate the premium and to assess claims. It's important that you answer honestly, accurately and with reasonable care. You're answering for yourself and anyone else to whom the questions apply, and your answers need to be correct after the date you'd want the policy to start. If you are unsure or need to check something, please do show before you answer. And lastly, if your answers are not accurate and complete, the policy may be cancelled or treated as if it never existed and claims may be denied or not paid in full. Do you understand and agree yes or no?

[3 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And if you were happy with the quote and decided you did want to go ahead with it, what date would you need your policy to start from this coming Wednesday? So that would be the 4th, is that correct?
[3 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Greenacre 2190 NSW from Wednesday or if if I could start it today but I can pay on Wednesday or do we have to start on Wednesday?
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Look, good question.
[3 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So let's say we set it as today's date or even like a few today, regardless of that, we would collect your payment details today, but you get charged on either the start date that you choose or within the five business day spelling. So if you're wanting to make sure the payment either comes out Wednesday or after, then it may, we may need to put it from Wednesday because I can't guarantee when the payment would come out, if you know what I mean.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, I'm gonna do Wednesday.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Wednesday. OK, thank you for your understanding. Now what type of home is this? Is it just a free standing house? Is it more like a villa, duplex townhouse?
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : It's a brick A2 story house, 5 bedroom home. There's en suite bathroom to the master room and two main bathrooms on 1st floor and ground floor.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Oh that's OK, thank you for giving us all that information. We don't even ask about how many beds or bathrooms you've got anyway, so that's fine. Just to confirm, it is a free standing house so it's not attached to any other dwellings, is that correct? Thank you. Is the home under a strata title or body corporate community title or company title?
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : And OK, yes, no.

[5 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, so we can accept to the OK, yes, so we can accept to the best of your knowledge, there's 30 years ago from today that would actually put it in the range of 1990 to 1994. Are you happy to slip that range?
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Yep.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : There's you just don't sound confident, I'm sorry. So we can accept to the best of your knowledge, but we want to make sure, of course, we're putting it in as accurate as possible. So would that be accurate that range there of 1990 to 94, right. I'll call you on this, this range for now, Juliet, but we you would need to find out the certain when it was built. OK, OK.

In the last 10 years And last one, have you, your partner legal or de facto, any other names insured or any other family member living at the home had any insurance cover refused or declined in the last 10 years? All right, last final check questions. Now these are just yes or no answers as well. Is your home currently sublet or going to be sublet?
[10 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No, No, no, no.
[11 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Is it well maintained in an A good conditions?
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it is. I've also done renovations.
[11 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Oh wonderful. Is it a heritage listed building? Is it on more than 10 acres of land? Is it used for any business purposes?
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[11 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : And last one, is it currently under construction and all renovation?
[11 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : At the moment, no.
[11 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. OK. And of course, if you do end up renovating any part of the home, of course, just contact us and let us know so you make sure you're still within our guidelines. I'm just loading your quote now. So with our home and contents insurance, you've got 2 levels of cover, our essential cover and our top cover. Both will cover you for all insured events such as flood, fire, theft and malicious damage, storm and rainwater.
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[11 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : However, the main differences are that the top cover provides you coverage for accidental damage contents in transit while moving to a new address in Australia, and it also has higher coverage limits to some benefits and options.
[12 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Top cover.
[12 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Of the two, would it be more the basic cover or the top cover that you'd prefer of OK. Now in terms of your excesses to start with, our excesses default to $1000 for your building excess and $750 for the content excess. Do you name it a change either of these or are they OK?
[12 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
[12 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : How would you like me to give you the price as an annual and monthly payment frequency?
[12 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Monthly frequency please.
[12 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Not a problem at all. So what we have here to insure your home for 900,000 and the contents for 100,000 under the top cover, your monthly premium is $339.70 per month and that is with the home excess of $1000. The contents excess of $750 with all government charges and GST.
[12 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[12 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : How does that one sound?
[13 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Good.
[13 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful. I'll just take you through the optional cover. So that way we've gone over everything. The first optional cover that we have is the Electrical Motorburner option. You can add on to the insurance for an additional premium.
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[13 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : You should be aware though, we do not cover electrical motors over 10 years old or ones under warranty. Is it something that you need to add or leave it off?
[13 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : What? What would electrical motor be?
[13 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So I'll give you some examples.
[13 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[13 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So when we look at anything a part of the home, it's usually anything that's permanently fixed. So like your automatic garage, roller door or duct, it'll fix air conditioning. They're typically things that are permanently fixed that will have a motor.
[13 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Oh, true.
[13 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Things that form part of your contents are usually those things that if you were to move homes, you take them with you. So like a fridge or a washing machine, for example. That makes sense.
[13 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah, yeah, yes, Yep.
[13 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Did you need to add this one on at all or did you want to leave it off? OK, so adding it for the home.
[13 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : I, I think it would be good to add it on because I have, because we do have inducted AC.
[14 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem. Just to confirm, it's no more than 10 years old and not under warranty. Beautiful. And is it under warranty?
[14 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : It's less than 10 years old and I think, I think we've already passed warranty. I think it's about 5 years old.
[14 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, too easy. So yes, so then that can apply to that if it's not under the warranty. So for the home, it's an extra $5.39 per month. Did you need to add it for the contents?
[14 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[14 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So that one's an extra $2.89 per month.
[14 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[14 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So I've added those two on. It just brings the total cost up to $347.98 per month.
[14 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[14 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : And if you want to claim on that motor burnout cover, it's got it's own fixed excess of $100.00. So it's not going to be the thousand or the 750 you pay. It's $100 instead.
[14 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK. Sounds good. Yep.
[14 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, now, now lastly, we have a section so you can list any valuables, collectibles, or media items that exceed our cover limits under the top cover for your contents. These limits are $1000 per item or collection or $5000 per group for each event. Would you like contents cover for items above our limits or for an extra cost? Are there any items you'd like covered outside the home under the portable valuables cover?
[15 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : I I And what will that cover be?
[15 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Are you talking about with the one that's just within the home, only under the valuables, collectibles and media items? Or are you asking about portable cover?
[15 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : What? What's the portable cover? Sorry.
[15 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So what portable valuables cover is? It's where you can cover a specific item or a group of unspecified items outside the home for accidental loss or damage. However, there is an extra premium so it costs more to add it on and it does provide you coverage Australia wide though outside the home Australia wide. So is there a certain thing, anything specif specifically, that you'd like to have covered away from the home or? OK.
[16 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : No, Anything outside of the home is fine, Yeah.
[16 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So just to reconfirm then, would you like contents covered for items above our limits or for outside of the home?
[16 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Would outside of the home be like the driveway or something like that? Yeah.
[16 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : It'd be, so let's say you go up to the shopping centre, so that's away from the home or if you go on holiday to like a caravan park or like you know, Interstate, that's kind of what we're referring to outside the home.
[16 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[16 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So if you're still on your property, so when you drive there in your backyard that's still at home, it's really when you're actually leaving your actual premises that we're referring to.
[16 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : And I mean, because I don't know what, what what would cause someone to make a claim for that.
[16 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : I mean, if they accidentally lose or damage an item outside the home, that's that's, that's can be where they can cover it, they can claim on it essentially.
[17 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK. No, no.
[17 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, So just to reconfirm, so would you like contents to cover for items above our limits or outside the home? You happy for me to say no for that one? OK, too easy. Yep, the price remains the same. So $347.98 per month. Now I just there's only one thing I just want to quickly Carr clarify. I know when I asked if the home's currently under construction and or renovation, you did say as of now, no because we're starting the policy on the 4th of September. Will you have anything under construction and a renovation at that point or in the anytime soon? OK, no problem.
[17 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, no, I, I, I do have plans to renovate my laundry, but that that's dependent on when I have funds to do it.
[17 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Right. So is that more like that's like something you're like planning in the future, but there's no actual contracts or anything signed as of yet?
[17 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : But that's my correct correct.
[17 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine. So we don't have to note it down now. It's just if you do go ahead with renovating your laundry, just get in contact with us and let us know so we can make sure you're still within our guidelines. The only. So we've done absolutely everything, Juliet. The only thing we just need to confirm now is when the home was originally built. We just need to make sure we've, of course, selected the right range. So when is a good time for me to ring you back? Once you've had a chance to find out that information, if you want to even have a quick look now, I can wait for you. That's not a problem. Yes.
[18 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : I'm just, I, I mean, I, the truth is I, I don't know where I could find that information, but I'm just looking up online when the property was first sold and it says March 1993.
[18 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK. So would that be indicated that's when it was built originally.
[18 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[18 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So I just want to make sure we selected the right range. So for when the home was originally built, we selected the range 1990 to 94. That's correct.
[18 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[18 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So what we'll do is we'll go ahead and get this one into place to start as of this Wednesday, the 4th of September. And although I'm collecting your payment details to get this locked in for you today, you're not going to get charged until the 4th of September or within 5 business days after that date. OK, perfect.
[18 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yes, yeah, yes.
[19 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Now I've already got you listed as a policy holder, but did you want to include any additional policy holders?

I am paid a salary and may receive bonuses. You'll agree to purchase Real Home and Contents Insurance subject to the terms and conditions that are in your Product Disclosure Statement. We will send you a copy of your PDS policy schedule and Financial Services Guide. You have a cooling off period of 14 days during which you can cancel the product and receive a full refund of premiums unless a claim has been made or a claimable event has occurred.
