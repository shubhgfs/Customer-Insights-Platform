[0 seconds][Agent] : Thanks for your patience here.
[1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, we'll be.
[1 seconds][Agent] : I'm sorry for the delay, but I've got Jaron on the line to this issue with that application.
[7 seconds][Customer] : But we'll be good.
[6 seconds][Agent] : Again, we've already confirmed all of these details.
[8 seconds][Customer] : We'll get plenty at 150,000, right?
[14 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you. Sorry. Hi there, Paya. Thank you, Michael.
[17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. How's it going?
[17 seconds][Agent] : So yes, as mentioned, yeah, I'm good, I'm good.
[23 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[20 seconds][Agent] : As mentioned, my name's Sharon from the sales team here at Real Insurance here to help out with the life cover just for my Peace of Mind as well. Paya let you know. I know my was confirmed full identification last time there as you were just mentioning and just from my end here to let you know that all calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general in nature, may not be suitable to your situation. So I think you've just mentioned you'd like to have a look at around 150,000 of life insurance. OK, beautiful. And if you don't mind me asking, Peter, just so I can figure out, you know best how we're going to help. What's got you thinking about life insurance recently? How beautiful.
[47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, for, for a lot because I've got five boys and yeah, like I sort of want to make sure that they're going to be OK if I pass away or something happens to me.
[1 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. No, look, very understandable there. Look, children are the most important thing I think is parents that we realise.
[1 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So you know, very, very beautiful thinking there pair. Well, look, hopefully we can help out today. We'll start having a look at 150,000 and then depending on price or whatnot, we can either look up or down from there.
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no worries.
[1 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Now, just while the figures do load, I'd also like to take you through how this works because it'll be a little bit different. Michael mentioned as well, you know, there's a few or you've got 2 policies with us at the moment, but you're looking at kind of changing 1 into the life insurance. Yeah. Perfect.
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : No, no, that look, that won't be a worry today. I should be able to take you through all of that very quickly as well. Payer. I'll just need to confirm. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no? So just confirming.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Pardon, Pardon.
[1 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Have you have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, of course.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. No, that's OK. Look, I'm guilty as charged as well.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it is.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Bit of a bad habit, I think we both know, but one that's hard to shake off. That's all right.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : It definitely is.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : I was. Look, I was going to say with five boys, don't blame you as well. Beautiful. Oh, beautiful. That's so exciting. Very, very good stuff. Umm, yeah. Just to give you a heads up there, you are eligible to select anywhere from 100,000 up to 750,000, but we'll start off at 1:50 because I always like to focus on affordability first as well.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : I've got 4 grandchildren as well, so yeah, yeah, Yep, yes, Yep. I'd love to be able to give my children 750,000 but I don't think that's going to be possible.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful now we we never know, of course, but no, it would be nice. Umm now having a look here. So the main way the life insurance is designed, of course, it used to provide that financial protection in this case for your boys, if anything was to happen to you.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep. Yep.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Now it kind of works out almost perfect because we allow you to nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the amount, meaning you've got a position for each of them there. Perfect. Now, it is very easy to apply for.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[3 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : All we'll need to do today is go through a set of health and lifestyle questions over the phone, see if you're approved. And if you are accepted, once you decide to start the policy, you'll be protected immediately for deaths you to any cause. The only thing that's not covered is just suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, no worries.
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. But no. Yeah, won't be a worry. Of course.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : The suicide after 13 months is covered.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Now the other thing that's included, fingers, correct?
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : No, of course.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Hoping it's not the case of course there, but I wish just to outlay the policy how it works. There is a waiting period essentially on it.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Now the other thing included is the terminally ill advanced payment. This just means, knock on wood, if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, we can actually pay the life insurance out in full whilst you're still alive. Alright, perfect. And then the last thing just to mention that is included within this payer, there is a $10,000 advance payment.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : And that's just to assist during the initial claims process there with any urgent expenses that might pop up around that time. Beautiful.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, so I can take $10,000.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : No, so it wouldn't be for yourself, it's for your beneficiaries when they're claiming they can request an advance payment.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah, OK. Yeah, I get. Yeah, they can pull 10,000 if I need it.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Perfect. OK.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Well, that's the policy explained in full there. I'll just double check. Did you have any other questions on how the policy works? No. OK, wonderful. We'll have a look and see what the cost will be. If we're looking at 150,000 per at the moment, it's working in at a fortnightly premium of $32.38.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah, no, that's fine.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So what's that going about $16.00 a week? That's good for you there. OK, no beautiful. Always like making sure.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. No worries.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Now I'll start loading up the application in the background, but I'll let you know a little bit about how the premiums work as well, just so you've got an idea of it moving forward.
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Now they are stepped just meaning that they will generally increase each year as you age. And in addition to that, the policy also includes automatic indexation. And this is actually a way that you can slowly increase the life insurance over time if you feel the need. So it means that the sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. However, you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year. And just to give you an example, this would be as an indication if you made no changes to the policy, unless the 5% increase on the life insurance will go up to $157,500 and then cost you a total of $40.35 per fortnight.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Now if you do ever become curious, you'll also be able to find more information about our premium structure on our website. Umm, now it works out perfect because I know umm, a colleague would have confirmed all your details already.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes][Agent] : They're all up to date, which means if we do get you approved, of course we can have all the information sent out to you there.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Did they change my last name?
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Sorry.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : I'm sick. I'm sick now.
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Oh, got you. So has your like recently.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Pardon.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Are you like married or separated?
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : I'm married.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Got you OK, so was that means like your surname is no longer McLaughlin?
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : No.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, no, that's all right. Well, unfortunately I can't update that myself there pay.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : I would have to get the support team, uh, to do an internal change, but that's all right because we'll get that sorted for you today anyway.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : No worries.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : But very, very exciting stuff there of course.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so it was Smith you said your surname is OK, Perfect. I'll make sure I get that updated for you there now, umm, I'll take you through the application.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : We'll see what we can do for you today.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : No worries.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Umm just before we do go through I do need to read out the pre underblinding disclosure and it just makes you aware of your responsibility before answering the questions. So it just says here. Please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes. We collect your personal information to provide insurance quotes, issue cover and other related services. We will share this with your insurer and may share it with other Australian service providers for the purpose of administering your policy or handling claims. Our privacy policy tells you more, including how to access and collect your information and lodge complaints about breaches of privacy. By proceeding, you understand that you are applying to purchase a life insurance policy and as such, you have a duty to take reasonable care to not make any misrepresentations. This means you need to ensure that you understand each question I ask you and that you provide honest, accurate and complete answers.
[7 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : None.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : You need to answer each question in full, even if you have provided some information to us in any earlier discussions you have had. If you do not take reasonable care, you may breach your duty, and if this happens, your insurer may be entitled to cancel your policy, decline a claim, or make adjustments to the terms and conditions of your policy. So I'll now just confirm, do you understand and agree to your duty, yes or no?
[8 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, I did.
[8 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. Now these questions, very, very straightforward. I'll just need to make sure I read them out in full first and then I'll ask you yes or no. You respond accordingly. We should be able to move through pretty quickly.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep, no worries.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So starting off the first one, just confirming, have you been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the last six months or have you been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last seven days? Yes or no?
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : No, No.
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : No, very good. The next question is confirming, are you a citizen or permanent resident of Australia or New Zealand? Currently residing in Australia. Yes or no?
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yes. And does your work require you to go underground, work at heights above 20 meters, dive to depths below 40 meters, use explosives or travel to areas experiencing war or civil unrest, or work offshore? Yes or no?
[9 minutes][Customer] : No.
[9 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : No, thank goodness. Of course, the next section here, this is just in relation to your height and weight, so please be aware that I am required to obtain a confident single figure measurement for each one in order to move through with the rest of the application starting off first pair either using centimeters or feet and inches. What is your exact height? Or if you remember the last time you checked, what would it be?
[9 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : I would be maybe. How far would that be? 5 Three feet? I think I'm 54.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK. So we would, as I mentioned, we do need a confident response. I can only accept the confident response, not really a guess. Would you be more confident that it's between a slight range, So like as in five foot 4 to 5 foot six or five foot two to five foot four? What would you OK, as in like between 5 foot 4-5 feet and six inches? Sorry, 5 feet and four inches and five feet and six inches that range there. OK. If you're confident with that response, I can accept obviously the slight difference. But in that case, we just place in the shorter height.
[9 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, 53544, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not very tall.
[10 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So we'll place in five feet and four inches and no, that's OK, not a worry at all. And then in terms of weight, we can accept kilograms, pounds or stones.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : I'm 160K.
[10 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So if you know your exact weight, OK, we'll pop that in there. OK, Kilos and I'll let you know pay the application has come up as unsuccessful. So we wouldn't be able to offer the life insurance at this time just due to the height and weight ratio.
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK, what about my husband?
[10 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Now it's not ex sorry.
[10 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : What about my husband?
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : I mean he can apply for the life insurance as well. It's just not something I can kind of take through the questions or any of it. Like through you, he would have to apply for himself just to kind of cover what we've.
[11 minutes][Customer] : OK, that's it.
[11 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So anyway, just to circle back to that. So based on, as I mentioned, the application's unsuccessful, you can ask the insurer to review this decision. If you're not happy with the outcome, you can request that we treat it as a complaint. But I wanted to mention to you, payer, that it's not ruling you out for life insurance forever or as a whole. OK. So obviously, as those things do change, we can accept different ratios in the future. However, we may have a different option for you coming up in the next couple of weeks. We've got some things coming out. So if you want to give us a call all in a couple of weeks, you can definitely apply again as we'll have some different sort of products, if that makes sense.
[11 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I can't. Yeah. Yeah. Well, can I pay it to the life insurance that I have? Yep.
[11 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : The other policy, Yeah OK, we'll take you through because I was going to say I can see as well that you do have a, you've already got another funeral insurance with us. Look, the other thing that I can offer you at this time payer, uh, is some information on the funeral insurance that we're looking at at the moment. Umm, or sorry that we're running at the moment, if that'd be of interest for you.
[12 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep.
[12 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK. We'll have a look at that. It's just to see what that works out to be. Now it's anywhere from 3000 up to $15,000. And I believe as it is a slightly different policy, we can actually have a look at the 15,000 as a maximum there. I'll clarify that anyway, but let's have a look here. I'll just see how much you've got in place at the moment.
[12 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : 115 thousand, I think.
[12 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Got you. OK, so you've already got the 15,000. If you don't mind here. Can I pop you on a very brief hold? I just wanna double check and see if we can based off of the products or product that you've got in place at the moment, if we can have a look at any more, uh, you know, coverage for our funeral insurance.
[12 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[12 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So just wait there a moment.
[12 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no worries.
[12 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : I'll be back in a SEC Thank you. Thank you very much for your patience there, Pia. So we can actually have a look at an additional 15,000 of the funeral insurance given that it is a different policy or different product, if that makes sense? Perfect. So if yeah, I'll have a look at just the price here for you for the 15,000 of extra funeral cover works out at $31.36 per fortnight.
[14 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, So what was that on top of the 60?
[14 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So I don't know what you would be paying at the moment just because I'm only in the sales team. I can't see uh, anything.
[14 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : I I pay 60. I pay 60 for me and my husband. Yeah. My husband wants to do a life insurance like a, you know, cover for everything, but I'm but I'm going to pay for it.
[14 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I can definitely have a look into the life insurance and I got you. No, that's OK. Just to double check, just because I'm in your profile at the moment. What I can do is I can get you back through to umm, I may have to get you through to the cancellations team.
[14 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Like yeah, yeah, yeah. But can Michael, can you talk to Michael about life insurance 1st and details?
[14 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : I believe, umm, just to go through for the I can, but it's just because I'm in your profile at the moment. It would be easier to get you through.
[15 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Well, can you get into his profile?
[15 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, most certainly I can do that for you payer. So just to clarify, with the funeral insurance for yourself be of interest or not? Really.
[15 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Pardon.
[15 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Well, so.
[15 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I'm not.
[15 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[15 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[15 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So you don't want to look at additional funeral cover, OK. No, that's all right. Not a worry at all. What I'll have to do is bear with me just a moment. I have to place you on a brief hold again just so I can access and get out of your profile here. OK. All right.
[15 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no worries.
[15 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you very much. All right, thank you very much for your patience here again. So if you want to pass your partner on, I'll just have to confirm everything with him there. So I'll just have a chat to him now.

[20 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yes, that's all right. And having a look here. So the minimum will be $100,000. Maximum we could have a look at for yourself would be, I believe 5, no 750,000 as well.

[22 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[22 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : And if you're accepted, once you decide to start the policy, you'll be protected immediately for death due to any calls. The only thing that's not covered is just died in the 1st 13 months.
[22 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[22 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. The other thing that's included there is a terminally ill advanced payment. This just means that if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, we can actually pay the full life insurance amount out whilst you're alive.
[23 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep. Oh, OK.
[23 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Fingers crossed.
[23 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's the thing too.
[23 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : It doesn't need to be the case of course, but yeah but it's there just in case. Beautiful.
[23 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Now the last thing, just to go over with you there, Michael, would be included in the life insurance. There's a $10,000 advance payment and that goes out much quicker in the event of a claim to help out with any funeral costs or any other urgent bills at that time.
[23 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[23 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Now that's the life insurance explained in full everything there, Michael, that's all making sense.
[23 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep. It is. Yes.
[23 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, wonderful. And any questions for me at all so far?
[23 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : The only question is sometimes what do you have to be a person that's working to be covered too because we're pensioners, that's the thing.
[23 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : No, no. So look, as long as you're able to make payments, it is affordable.
[24 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[24 minutes][Agent] : That's perfectly fine. Our life insurance doesn't require you to be working. Perfect.
[24 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, cool kind of question I already had.
[24 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : No, no, that's all right. Not a worry. All right, well, I'll take you through the application, Michael. We'll see if we can get you approved for this insurance as well.
[24 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[24 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So confirm everything there. Beautiful. OK, let's jump in here. So I'll need to read out to you the pre underwriting disclosure.
[24 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[24 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So it's just a statement. It'll make you aware of your responsibility before you answer the questions.
[24 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[24 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : And then from there we can jump straight into it.

[24 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : By proceeding, you understand that you are applying to purchase a life insurance policy and as such, you have a duty to take reasonable care to not make any misrepresentations. This means you need to ensure that you understand each question I ask you and that you provide honest, accurate and complete answers.

[25 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah.

[26 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : No, that's all right. And then the next section here is in relation to height and weight. So in order to move forward with the application, need to make sure that we have a confident single figure measurement for each one. Starting off first, Michael, either centimeters or feet in inches, what is your exact height or if you remember the last time you checked, what would it be?

[27 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit taller than pier.
[27 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK.
[27 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[27 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So would you be confident that you're 5 feet and like between 55 and 5-6? OK, In that case, we can accept the shorter height just following our process. So you're happy for me to place in five feet and five inches?
[27 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, sorry.

[28 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : No.
[28 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : No, and then finally up to the medical history section here.
[28 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[28 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So Michael, the way this form will work, there is a main question at hand that I'll read out and refer back to and then just a list of different health conditions.
[28 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[28 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So again, just a yes or a no will be perfect.
[28 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[28 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So the question just asks, have you ever had symptoms of being diagnosed with or treated for or intends to seek medical advice for any of the following, starting off with cancer, tumor, mole or cysts, including skin cancer, sunspots, Melanoma or leukaemia? Yes or no? Very good. And have you ever had an abnormal PSA test or an enlarged prostate? Yes or no.

[29 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : No, that's good. Anxiety, depression, or stress requiring medical treatment or any other mental health disorder? Yes or no?
[30 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : That little bit confusing. I do suffer from anxiety and depression. I'm on medication for that.
[30 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK. Then in that case, yeah, we can answer yes to that, Michael.
[30 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : So yes for that.
[30 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : That way we can capture that condition under that section there. And by answering yes, it'll bring down further drop down questions.
[30 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep. Uh huh. Yep.
[30 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So the next one's just confirming, is your condition a form of schizophrenia, bipolar, or psychotic disorder, yes or no?
[30 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : No.
[30 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : And is your condition one of the following? So I understand you've already mentioned to me that it is depression and anxiety, but I'll need to read all of the options here as well.
[30 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : And then you just let me know which best fits.
[30 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah, no worries.
[30 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK perfect. So the next to ask is your condition option A depression, anxiety, post Natal depression or stress including post traumatic stress disorder, Option B, anorexia nervosa or bulimia, Option C, ADHD or ADD. And then option B is just other mental illness.
[31 minutes][Customer] : But I was just depression and I thought it wasn't it.
[30 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So ABC or D, correct.
[31 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, it'd be that one. Yep.
[31 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK perfect.
[31 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Put on something else.
[31 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Option A No, that's all good. And then the next questions asking how many episodes have you had which have required treatment?
[31 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : In the last three years, none really, because I'm pretty good on my medication. I've given me. I've been on for quite a few years.
[31 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Well, what I might do, because, umm, we have our definition for what we classify as an episode. It may not be what you're thinking initially, umm, not necessarily like a sort of big event or you know, something of the sort. It's just to help us narrow down the severity of your symptoms. So I'll read out.
[31 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep.
[31 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I've got a definition here and I've got 3 examples that I'll have to read out.
[31 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh.
[31 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : It'll help narrow down exactly how many you've had.
[31 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep. OK.
[31 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK perfect. So the definition says an episode is an event, occurrence or recurrence of symptoms with increased severity from normal mood and usually require either medical intervention, referral, treatment or alteration slash adjustment to existing maintenance treatment. Now treatment can take the form of medication and or counselling slash therapy. OK now these 3 examples. So firstly if someone has mental health symptoms that require treatment this is an episode and if they return to their doctor several times to monitor the situation and or for repeat prescriptions this is the same single episode OK.
[31 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, OK.
[32 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : If, however, they have a relapse or symptoms worsen and treatment needs to be changed or increased, then this constitutes a second episode. And similarly, if the applicant recovers and treatment stops and the applicant is fine, but at a later date, symptoms return and they have to go back to the doctor to seek further advice, this would be a separate episode. So Michael, based off the examples that I've given there, how many episodes would you say you've had which have required treatment?
[32 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, it's confusing. I'm sorry. I'm a bit confused about it because I'm on TH, the medication, I've been on it like they haven't actually taken me off it. So I'm just on it constantly.
[33 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Right, If I may ask, because I may be able to help kind of navigate exactly how many it's been.
[33 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So if you can give me a bit of a rundown, when you first started experiencing these symptoms, you know, the depression, anxiety, I imagine you went and sought help from the GP, correct? OK, now from there we like the first time you started encountering these symptoms, correct.
[33 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yeah, yeah, yes, yeah, yeah, Yeah.
[33 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Saw the GP, have they placed you on medication and has it just been repeat prescriptions since then or have there been any changes or updates over time just repeat and that's been working and managing those symptoms for you.
[33 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : I just repeat prescriptions and then yeah, ye yes. Oh yeah, definitely, yes.
[33 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, No very good. Well look based from what you're telling me there Michael, it would just be one singular episode.
[34 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[34 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful.
[34 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, sorry, I was a bit confused about that one.
[34 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So the option no, no, that's all right. Look, it is a bit tricky because it's not, you know, our definition and examples isn't something we really talk about or do in day-to-day life. It's just to help us, you know, gauge, you know, people's history of, you know, these conditions.
[34 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So what I'll do, I'll place in one to two episodes, but then just to rule out that it was a just a single episode, the next question asked, was it more than one episode? Yes or no?
[34 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : No.
[34 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : No. Perfect. OK, Now the next questions asking, have you had symptoms or treatment for this condition within the last six months? Yes or no?
[34 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[34 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And have you ever seriously contemplated or attempted suicide? Yes or no?
[34 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : No.
[34 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : No, that's good to hear. Beautiful. And that captures everything there, meaning we can move on to the next main questions at hand.
[34 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[34 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Now, the next one here, Michael, this is asking any illegal drug use, abuse of prescription medication or received medical advice or counselling for alcohol consumption. Yes or no? No very good disorder of the kidney or bladder. Yes or no. No blood disorder or disease? Yes or no. No and asthma or other respiratory disorder, excluding childhood asthma. Yes or no? No, Perfect. OK. That's the biggest section out of the way doing well so far.
[35 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[35 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Now the next question here, Michael, this is asking other than what you've already told me about. So this is anything new that we haven't spoken about yet.
[35 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[35 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : In the past three years, have you sought medical advice or treatment by a medical practitioner or specialist? Yes or no? Yes. OK.
[35 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yes, Yep.
[35 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : And just to confirm the other part of the question, are you awaiting results for any medical tests or investigations such as but not limited to any surgeries, X-rays, scans, blood tests or biopsy? Yes or no? No, So not waiting anything that's good.
[36 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, Yep.
[36 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : But obviously, because you have sought medical advice in the past three years, what conditions would that be in relation to?
[36 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Just to do with my an going and professional time. I'm going to get some prescriptions for that, all that sort of stuff. Yeah, that's. Oh, OK.
[36 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : So this question is asking aside from what we've already covered, so the depression, anxiety, we don't have to mention in this question here, but was there anything else in the past three years that you've sought medical advice or treatment for?
[36 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yes, There was when I have, when I had trouble with my reflux, had trouble with reflux, sort of advice for that. And they've done that thing where they put the camera down. Yeah. And have a look.
[36 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Got you. OK.
[36 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[37 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So would you since that point in time there, Michael, would you say the reflux is well controlled?
[37 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm now on medication. Yes. Yes.
[37 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK, So it's well controlled and confirming that there's no Barrett's esophagitis. You don't suffer from that?
[37 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[37 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, well one of the options I have got here is reflux, well controlled with no Barratts or suffer guidance, so I can place that in.
[37 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[37 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Was there anything else in the past three years?
[37 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, No, that was that was it.
[37 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. That is captured there for you.
[37 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[37 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Alrighty, no, Yes on the list. All right, now the next question Michael's asking, other than what you've already told me about, are you contemplating seeking medical advice for any symptoms you are currently experiencing within the next two weeks? Yes or no?
[37 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[37 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : No, that's good. And that's all of your health questions out of the way.
[37 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[37 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : We've only got 2-3 questions left and the next two are just about your family history, so this is only to the best of your knowledge.
[38 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[38 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Have any of your immediate family, meaning mother, father, brother or sister, living or deceased, ever been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, Huntington's disease, or familial adenomatous polyposis? Yes or no? No, and to the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family suffered from cancer, heart condition, stroke or other hereditary disease prior to the age of 60? Yes or no?
[38 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm sorry.
[38 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So before the age of 60?
[38 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : What was mum when she lost away? Certainly. No, I didn't have my mum. She passed away from cancer, but she was 70 when that happened.
[38 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Oh goodness.
[38 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[38 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : I'm very sorry to hear, Michael.
[38 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Well, that's OK.
[38 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : I appreciate letting me know. But yes, because obviously older than the age of 60, we won't have to disclose that there. Just to confirm, was there any other immediate family that suffered from those conditions before 60?
[38 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yep, no.
[38 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : No. OK, placing a no. And then the last question today, Michael, this is just confirming. Other than one off events like a gift certificate or a voucher, do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fair paying passenger on a recognized airline? Motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, AB sailing, scuba diving deeper than 40 meters, cave or wreck diving or any other hazardous activity. Yes or no? No, that's OK. A bit too dangerous in my opinion. Umm, beautiful. Well, that's the application done and dusted there. Very much appreciate uh, the time of day. Let's see what the outcome is and beautiful Michael, I'll say very big congratulations to you there mate.
[39 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No, OK. Yeah, yeah.
[39 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : You have been approved for the life insurance so you can get covered. But there is one change that has been made and that's just due to your disclosure under the mental health symptoms questions that we went through.
[39 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep.
[39 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So there has been a premium adjustment and that's just due to essentially mental health one to two episodes and symptoms of treatment within the last six months.
[40 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
[40 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So as it's an ongoing treatment, it is just going to adjust there a little.
[40 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep, Yep, Yep. OK. It's gone.
[40 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Now if we're having a look at the updated prices for you, so for the $150,000 of life insurance that's now working in at $66.45, is that still affordable for you there or do we need to adjust?
[40 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : I'll just ask my wife. It's because it's gone up a bit because of shift changes. For 66 dollars.
[40 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : That's alright.
[40 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yes, Yep, Yep. You can do that. Yep, uh huh. Yep, yes, yeah.
[40 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, Just like to make sure now I'll only have to go over a couple more things with you, Michael, and then I'll get paid back on the phone in a second just so I can take her through the sort of payments and that sort of thing there because as she said, she wanted to pay for it herself.
[40 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[40 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Now, the one thing to be aware of is just how the premiums work as well. So they are stepped just meaning that they will generally increase each year as you age. And in addition, this policy also includes automatic indexation. And this means each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. However, you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year. OK.
[40 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[41 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : All right.
[41 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : No worries. Yep.
[41 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Now, just as an indication, this is if you make no changes to the policy and leave, the 5% increase on the benefit amount will go up to $157,500 and cost you a total of $82.48 per fortnight in the following year.
[41 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[41 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, All right. Now, if you do become curious, you'll also be able to find more information about our premium structure on our website. Umm, but that is everything to cover for you there, I believe.
[41 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Oh, cool.
[41 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Let me just double check.
[41 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[41 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : All right, perfect.
[41 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Oh, awesome. Yeah.
[41 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So what will happen from here in a second? Michael, I'll obviously take down and confirm things with payer. But the last step for you today, I'll need to read out the final declaration so that way you can agree and confirm that you're happy with it all and we can pop it in place and get you covered.
[42 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, yeah. Yep. No worries.
[42 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, All right, beautiful. So just before I speak to payer, I'll just confirm. Michael, do you give me the authority to speak to payer in relation to the application outcome and the life insurance today? OK, perfect.
[42 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep.
[42 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : All right, if you want to pop payer on and then I'll speak to her and I'll sort out the payment dates and the payment arrangements, and then I'll just need you back on the phone afterwards to read out the declaration. OK.
[42 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK, no worries.
[42 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : All right. Thanks, man.
[42 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[42 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Hi there, Paya, How are you?
[42 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. How are you?
[42 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So I've gone through everything. Michael probably would have made you aware as well.
[42 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[42 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : He's been approved for the life insurance. Yeah, perfect.
[42 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[42 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So what we'll need because you've mentioned that you wanted to pay for this yourself.
[42 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[42 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So I'll take you through and just confirm those things and then I'll just need to speak to Michael to go through the declaration with him. So if we're having a look here, it was the 150,000 of life insurance working in at $66.45 per fortnight. You're happy with that?
[42 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Well, we'll move through to the next screen here and now. This would be completely up to you. Firstly, we'll just pick the first payment date for this policy. When would you like that to be here? Mm, Hmm.
[43 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Let me have a look at my calendar. Just hang on a SEC.
[43 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : That's OK.
[43 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : It'll make it on the 31st.
[43 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : On the 31st, let me double check and see is it 7/14/21?
[43 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that'd be great.
[44 minutes][Agent] : Yes, I can do it for the 31st that fits just within the range there no perfect.
[44 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[44 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : And then that will be just every fortnight on the Tuesday from the 31st moving forward.

Hanover relies upon the accuracy of the information you have provided when assessing your application. That includes the information we initially collected from you to provide a quote. Hanover has set a target market determination for this product, which describes the type of consumers this product is designed for. Our distribution practices are consistent with this determination and you can obtain a copy on our website.

Benefit amount of Michael Smith receives $150,000 in the event of life insurance. A benefit is not paid in the event of suicide in the 1st 13 months of the policy.
[49 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[49 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : For Michael Smith Life Insurance, a loading was applied during the application process.

You may request for any of these alternative terms to be reviewed at any time by calling us. Your premium for your first year of cover is $66.45 per fortnight. Your premium is stepped which means it will be calculated at each policy anniversary and will generally increase as you age. Your sum insured will also increase automatically by 5% each year and you can opt out of this each year. Included in your premium is an amount payable to GFS up to 65% to cover costs. Your premium will be debited from your nominated bank account in the name of Tia Barona which you are authorised to debit from and have provided to us. The policy documentation, PDS and FSG will be mailed to you and if you have provided us with an e-mail address, your policy documentation will also be emailed to you today. You should carefully consider these documents to ensure the product meets your needs. You have a 30 day calling off. When you make it to your policy and any premium you may have paid will be refunded in full unless you have lodged a claim. There are risks associated with replacing policies as your new policy may not be identical to your existing cover. We recommend that you do not cancel any existing policy until you have received and reviewed our policy in full. And lastly there, Michael, it just states that we have a complaints process which you can access at any time by contacting us. Full details are available online and in the documentation that we are sending in. So I appreciate your patience there.
