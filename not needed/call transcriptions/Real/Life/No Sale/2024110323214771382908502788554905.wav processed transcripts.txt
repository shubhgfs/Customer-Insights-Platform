So Stephen, what we need to do is we do need to refer this application off to the underwriters for further assessment. So it's in relation to the epilepsy and the fact that you have had a a seizure in the last two years. Now while your application is being assessed, you will actually be covered for accidents or deaths, which pays out if death was due to a direct result of an accident, cover under this loss until the insurer makes a decision on your application or 30 days from today, whichever is earlier. Now to refer this one off for you. We basically get the policy set up in full. That way if it comes back approved and you're happy with the outcome, it's not an easy for us to just hit accept for you. So I'll confirm a couple more of your details so that we could do that. I've got your e-mail address as stevencarriage69@gmail.com, is that right?
[16 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[16 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. And this number I've called you back on, is that your preferred contact number? All right, too easy. And is this your best address? I'll just reconfirm is 14 Tom Brown Rd. in Port Kembla.
[16 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep.
[16 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : All right, too easy. Now, even if this does come back approved today and we covered you, you still don't have to pay anything until the day that you choose. So what day would you like me to note down for the first payment day?
[16 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : So how long did you say that Approved?
[16 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : I'm sorry, what was that?
[16 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : So how long?

Like I should have an answer for you within the next couple of hours. OK. They're usually pretty quick at getting back to us same day. I can't do fortnightly payments on a weekend, but I can do the following Monday for whatever Saturday works.

[18 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So either way, it's entirely up to you what you want to do. So at the moment obviously we can't cover you or insure you for the full policy unless it gets approved by our underwriters.
