[1 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK. And the life insurance you held at the moment, was that held in New Zealand or here in Australia or?
[1 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Ye here in Australia.
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Well, of course, certainly happy to help provide you with some free comparison today. We do just like to say that if you're replacing an existing policy with this cover, we recommend you do not cancel until your application has been approved and you've reviewed this policy in force. It may not be identical to your existing cover. And of course, you'll also consider the benefits may not apply waiting periods. It may start again.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yep, sure.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : It's in terms of having some cover in place. What originally prompted you to take that one out?
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Well, when I came here, I took life cover for me and my wife as a standard thing. I said, well, it's good to have life insurance cover. That's the reason. And since then I haven't checked it. Actually, it's been what, 12 years? I had the same color. I'm just trying to see whether I'm I will paint or not, that's all.
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : No, no, nothing.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : And in terms of this covered, was there anything you're concerned about having covered with this like a mortgage or a loan or some more to leave the family or?
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, just just like a normal person. I want to make sure if into just something does happen then there's a life color for me, that's all.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK. And well, in terms of this one, if there wasn't any sort of mortgages, loans, whatnot that's yeah, you're concerned about having covered at the moment, would you be looking at a similar level of cover as well? Or would you be looking at reducing your level of cover to try and save some money that way too?
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, night it's living at similar level of Carbon Depot.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, Well we'll have a look at that for you now in terms of bit of an intro to our cover, how it's going to work for you. So this is going to be there to provide some financial protection for your loved ones, which is going to be done through a lump sum payment. If you did unfortunately pass away, they can use that however they see if it's of course to help with living costs just maintaining their last or why not. But of course we let you pick anywhere from 1:00 to 5:00 beneficiaries on our product. So did you have anyone in mind that you'd like to leave something like this behind for?
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's, I want the two policies for me and my wife and it's already my policy beneficiaries, my wife and my wife's policy beneficiary myself.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : All right, perfect. We can certainly help arrange something like that for you. And in terms of US, of course, we do have a dedicated claims team. We work in the same office I work in here in Western Sydney. So if something did unfortunately happen to yourself or your wife, then yes, of course we'd be dealing with a dedicated claims team that is Australia based. But have a look at quotes. We'll start with quotes for your policy for yourself.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : I just need to ask, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months in terms of your benefit a minute, we can look today from $100,000 up to 500,000. So what level of cover would you like me to quote on?
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : I think I had it at half a million, then it went up to 650 and I've got it down again and then it's now again. I think it's about 6:50 as well.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Uh, I think I had it half a million, then it went up 160 and I brought it down again. OK, so you're wanting to look at about the half a million then.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : So the area they adjusted according to the information, uh, you know, look at about 6:50, I think we'll give the apple to Apple comparison. So.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, Well, in terms of that, as I said, we can look from 100,000 up to 500,000 is our maximum. So we'll have a look at that 500,000 for you. And that's I did 10 in terms of what you'll actually be covered for with us. So if you're accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months. So that's the only waiting period you have to serve. Then in addition to that, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included, which hopefully you never have to claim on. But that just means if you're diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner. Yeah, a very unfortunate case. So we're going to pay the life insurance out to you in full so you get it while you're still alive.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : That way you can use that to help with things like medical costs, as well as that way you can plan for the future accordingly with your wife rather than her having to wait for you to pass away to receive that benefit.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, that's fine.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : But Jiten, I have got a quote loaded up for you for the 500,000.
[5 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Before we go through that though, is there any questions? So far, we're all sounding pretty straightforward.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : No, no, that's fine. That's fine. I just wanted to make it simple one as with you.
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : All right, perfect. All for yourself to 10 for 500,000 of cover. We're looking at an indicative payment of $113.96 per fortnight. Now of course, your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year or sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : But of course, you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year. But your 10 is an indication if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year, I'm just waiting for that to load up, would be $134.97 per fortnight, but your benefit would have increased to $525,000.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : And of course, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. Chetan, I wanted to ask you today as well, though, did you currently have anything in place for funeral costs? Uh, no.
[7 minutes][Customer] : No.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, Well, the reason I ask you that question is because included in this policy is a funeral advance which is $10,000. That's your loved ones. Your wife can request to be paid upfront all the rest of the claims being assessed.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So they have that to help with those immediate costs like funeral and any other final expenses at the time.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, that's fine.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : But you tend for the 500,000 for yourself at $113.96 per fortnight. Do you feel that that would be affordable and suitable?
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : It is fortnight. So if I had to include my wife, what would be the total premium for both of them?
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Oh, let's have a look.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Uh, provina PRAVINA yeah.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Can I just confirm please, your wife's name and same last name as you and just her date of birth please?
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : KHAT I I Date of birth date 2nd November 1972.
[8 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : And can I confirm she's a female Australian resident?
[8 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : And has she had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Nope.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK. And of course, based on her age, she can actually look from 100,000 up to 500,000. Would you be looking at something like 500,000, the same amount as you?
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yes, same, same amount as me.
[8 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, so let's get that loaded up.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : And can you just tell me for both of us in a monthly if possible?
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yes, of course. I'll look that up for you. So you're paying monthly at the moment, are you?
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's right.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So if we're looking monthly, so for 500,000 for yourself, if we're changing it to monthly would be $246.91 per month for Provina, it would be a Hun two, $126.85 per month. So the total for both of you would be $373.76 per month.
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[9 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So for the half a million of cover for both of you, you tended you feel that that would be affordable and suitable.
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, that's that's what I'm normally happy at the moment. So I just wanted to check that as well tonight. Yep, your pricing really seems like what I've been paying.
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK all. Glad to hear if the pricing is sounding similar, but it sounds as compare in terms of features and benefits, not only the price, of course. For example, what age does your policy expire?
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : So that, so that's it. I don't know that part actually, because the policy hasn't expired.
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Because I can tell you with our life in with our life insurance that yeah, continues as long as you continue to pay premiums, it can continue the same place as a lifetime cover. There isn't actually an expiry age, I bet. Of course you can't comment on your exact insurance terms and conditions, but there are insurers out there where they may have an expiry age.
