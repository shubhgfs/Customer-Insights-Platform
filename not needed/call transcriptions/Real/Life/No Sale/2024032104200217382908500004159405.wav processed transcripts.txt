[1 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : 3149 yeah uh, look, I don't want to disclose everything, but I just want the price, how much the monthly will be.
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : No problem. I'll take you through pricing in a moment. I was this your first time looking to life insurance? Yes.
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's, that's fine. Yeah.
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : It's your first time. Yeah. All right. Well, A and the idea behind you having a life insurance coverage is to cover anything specific for you, like a mortgage. Or is it just financial protection for you and your loved ones?
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah. Just for like to protect.
[1 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, that is financial protection for the loved ones. Well, look, Jess, it's designed to do that, give you Peace of Mind that you've got the financial protection that you need for you and your loved ones. It covers you also worldwide. So if you're travelling overseas, rest assured you're covered and there are terms. And our life insurance cover has no age expiry, so it won't expire if you do in a certain age either. Got that Peace of Mind as well? OK Al? Alright, now to apply. By the way, the process is also a simple one. We run through a series of health and lifestyle questions with you over the phone to see if you are approved. If you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause. OK. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months, OK. Also just in in addition to that, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that would mean that if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, we'll pay out your claim in full into your hands and the money could be used for medical costs to ensure you receive best care possible. So think of that also as a financial backing initial that occur, OK, We also include $10,000 advance payment to help out with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. So as you can see, it's all together in one package also for your convenience as well.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, right now before I get into the pricing for you, do you have any questions for me so far about life insurance cover? OK, that's fine. So let's get straight to some quotes together. Now to begin with, just have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? OK, well that's a great start. And then certainly lower the premiums as well. Let's look at the options you've got. You've options are between 100,000 and $1,000,000 to get yourself covered. What level of cover were you after?
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Does it cover yourself $1,000,000? OK, so let's look at that level then for you. So Jess, if you're choosing $1,000,000, which is the highest level here, OK, By the way, the amounts you choose, you're not locked in to the amounts you choose today. So even if you were to choose a lower amount and you decided later on you wanted more coverage, you can do that and be subject to your eligibility at that point in time as well, OK? But if you're choosing $1,000,000 today to get yourself covered, you're paying $58.12 a fortnight, which is $29.06 a week, and that will get you covered for $1,000,000 with all those benefits. How does that sound to you so far? Very good.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that sounds good, but I need bit of time. Give me little bit of time.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Let me discuss with family and hopefully we yes or need.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I understand that. Yeah, just I understand you need the time to speak with the family and there's no problem there at all. What we like to do, first of all, here at Wheel Insurance is establish your level of cover somewhat you'd be looking at. We go through some health and lifestyle questions so we can determine whether you actually are eligible or not because we don't waste your time that way. And then, yes, I'll be in a position to leave to send you out whatever you require from us today. I'll present with an option right at the end. And then that way you can, you know, have an opportunity to review and discuss it there with your family like you mentioned.
