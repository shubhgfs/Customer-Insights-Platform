All right, well, I'm really sorry to hear that, but I can definitely help. We do require the cancellation in writing. So if you don't have that information, I'm more than happy to help you. But if you don't mind me asking, you've had the fee with us for quite a number of years now. Over. Yes, it's December 2020. How come you're looking at letting it go now? What's happened changed for you?

[1 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, right. OK. Well, I'm really sorry to hear about the circumstances. I can see throughout the years you've actually grown. It's about $121,551.00 worth of cover. It's the 2361 a fortnight. So your premiums reflect the benefit amount that you have. So your benefit amount keeps growing in value every year. Did you have any other protection in place? Any other life cover at all there, Kahu? OK. No, no, no, no offering to to give you more coverage. I was just checking to see if you had anything else in place because with the policy, I'm not sure if you're aware, but not only your cover suggests due to any cause, but we do have protection in the policy for you as well. So you've got your terminal illness advance payment, which is what if you'll diagnose the 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, you can actually claim your benefit in full as a living benefit. It's also $10,000 advance for funeral. So they've got that input in the policy.
