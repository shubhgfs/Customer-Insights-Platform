[6 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep. No, that's alright. It's going awry between my relationship with my sister. She's really just, I don't know. I mean, she's been incredibly petty at times.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : All right, so OK with umm, so, so if you don't mind me asking, I don't want to intrude too much, but why, why have you why have you decided to look into getting cover for for you that at the moment for funeral insurance, right?
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : So with all this going astray and everything, I don't really want her in full control of his Funeral arrangements. So yeah, it's, it's the worst thing. And it happened with me mother as well, but with me older brother.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yep, right.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : And then now for me father, 'cause he's he's got cancer and we're just trying to see it throwing her through meetings and everything like that. And it's just saying, I don't know. She's been incredibly petty. So I'm just looking into maybe handling so much of it myself so I don't get cut out of what actually happens with him by the end of it.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Alright, alright, mate, I'm sorry to hear about that. That's not nice.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, hopefully things change.
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it's, it's funny what what siblings can do in a in a time like that, isn't it? My arm? I I'm not like my parents still living, but my nan passed a few years ago and my dad and his two sisters that happened and my dad was the yeah.
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : But either way, yeah, they get N It's such a strange common thing. Hey, that siblings get nasty when like their parent is quite I'll it's it's weird. Yeah, I've heard about it before too.
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Well, well, like my, yeah, my numbers she on especially past and like I everyone kind of lives far. I live close, so I was close to her, but umm, you know, she didn't have a will or anything. My name didn't really have much to leave. But my dad was the villain. Like he went through the house and he took everything he wanted and didn't tell anybody. And, you know, you know, like it was just, no, it wasn't nice.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Like there would have been like plenty of stuff my mum would have wanted me to have for my brother or my sister. Not, you know, my dad just went through and just ransacked the placement. So yeah, I can, I completely understand. That was not the first one I've ever seen, really. It's the first one that's happened to me with my family. So I get where you're coming from. I know it's not nice. And I'm sorry That.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah they they've got nothing like saying I'm not in like anything that he has. I even had them as any **** like it didn't like like 3 years ago, you know what I mean? Like so these days got nothing to take or anything like that. It's just people just trying to get nasty with just being really nasty. Yeah, I guess.
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, I understand. You just wanted to do the right thing, take care of your dad, right?
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah yeah, exactly.
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : I completely understand where you're coming from. That's all. Good, man.
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm seeing it because me mother. So I just want to make sure that they've recovered, he said. As long as they don't have a feeling to come to the end of this company or any other company.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, but sorry, cut, cut, cut him that again there for me, Jack.
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Well, I was, I was talking, I was just telling the mother and the kids like de facto that like it's possible for us to actually have something to do with at the end of his funeral or the funeral company. Either way, he can have multiple. That's what I was trying to let her know.
[9 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Again, we don't have any say what what you know you do elsewhere. Just with us, you're going to be able to go up to a certain amount of coverage. And I did a search for his name, nothing popped up. So it's all good with us. If you want to get this done, you can. So let me explain it to you, mate.
[9 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All good.
[9 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Please jump in and tell me if you want me to repeat anything, I don't mind and I will make sure you understand everything.
[9 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Cool.
[9 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, so realistically the, the funeral insurance here with us at Real, it's designed to provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 so that you can, ah well, so your dad can leave the money to the loved ones of his choice when he passes away. So realistically, if you want to take the funeral insurance out for him on his behalf, that's fine. That's all good.
[10 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's what I plan on doing. Yeah.
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : You just need to obviously he he would just need to Yep.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : But I understand this time round, I I probably will just leave it to hopefully all goes well. But like, things are getting quite bad. Like, yeah, but hopefully he makes it out and like, you know, this is something that might go on or I shut down for maybe, you know, 10 years because being 69 as it dance and then being getting ill and stuff like that. He it's BA. It's about, it's probably. It's about time we looked at it. Yeah.
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : That's right. So pretty much realistic of what happens is if you're going to take this out from that's fine. He'll still need to sign the beneficiary form and you obviously just fill it out so that that's who will get the money, right?
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep, he's actually Yep, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yep.
[11 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So go ahead.
[11 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Is there any way to get actual because with my mind, I believe they would have had to because she was incredibly I'll for like those good. You know for the last half of my later life that she was in it in saying that more or less. I mean she was more or less incapacitated mentally from about my from about 13 onwards and she passed when I was about 20 when I was about 232425. Yeah, something I really don't look on in a dark thing, but been saying that I think my sister had to have a power training or something 'cause mum was compa.
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, Is your how's your dad at the moment? Does he still take care of his own finances and make his own financial decisions?
[11 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. When he's Yep. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.
[11 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : That's fine. Realistically, what happens is you take a policy, there's going to be a beneficiary form that comes with the documents. He needs to sign it. That's it.
[11 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[12 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, you can, you can.
[12 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : All right. And yeah.
[12 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : You can set it up and pay for it.
[12 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Mm. Hmm.
[12 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : He just needs to make sure that that he signs that form so you can pick up the five people to receive the money on his behalf.
[12 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : If he just wants to pick you, that's fine. You can just pick 1. He just needs to make sure he signs that form and you can send it back. That's it.
[12 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So that at the time of the claim, if you're the beneficiary and you call and make the claim, then you'll you're allowed to make the claim. The money goes to you. No one else can call up and claim it if they're not the beneficiary. Does that make sense? Yeah.
[12 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand that.
[12 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So, so, so once you take it, that would be the only thing that needs to be signed and sent back the beneficiary form is that.
[12 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I probably it's Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[12 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Alright then. Cool. Cool.
[12 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[12 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. What?
[12 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So it's nice and simple.
[12 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : What are your what? Oh, darn it. Yeah. What are your terms and conditions?
[12 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So what?
[12 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Can you tell them all about it on his house? Really, 'cause I know that that's a big questionable one. Like whether 'cause I think people.
[12 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So, so So what I'm so if you just give me give me a give me a SEC J because I'm going to explain everything. I'm going to answer all of this for you. It's pretty straightforward.
[12 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Fair enough.
[12 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : I was I was already going to touch on these things because you did let me know you're sick already. OK, mate.
[12 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So I will make sure it's all straightforward and you can make an informed decision if you want to take this through or not.
[13 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[13 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, So pretty much again, the cover designed to provide a cash benefits to leave a large lump sum of money to the beneficiary of his choice so that they can take care of the funeral expenses. If there's any money leftover after the funeral is paid full, the rest of the money can still be spent however the beneficiary wants to spend it.
[13 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I'm seeing that.
[13 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So whether that's on final expenses like unpaid bills, the bike, or just on themselves, it's really up to that person.
[13 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[13 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, as I was mentioning, he can choose up to five beneficiaries, but if he just wants to pick one, that's fine, I'll just get the whole amount.
[13 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[13 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, now there's a few benefits, so I just want to go through one by one. I'll give you an example on each. OK, so the first benefit is accidental death, Jay. OK, so if the person insured suffers an accidental death at any time, this policy is enforced from start to finish, which is between now and the age of 100.
[13 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : The selected benefit amount will be tripled and paid out to that person's beneficiary.
[14 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK cool. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I Yeah, yeah.
[14 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So in the in the case where you have a $10,000 benefit and the person suffers an accidental death, that becomes 30 grand 30,000 and that could be something as simple as a fall, could be a car accident. If the person passes away within 90 days of the accident 1st occurring, that will still be a triple payout. OK, Does that make sense?
[14 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that makes clear sense. Yeah. Yep.
[14 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : That's the first benefit.
[14 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Just gonna get out of that. Yep.
[14 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now the second benefit is accidental serious injury.
[14 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[14 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So before the policy anniversary, after the person insured 75th birthday, if that person would have suffered an accidental serious injuries such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit of man will also be tripled in this case.
[14 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. Yeah.
[14 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Does that make sense?
[14 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[14 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[14 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. What? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Hmm.
[14 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So if that happens, if that happens to him, he'll most likely still be alive, Jay.
[14 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So what what would happen there is the tripled amount would be paid to him so he can use the money for things like medical costs or care or bills, whatever he needs to spend it on. OK.
[15 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Is it possible, man?
[15 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Now if he does get Yep, Yep. OK.
[15 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Oi, I gotta honestly ask, bro, is it possible 'cause my mum was incompatible entirely for the last like probably about 20-4 months of her life, would it have been doubled or tripled?
[15 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Umm, I'm not sure, man. I'm I'm not sure what.
[15 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : What you're saying in like it's not, it's not like a full like she didn't go through something that like suddenly made her just like quadriplegic. She just lost like mobility entirely due to like seizures that she had.
[15 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So I'm not sure because I don't know what cover they had. Do you know what I mean?
[15 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[15 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : I'm not.
[15 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : But like with the I'm, I'm just trying to say like in most, because you're mostly someone with experience in most cases, what's the percentage likelihood in a number, like as in a percentage number that someone would actually get their policy tripled because they actually have lost. And like medically, there was like a heap of doctors that helped us like through palliative care and everything, like giving her stuff to get her yeah, like what she needed for bathing and everything and like the bed was bed sore safe or whatever. Would her stuff like been tripled her payment and and all that information that I've given you, would that most likely be a case of where like, you know, 80 percent, 85%, they would have actually tripled a payout?
[16 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So again, I, I, well, I don't know mate, because I don't know what where the cover was that you know, your mum had. Do you know what I mean?
[16 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So I don't I can talk.
[16 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Because like if my dad loses full capacity, is that like it's PO, it's very possible, man, that he might lose capacity. But yeah, I don't know.
[16 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So it's it's only due to an accident.
[16 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[16 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So what what you were expecting?
[16 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah.
[16 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[16 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[16 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So what with what you're explaining, that was like a medical condition that caused.
[16 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : There. There we go. I mean, yeah, exactly, man. You'll cleared it all up. That's not accidental. Yeah. There we go.
[16 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
[16 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : All right. Cleared up. No probs. Yep. Yep.
[16 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So, So that that would be at work with us. But again, I don't know about the policy that your sister had for your mom. I don't know. Right.
[17 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. It seems like a broad policy that you guys have that most probably would. Yeah. Seems like a broad policy. Yeah.
[17 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So what well, well, I've, I've, I've only got only got into two benefits. So for my, there's quite a bit more.
[17 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Oh, really?
[17 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So, umm, just just with that one, OK, we give you a, quite a few things in this.
[17 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[17 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So just with that one benefit there the the accidental serious injury benefits. So that's where your dad will get paid out.
[17 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : And did you say took in a four just before that? If they took in a four?
[17 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so let let me explain because umm, I want to get get, I don't want to confuse you too much, right?
[17 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Bear with me there. Just give me one SEC. All right? So I'm just going to explain to you 2 definitions if you can just let me write them out first.
[17 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[17 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so accident means an event resulting in bodily injury occurring while the life insured is covered under the policy where the injuries directly and solely caused by unintentional, accidental, violent, external and visible names without any other contributing causes and whether injuries not intentionally self-inflicted. Now that definition fits into accidental death. So that's the first benefit we've already gone through. So accidental death means death occurring is the direct resolver, an accident and where the death occurs within 90 days of the accident. So that's the accidental death benefit.
[18 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Can you?
[18 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, now the accident.
[18 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Oh, you mean can you? I'm sorry to ask you this, but could you read that whole thing again once more, please? Just that same thing that.
[18 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yup. Yup.
[18 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So just remember, man, umm, accidental death is different. Accidental serious injury. OK.
[18 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
[18 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So don't, don't get confused between the two. One is if you die, the other one is if you're still alive.
[18 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yup.
[18 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, so accident means an event resulting in bodily injury occurring while the life insured is covered under this policy where the injuries directly and solely caused by unintentional accidental violence and external and visible means without any other contributing causes and whether injuries not intentionally self-inflicted. Now the reason I'm waiting about definition is because it fits into the accidental death definition. So accidental death means death occurring as the direct result of an accident and whether death occurs within 90 days of the accident. So if you don't have a car accident and he passed away within 90 days of that accident 1st occurring, that's a triple payout. OK, so that's accidental death and the example now the next one is accidental serious injury.
[19 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, so there we go. I'll pop this back up.
[19 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[19 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, so with accidental serious injury, the way this works is before the policy anniversary following your dad's 75th birthday. Between now and that day, if he were to suffer an accidental serious injury such as quadaplasia or paraplasia, the benefit amount will also triple.
[20 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Between now and the 75th birthday.
[20 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So if he's in a car accident and he doesn't pass away, policy anniversary is the day you first pay for the, uh, make payment for cover. Umm, so, and it'll be that same day every year after.
[20 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Sorry.
[20 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, so policy anniver.
[20 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : And you're saying the time's in between?
[20 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yep, between now and the policy anniversary after your dad's 75th birthday, so he'll turn 75.
[20 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[20 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : The next policy anniversary after that birthday is when this benefit will stop. Just this one alone.
[20 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[20 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK. So just remember, someone would have called and get this covered now and that were already 75. They wouldn't even get this benefit that I'm explaining to you.
[20 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[20 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[20 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : That's what I understand that. Yeah.
[20 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah.
[20 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[20 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So just remember if you if you.
[20 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Just a moment. Are you still there?
[20 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[20 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Aren't you there?
[20 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[20 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK. Is it possible to let my de facto just listening to this because there's some of the information is a bit it means something maybe? Yeah, Yeah. Is that possible?
[21 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it's OK. That's fine.
[21 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Could you just ask just the policy on accidental and just those please once more and we should be able to get straight through everything else.
[21 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right, man. I'll just let your partner know as well. All calls are recorded. Any advice that provides general in nature may not be suitable to your situation as well. What was your full name and date of birth there, Joh?
[21 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Johnny JAH double N i.e. i.e.
[21 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Double nie, Johnny. Yeah.
[21 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep and Jacob Yep.
[21 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Jacobs.
[21 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : JAEODS. Yep.
[21 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : And what? What's your date of birth, Johnny?
[21 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : 16th and Bothman St.
[21 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, Thank you again. My name's Guy. I'm from real Insurance. OK. Umm.
[21 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Are you there? Hello.
[21 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Now, as I was explaining the cover for funeral insurance, Yeah. Yeah. Can you hear me, mate?
[21 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[21 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Are you still there?
[21 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : You there?
[22 minutes][Agent] : Yep.
[22 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[22 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[22 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Alright, Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. Please do that. Calls you. Please.
[22 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, say that again.
[22 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : If you could just ask me. Accidental death and accidental serious harm.
[22 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : I'll just, I'll start again because I'm still at the start anyway. Umm, Jay.
[22 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So it's, it's all good.
[22 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[22 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So, so pretty much umm, to go over it nice and clear. The funeral insurance is designed to provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 so that the money can be left in full to the person person's beneficiary when they pass away. The beneficiary can use the money in full with complete freedom however they want. So funeral expenses, any other final expenses such as unpaid bills, etcetera. The person insured to nominate up to five beneficiaries if they want to receive the money on their behalf, If they just want to choose one, that's fine. That person will get the entire amount. Now with the benefits, there's quite a few, so I'm going to go through each one and give you an example on each. So the first one's accidental death. So if the person insured suffers an accident for death from start to finish while the policy is in force, which is between the now and the age of 100, the selected benefit amount will be triples and paid out to the beneficiary. As an example, this could be something as simple as a full. It could be something like a Yep.
[23 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : You're right.
[23 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So again, it could be something simple as a fall, could be something like a car accident. And if the person in short passes away within 90 days of that accident 1st occurring, that will be a triple payout. So in other words, if you had a $15,000 benefit and an accident that is to happen, $45,000 would be paid to the beneficiary. Does that make sense? Yeah. And what about for you, Jay? Does that make sense? Yes. So I just remember I need you to make sure you're taking the range of umm, answering yes or no as well.
[23 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, and I know it's OK if you don't need to be on the phone, but as you want the one doing the insurance. OK, Now the second benefits, accidental serious injury. Sorry, before the policy anniversary following the person in shorts 75th birthday, between now and that day, if that person in short were to suffer an accidental serious injuries such as quadriplasia or paraplasia for example. So let's say Ricky has a car accident. He doesn't pass away, but he becomes a quadriplegic, which means you can't use his arms or his legs anymore. OK, that would be an example. In this case, the benefit amount would be triples. The triple amount will be paid to Ricky so that he can use the money for medical costs, a carer, really whatever he needs to spend it on that it expense like his bills to survive. The original funeral benefit will still remain in place as well after this so that there is still still something paid out for the funeral at the end of the day, even though Ricky's been paid out the triple amount while he's alive in that scenario. Does that make sense?
[24 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[24 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[24 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I understand.
[24 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, cool. Any questions at all about that, Jay?
[24 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : No.
[24 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : No, all good. Now. There is no medical checks for this cover. It is a guaranteed acceptance for Australian residents between age 40 and 79. OK, so you do not need to jump through any hoops to get this for Ricky and you know, people that are sick already, they can still come and get this policy too. OK. Now in that regard, this is very important. Jay, you did ask about this a bit earlier, and I want to make sure this is very straightforward and clarified for you. For the 1st 12 months, Ricky will only be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury, which are the 1st 2 benefits we've already gone through.
[25 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[25 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, after holding the policy for the 1st 12 months, at that point moving forward, Ricky will then also be covered for debt due to any cause.
[25 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I know that name.
[25 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Now this means plain and simple, natural causes are not covered in the first four months for anybody that first get to cover like this.
[25 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[25 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Umm, as people that ask you can come and get this to like, you know, cable with cancers or lung conditions or terminal illnesses, they can still get this like you and I, but that doesn't mean they can turn around and claim on that previous in condition two weeks after getting the policy.
[25 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, exactly. It's gotta be probably 12 months. Yeah, exactly, bro. I know that one.
[25 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, yeah, cool, cool. So yeah, after holding the policy for the first four months, Ricky will then be covered. So that's due to any calls.
[26 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[26 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Umm, we also will cover Ricky for a terminal illness benefit as well, Jay. Umm, so after you do hold the policy for the first four months, at that point, if Ricky were then first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, umm, then you can actually make the, he can make the call and claim himself and get paid out in full.
[26 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Could you, could you say that one, please? Yeah.
[26 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so yeah, it's the terminal illness benefit.
[26 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[26 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So, so again, after holding the policy for the 1st 12 months, if Ricky would then first diagnosed with the terminal illness such as a terminal cancer, umm, with 12 months or less to leave, confirmed by a medical practitioner, then Ricky can call and make the claim and get paid out in full while he's alive.
[26 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[26 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So you can give the money to the beneficiary early to organize the funeral or, you know, he may even need to spend the money on medical costs to get the best care, Right.
[26 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[26 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So that's built in just in case as well. Does that all make sense so far?
[27 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, it does. Yeah. Of course they didn't. Yeah.
[27 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yes, I, I hope that doesn't ever happen, mate. I've been through that with one of my best mate's dads and it was terrible.
[27 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll be honest on on like my, my what I mean, I hope you guys end up like quit getting money out of hand and I never get paid out or **** you know, I hope I never have to use it.
[27 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So yes, yes.
[27 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : No one speak, you know, I hope, I hope I lose. That's the honesty I hope I think was.
[27 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Well, yeah, then that's well, well, this is going to be that a whole time for Ricky, mate. OK. So obviously it is inevitable we'll have our time, but hopefully it's not for a long time for Ricky, for your sake as well mate. Umm, so pretty much the way the cover works, umm, that's that's it there's a bit more to it. I just want to get you the price first, then I'll explain to you what the rest of the cover does OK, It's very straightforward.
[27 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : But anyways, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Umm now Jay, you can choose what you want to ensure Ricky full umm, we'll make sure it's affordable for you. Umm the minimum amount of cover is 3000, the maximum is 15,000.
[27 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[28 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : You can go in the middle of this, this range in $500 increments.
[28 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : By a long shot young man, he's from, he's from New Zealand both and he's got kids in New Zealand with kids. So like people will come from far and wide though to if it all works and and he's got double. My sister almost had one on him, but she was yeah, go ahead, mate.
[28 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, Yep, Yep, did, did, did, did, did he still, did he live in Australia or did he live in New Zealand?
[28 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. No, he's an Australian citizen since I've been here, man, he, I've, I'm the youngest man everyone and I'm thirty this year.
[28 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[28 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : So, yeah, he's been. Yeah, all of it.
[28 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : And he still, he still resides here in Australia.
[28 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[28 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep. That's, that's fine.
[28 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : You see this stuff, You've got a Medicare number and things like that. No problem. Yes, thank you.
[28 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So say that again.
[28 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : You've got a Medicare number, everything like that. No problem. Just trying to do the simple short.
[28 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Oh, no, that's fine. That's OK. As long as he lives here. That's the main thing. Yep. And then once he has it, if he does, you know, decide to move back to New Zealand at any point, he can still keep his cover in place as long as it's paid in Australian dollars from an Australian bank account.
[28 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's not going back. He said this place isn't home now. So yeah, but it will probably come from back there when he, when he like he gets real close to death it like in maybe the next five years. So if they're told like there's enough to probably, you know, bring your kids over and stuff that none of us have even met too. You know, he's got a lot of history, bro. He, he comes from, yeah.
[29 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's fair enough. That's all.
[29 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : But yeah, it'll it'll help to get back up his story, I think.
[29 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Well, at the end of the day, mate, it can still stay in place even if he does move back. I know he's probably not gone, but if he did, as long as the payments are made in Australian dollars from an Australian bank account, it'll cover him worldwide 24/7 anyway. OK. Umm, now, umm, $15,000 of cover will cost you $69.79 a fortnight, Jay.
[29 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand.
[29 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Umm is that is, is that going to be affordable for you?
[29 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : I will have to crunch the numbers with my extra factor, obviously, so that you're more than a thing, $60.70. See how much?
[30 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, $69.79 a fortnight. That's the biggest amount we can offer. The 15,000.
[30 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : 69, yeah, yeah, fine. 26, yeah, yeah, fine. No, no, no. I'll have to crunch the numbers on that one. That's about all.
[30 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Did you want me to lower that or so?
[30 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Because like when I told you I'd probably take a loss and if I knew that it's not going to be a cheap $9 nine a week, $9 nine a week funeral cover. No puts up. I understand that, mate. It's cool. It's cool. But yeah, yeah, yeah. Proceed for the full maximum of that.
[30 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, So obviously I can help you with the numbers, mate. Just keep in mind with this cover, you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount.
[30 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine. Yeah.
[30 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : And please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment elements. So if you cancel outside of 30 days, your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back. OK umm, so yeah, at the end of the day that's the biggest amount mate, 15,000, so it's going to be the most expensive 1 So 60 dollars, $69.79 a fortnight.
[30 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[30 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Umm, let's say we looked at 10,000 to get it a bit cheaper for you, that'll be $46.53 a fortnight.
[31 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : No, It's, it's got to be Yeah, 1915 thousand. No problem. Then we can, we can handle that, man. It's it's got to be seriously, just I'll get to it. No problem. Then it's it, Yeah.
[31 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Alright that's fine that's all good then. Umm, there's a bit more to it anyway, let me just explain the rest and I'll give you a chance to ask me some questions. So umm, the premium you pay on this cover, your premiums are level, which means they are designed to stay consistent and the same year on year as the person in short gets older.
[31 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[31 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Now, that is only up until Ricky turns 85, J So on Ricky's 85th birthday, 33 things will happen to this policy. I'm going to tell you about them all now, one by one. OK, So when Ricky turns 85, the first thing that happens is that the premiums will stop and you will not have to pay for this any longer, OK? But the cover will stay in place up until Ricky turns 100, which means between 85 and 100, which is still covered. You just don't need to pay in that time. So that makes sense.
[32 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[32 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Is that, do you need the premium by the entire amount? Oh, lovely. Oh, Yep. Cool. Cool.
[32 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Any question the premium stop altogether, you don't need to pay for it anymore, right?
[32 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[32 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So from from 80, from his 85th birthday, from that day onwards, cover still saves in place up into 100, but no more payments.
[32 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Alright, Cool. Yep, Yep.
[32 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, right now, that's the first thing. So the second thing that happens when Ricky turns 85 is that we give a bonus cover that gets automatically applied on top of the $15,000 benefit amount so that Ricky will be covered for more money.
[32 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[32 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, That will increase it to 25%. Bonus cover, it'll increase to 15K up to $18,750.
[32 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[32 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, now I'd like to look at this three ways.
[32 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah. Yep.
[32 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So if Ricky passes between now and 85, then we know that the $15,000 benefit is payable unless if it's an accidental death, for example, where it triples to $45,000 right now.
[33 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep. Yep.
[33 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : If Ricky passes away between 85 and 100, then that's where we now know the benefit and the bonus covers payable, which is a total of $18,750 right now.
[33 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[33 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : If it is an accidental death between 85 and 100, then the $18,750 will triple to $56,250. Does that make sense?
[33 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : What's that? Yep.
[33 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So if it's an accidental death between 85 and 100 for Ricky, then the benefit and the bonus cover together, which equals $18,750.
[33 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Alright, no problem.
[33 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : That amount in full will get tripled and that and that'll go to $56,250.
[33 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, Yeah.
[34 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, now the third scenario is very rare. I don't really know many people that have made it to this age myself.
[34 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[34 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : But if he does make it to 100, the cover will finish at that age for Ricky. OK.
[34 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[34 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : What will then happen is the benefit and the bonus cover will be released to Ricky so he can put it aside or give it to the beneficiary or spend it right. And, and, and that, that'll be the $18,750. OK, so you can say that, uh, there are a number of ways that this could potentially be paid out. Uh, so you know how it gets paid out to whom it goes to and how much gets paid. Uh, it all depends on what happens first. As long as the premiums are paid up until the age of 85 for Ricky.
[34 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[34 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, does that make sense?
[34 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yep. No problem.
[34 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yep. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website too, Of course.
[34 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[34 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Umm OK, now there's one more benefit.
[34 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[35 minutes][Agent] : OK Uh, it will become available when Ricky turns 85. Whether or not he asks for it is his choice. OK, It is called the early cash out option. So at anytime after Ricky reaches 85 years of age or over, he can choose to end his own cover if he wants to.
[35 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[35 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : If he does this, we will pay him 75% of his funeral insurance benefit and he could spend that 75% how he wants and the cover finishes right?
[35 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[35 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So that's realistically there in case the person needed spare money, OK. Again, it doesn't need to be asked for. If you just keeps it in place, you're not paying any more from 85 onwards anyway and you're going to be covered for the benefit in the bonus cover at that point. If I if the early cash option is requested, the bonus cover is not included and 75% of 15,000 will equal $11,250 mate. OK. So just keep that in mind, whether or not he asked for that is his choice.
[35 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK Umm, now that's how the cover works in full. Ah, we send out a free will kit with the policy in case Ricky needs to organize or update a will for himself. Umm, and we, we do pay you some money back. This money is going to come to you Jake, as you're paying for the policy. Umm, we call this a real reward. So following your first policy anniversary date, we will refund you 10% of the premiums you've paid in that time as a thank you.
[36 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[36 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So you will get back $181 and $0.46 and you can spend that however you like.
[36 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Alright, cool.
[36 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So that's called the real reward. OK, now just to confirm, can I please confirm you are authorized to purchase this policy on behalf of the insured for Ricky?
[36 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : What does that mean? That I can definitely get a signature?
[36 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : No, not that just do you have the authority to purchase this on behalf of Ricky?
[36 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : What does that mean exactly?
[36 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So like is like I are you allowed to do this for him or well, you are your son, right?
[36 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm gonna, when I see him and like, you know, he's up to it. I'll talk to him about it in depth. But yeah, I need to know more about the pros and cons and the information about it.
[37 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, well, that I've, I've explained it to you in full.
[37 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah.
[37 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So is there any questions for me like yet? Do you what do you have any concerns or anything you want me to clear up for you?
[37 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[37 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : No.
[37 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[37 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So in that regard is when someone's taking out a policy on behalf of someone else, we just need to confirm that you have the authority to do that.
[37 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I guess.

[57 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK. Umm, with this one, obviously I have a dozen up until you mate, but there's no waiting period on it.
[58 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep. OK.
[57 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : If you get diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner that's with a terminal illness, then you call yourself, you make the claim, you get paid out in full, OK, So that way you can decide how the money spent. So your medical costs, you might want to set your family up. You might want to take off a bucket list with your family so you can create those memories. It's really up to you, OK, There's, there's also a funeral benefit built into this cover.
[58 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[58 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : It's a $10,000 advance payment so that when your beneficiaries claim, they can request that and use it for funeral costs and final expenses.
[58 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[58 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that's how the life cover works. Is there any questions?
[58 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : No. No questions. No.
[58 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK. Oh, good. And you said you wanted to look at the maximums, the million?
[58 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[58 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[58 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Definitely. Yep.
[58 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So we can offer you the $1 million of coverage I, umm, for a fortnightly premium of $93.07.
[58 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK, how much for? What am I?
[58 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, Do you want? So what I might do is I'll give you the breakdown 1st and then we can move upwards. Is that OK? Might make it a bit easier.
[59 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, Sir.
[59 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : I'll get also.
[59 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[59 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : I'll get, I'll still get you the quarter, but just just so you can say it nice and simple.
[59 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[59 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Per $100,000 of cover, it'll cost you $9.31 a fortnight, right? So each $100,000 extra you want to just keep in mind it will be an extra $9.31 per 100,000 that you add on.
[59 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[59 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, So for for 1/4, so 250,000 you'd be looking at just loading up now $23.27 a 49. How does that sound?
[59 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : That's probably the one. How much for? How much was 400,000?
[59 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, just load it up for you. And what? Remember whatever you choose here Jays, just to start on. OK, umm, let me, let me just explain this here while I'm loading that price. So if someone starts lower than the maximum, that person can call back before they turn 65 and apply for a large increase on their benefit. The thing is, uh, the eligibility is you need to get approved again before you turn 65 through the questions to look at increasing large amounts and what it'll depend on when you call to. So whatever your age is when you call, umm, and you, if you do get approved again, uh, you'll then be showing what your options are increasing in large amounts and you can pick and choose from your options at that time.
[59 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm. Hmm.
[1 hours 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that's one option. Some people might start high and then they might not need that much later. So you can apply to decrease at any time. If you applied a decrease to cover, the payments will lower accordingly. OK, so again, just to just explain that to me so that you know, whatever you're choosing here, it's just to start on, there are ways subject to eligibility to have this change over time, OK? Umm, so for 400,000 that would be $37.23 a fortnight.
[1 hours 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll, I'll put it down for 750, man. I'll, I'll make it 750.
[1 hours 1 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Southeast 750, So that would be, uh, $69.80 a fortnight.
[1 hours 1 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No problem. Yeah, that's the number, man. Yeah.
[1 hours 1 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, You can, yeah.
[1 hours 1 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : It's it's just enough for what I need, for everyone that's around me that I care for and it's not too party to.
[1 hours 1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK. So you can afford that as well.
[1 hours 1 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, def. I can definitely afford that one and it'd still be enough. You get it right?
[1 hours 1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK Yeah. So you're right to cover both the funeral for your data in this one.
[1 hours 1 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's gonna be, it's gonna be a bit like, I don't know how it's gonna be when I talk to like when I let it be known that like I need a signature and this what's happening. So it, it might not be immediate, but, but yeah. Oh, so I'll pay this one first. No problem. Yeah. So yeah, let's get this one happening.
[1 hours 1 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK All right. So you want to so remember the other ones in place already in the first time?
[1 hours 1 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 1 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : It'll be on the 14th of February. That's OK. Yeah.

[1 hours 2 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : All right. Right. So so, umm, do you want to do this one as well?
[1 hours 2 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. For, yeah. For 7:50. Yeah. Yep. No problem.
[1 hours 2 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK, 750,000 Alright, alright, no worries. Alright cool.

[1 hours 4 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm. Yep.
[1 hours 4 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : As an example, the premium payable in the following year of cover would be $69.80 a fortnight and the benefit amount would remain the same as the $750,000 for that next 12 month period as well.

Like after this phone call, I get in contact with the family doctor and just say to him, look, I've already got the policy and it could cost me about 70 bucks for in the next fortnight.
[1 hours 16 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So are you able to find that out for me to be very like because I want to make we would do it. We do it the other way around.
[1 hours 16 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : But if you could give me some credible information that relays to Yep. Alright then. OK, thanks.
[1 hours 16 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So you go find that out for me first and then we'll finish it once you know the answer with the live. That's how we do with the life insurance. So you need to be sure it's it's it's not like it's not like the funeral. Remember, the few ones got no questions to be asked, right? So as long as as long as you're an Australian resident between age 40 and 79, you can get a funeral insurance, right? That's guaranteed. Where's this one's not? This one's very strict on the question. So find that out for me, mate. I'll put it on hold. Everything else advanced will save.
[1 hours 16 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 16 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, We don't need to go.
[1 hours 16 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Can tonight W would you personally, would you feel comfortable and just going through and and saying as a yes, 'cause I'd I'd like to get off the phone call and be able to say that like, you know what I mean, me kids and you know, me, the ex old lady, you know, I've got cover.
[1 hours 17 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So I can't do that mate. I'm not allowed to. Yeah, but I can still go through the rest of the. I'll go through the rest for you and then we'll just leave that one blank and you can go and point out for me. We'll come back and answer that last question.
[1 hours 17 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 17 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[1 hours 17 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : All good, all good.
[1 hours 17 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So at the moment I'm going to leave the mental health one is blank as we'll have to answer that later. The next one was, have you ever had symptoms of being diagnosed with or treated for or intend to seek medical advice for any of the following any illegal drug use, abusive prescription medication, or received medical advice or counseling for alcohol consumption? So did you say that you did have medical advice or counseling for alcohol consumption? Yep.
[1 hours 17 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I guess so.
[1 hours 17 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[1 hours 17 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[1 hours 17 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So then it says when I put that in as a yes, it breaks it down further and it says illegal drugs, abusive prescription medication or treatment for drug addiction, IE methadone or Suboxone. Yes or no? No. OK Ah, the next one says have you sought medical advice or counseling for your alcohol consumption within the past 10 years? OK, That's fine. So it's outside of those 10 years.
[1 hours 18 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : No, no, yeah.
[1 hours 18 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine. No change on that. That's great. OK. Umm, moving forwards, next question.
[1 hours 18 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : No, nothing. Nothing.
[1 hours 18 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Disorder of the kidney or bladder, blood disorder or disease, asthma or other spiritual disorder excluding childhood asthma.
[1 hours 18 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : No.
[1 hours 18 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's fine mate. We're doing very well. There's about 5 to go, umm, well, six including the, the, uh, mental health one, but we'll do that when you speak to the doctor, uh, and no change has been made. So if I were doing very well, OK.
[1 hours 18 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[1 hours 19 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Umm, the next one says other than what you have already told me about in the past three years, have you sought medical advice or treatment by a medical practitioner or specialist? Or are you awaiting results for any medical tests or investigations such as they're not limited to any surgeries, X-rays, scans, blood tests or biopsy, Yes or no?
[1 hours 19 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : No.
[1 hours 19 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : And other than what you have already told me about, are you contemplating seeking medical advice or any symptoms you are currently experiencing within the next two weeks?
[1 hours 19 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : No.
[1 hours 19 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : To family history questions for you, Jay.
[1 hours 19 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 hours 19 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : These are only going to ask us about immediate family and that is either father, mother, brother or sisters only.
[1 hours 19 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 hours 19 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, To the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family living or deceased ever being diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, Huntington's disease, or familial abernitis, polyposis?
[1 hours 19 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : No.
[1 hours 19 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : To the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family suffered from cancer, heart condition, stroke, or other hereditary disease prior to age 60? So, so only if they were diagnosed before 60.
[1 hours 20 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah. No, no, not before. No. Yeah, my dad's older.
[1 hours 20 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So, so, so, so your mom or your dad not before 60, older than that yet, OK. And and your mom didn't get diagnosed with any of those things before 60? OK, OK, that's good. And brothers and sisters, same thing.
[1 hours 20 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no. Right. They're all, they're all quite Instead.
[1 hours 20 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, All right, cool. So that would be enough for that whole question, is that right?
[1 hours 20 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
[1 hours 20 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. Thank you.
[1 hours 20 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : No, Yep.
[1 hours 20 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Last question on this section and says other than one of events such as a gift certificate or a voucher for example, Jay, do you, do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fair paying passenger on a recognised airline, motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, upsailing, scuba diving deeper than 40 meters, cable wreck diving or any other hazardous activity? Yes or no?
[1 hours 21 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's yeah.
[1 hours 21 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : You do, that's all. Yeah. So remember that. It's it's not a bad thing to say. As to it's all good.
[1 hours 21 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : I do intend to yeah, yes, I but I'm sure there's a design, life insurance pay. But even though it's drag racing, all that sort of stuff, eh, that's just yeah, I'll, I'll. But what does it say if I say yeah to motor racing?
[1 hours 21 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Well, yeah, it's all right. That's fine. It's probably like it might just be a bit more of a risk. It might exclude you for that particular circumstance. Huh. Say that again. But yeah, if you're going to intend to do it, we need to put it down.
[1 hours 21 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : And how many years does that take through W how recent 'cause I won't be probably anything on a track within the next three years, if not longer, probably even longer than that maybe is. Is there a time frame for it or not?
[1 hours 22 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : It's it's in general, Yeah.
[1 hours 22 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Just all in 10 or all all right.
[1 hours 22 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So so I'll write it back slower. So other than so remember A1 off event doesn't count.
[1 hours 22 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 22 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : If it's a one off event, you don't need to say yes. So for example, someone might get given like a certificate for skydiving for Christmas. That's a one off event. Do you know what I mean? Because they're not going to do what every day, they're going to do it once and that's it. But if a, if a skydiving instructor came through and they skydive three times a day because of their job, they'd have to say yes.
[1 hours 22 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 22 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Does that make sense?
[1 hours 22 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 hours 22 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[1 hours 22 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I know.
[1 hours 22 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : All right, cool. I'll write it all back. So and remember, it's, it's it's not right or wrong. Like if you say yes to this, OK, just means you've got to call off. You do cool things, it's all good.
[1 hours 22 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 hours 22 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So other than one of events, for example, gift certificate or vouchers, do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fair paying passenger on a recognized airline? Motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, add sailing, scuba diving deeper than 40 meters, cable wreck diving, or any other hazardous activity. So you wanted me to put a yes for motor racing? Yep, that's fine, it's all good. I need to get rid of the ones that don't apply to you first.
[1 hours 23 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 23 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, so it says based on your response, please enter yes or no for each of the following aviation. Other than this, if they're paying passenger or crew for a recognized passenger airline, yes or no?
[1 hours 23 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I just want to be a passenger. Yeah. I don't intend to do anything else but be a passenger.
[1 hours 23 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Oh, yeah, yes. So remember, other than means, that's OK.
[1 hours 23 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : So that's yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 23 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So that that one's more saying aviation be a flyer plane.
[1 hours 23 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I don't. No, Yeah.
[1 hours 23 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, that, that that's what's that, That's what that one's asking. So aviation other than as a fare paying passenger or crew for a recognised passenger airline, yes or no? Cool. That's fine, man. That's all good mountaineering. What climbing will add sailing, long distance sailing, Hang Gliding, excluding one time glides, Skydiving or parachuting, excluding one time jumps, scuba diving.
[1 hours 23 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1 hours 24 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Then I'm going to put a yes to this next one.
[1 hours 24 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 hours 24 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : It says Motorsports, excluding recreational trail bike riding. So by the sounds of you drive like cars on the track, like drugs, Yeah.
[1 hours 24 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I want, Yeah, I want to get towards that. Yeah, Yep.
[1 hours 24 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : All right, all right. So put a yes for that and says are your motor sport activities limited to auto cross hill climbs, gymkhanas, karting, sprints, only rallies, drag racing Are reliability trials yes or no?
[1 hours 24 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No, none of them.
[1 hours 24 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So what would, what would you be doing?
[1 hours 24 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : No, just the one time track of that. Yeah, Yeah.
[1 hours 24 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : You know what, what, what would the track event they would it be like a rally or would it be a drive race? What would it be?
[1 hours 24 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Was put down a drag. Yeah, Drag. Yeah.
[1 hours 25 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Is that what it is though, Because drives just straight line. So are you doing circuits?
[1 hours 25 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I would say circuit means more than drag. I I never intended to go drag. I intended to go circuit.
[1 hours 25 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So actually like driving around the track like umm, like just like, I don't know what you have up there. I'm, I'm from Sydney.
[1 hours 25 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 25 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So we have, we have Eastern Creek Raceway, so people can just take their cars there and do the tracks and do the time trials and whatnot. Is that what you're going to do?
[1 hours 25 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : I'm just yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 25 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK, so that wouldn't be on the list. So it's fine. I have to put a no for that. Again, we don't want to be answering this wrongly.
[1 hours 25 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : More or less, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 25 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And an exclusion pops up. Yep.
[1 hours 25 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : The only thing I'd like has a lot more power. And like, you know, they're like they're, they're serious like money involved with drag cars. And like, I'm just talking about building cars that were so you don't got to build them through the street legal legality. Like just we can build a car just for track and it makes it less, less constricting on how we build it then you know what I mean? That's that's all we want to do. Yeah.
[1 hours 26 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I know. I I know, I understand. So it's just because that one's obviously not on the list because it's only got order cross hill climbs and Connors karting sprints, only valleys drag racing or the liability trials. So I'll put up. Yeah. So, yeah, Yeah, obviously circuits aren't there, so I'll put a no, which is fine. It does exclude you for it. OK, But just for that one thing. So it says no life benefits shall be payable under this policy for any claim arising as a result of practice for or participation in Motorsports. OK. So you'll still be covered for the rest of the policy in your everyday life, just not when you're doing practice or participation for in Motorsports. Does that make sense? Yeah.
[1 hours 26 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : But yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I'm, I'm more or less than you get, I'll put it in black and white because like I'm up around with cars that much and everything like that. There's the other times that I'm driving around and everything like that. Just normally I end up in car accidents and whatever else because I'm around cars. I explain it because I'm around cars all the time, you know what I mean? So like, it's my career, it's my wife's, all that sort of stuff. So it's trying to happen a car accident once in a while, you know what I mean? And if you just start racking them up, it's just a big hang in my ****. Like you could just. Yeah, it's either bad, not the good.
[1 hours 27 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So, so remember, it's not, it's not excluding you for driving your car down the street legally, it's excluding you for racing, right?
[1 hours 27 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want to be covered for legally in a car accident, like someone just like wiped me out or something like that.
[1 hours 27 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So like, yeah, that's fine, that's fine, but not on a track.
[1 hours 27 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 27 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So.
[1 hours 27 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Understandable. Yeah. But that's right.
[1 hours 27 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So just keep keep in mind, so all it says is no life benefits, you'll be payable under this policy for any claim arising as a result of practice for or participation in Motorsports in general. So if you're just driving your car down the road to go to the shops or something or to work, that's not Motorsports.
[1 hours 27 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Great. That's what we wanted. Yeah. Great.
[1 hours 27 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, that's all good. So just do you understand and agree to that exclusion? Is that OK?
[1 hours 27 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yep. Beauty.
[1 hours 28 minutes][Agent] : Yep, all good. The the last one who says any other hazardous to suits or sports to do anything else?
[1 hours 28 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : No, nothing else.
[1 hours 28 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, all right then, that's all good. So the only change so far was that exclusion for Motorsports mate.
[1 hours 28 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 hours 28 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Umm everything else was good, but we need to find out about the mental health.
[1 hours 28 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I know that. I pick. I pick up my now the Aikenville where we are, our family doctor. I'll give him a call all the way up. Yeah. What do you want to say?
[1 hours 28 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, Umm, Yep, yeah, if you can, if you could.
[1 hours 28 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : But it it was in the sense that they can't really even find anything on record about it anymore because it was such a yeah, yeah, it was such a long time and such a small issue, but they never even really filed an anything, you know?
[1 hours 28 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So what, what do you want to do?
[1 hours 28 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : So what? I Yeah.
[1 hours 28 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : You want to write this question, Jay, if you can write this question down for me, ask them the question. It'll be nice and simple.
[1 hours 28 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Alright, Cool, cool.
[1 hours 28 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So just ask, ask, ask them this question. So just say, did I have any form of schizophrenia, bipolar or psychotic disorder at any point in my life and see what they say.
[1 hours 28 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah.
[1 hours 28 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So do you want me to write? Do you want to write it down? I'll go a bit slower if you like.
[1 hours 28 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Alright then I'll I'll get to that one. Yeah. No, I can, I can. Yeah, I can speak that exactly back to them. Quote UN quote.
[1 hours 29 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, just say, just say schizophrenia by polo, psychotic disorder.
[1 hours 29 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 hours 29 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : I need to confirm whether or not, umm, you've had any of those conditions at any time in your life.
[1 hours 29 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep. No worries. Alright then.
[1 hours 29 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep. Cool. And if we just need to know yes or no, and then we can continue on or like, if I have to put a yes, it's going to be a decline we're not going to be able to cover. But, umm, obviously if you, we need to be telling the truth. So just find out again, I don't want to give you the cover if you're not going to be covered. Does that make sense?
[1 hours 29 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 29 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK.
[1 hours 29 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, Right.
[1 hours 29 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : I'm I'm happy to. Yeah.
[1 hours 29 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Then I'll and then yeah, get back to you.

[1 hours 29 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Do you have a direct number I can call 13 like 1048? Yep.
[1 hours 29 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Just ask the guy. So G for golf, U for uniform, Y for yellow.
[1 hours 29 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Cool. Alright then.

[1 hours 30 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yeah, yeah, I I'm gonna try and call the family doctor, but maybe the one that we've known long enough and then see what he says about on that and then I'll get back to ya.
[1 hours 30 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Well, I'm here for another hour today, mate, so you can get back to me. Give me a call. OK, Well, good.
[1 hours 30 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Alright man, that's got a good plan and thanks for getting me up.
