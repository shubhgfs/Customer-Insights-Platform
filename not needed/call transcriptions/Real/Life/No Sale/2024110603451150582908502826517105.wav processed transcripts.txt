[2 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK umm Now at the end of the day Joanne, if you are happy with what we discussed today for Lester is this are you going to be setting this up for him? No worries, all good. Umm and is this just to for that Peace of Mind and security that when the time comes and he does pass away that you and the family don't actually have to worry about the funeral expenses.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's correct.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Good on you, well done Joanne, I appreciate you letting me know this. In fact, that's exactly what it's designed to do OK.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : And we make a really simple and easy for Felicity to get this insurance umm since he is an Australian resident and well firstly keep in mind calls are recorded. Any advice provided. Certainly nature may not be suitable to your situation.
[3 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, now, since Lester is an Australian resident and he's aged between 40 and 79, we will accept him just the way he is. It's a guaranteed acceptance.
[3 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : He doesn't need to do any medical checks or visit a doctor, OK Umm, even if he has any medical conditions, you won't need to tell us about them either because once again, we will still accept him just the way he is.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Umm no worries, all good. But keep in mind because we're not looking at his medical history at all for the 1st 12 months of this insurance, he's only covered in that time for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. But after the first 12 months this will cover him for death due to any cause at all. OK. It also comes with what we call a terminal illness benefit, which of course I'm touching. I would hoping less than never get to use this, but it is still included for him just in case as a, as a backup.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, now we took on there.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : And this means that after Leicester is, I'm sorry, OK, sure. Umm, So once again, this means that after Leicester has held the policy with us for, uh, the 1st 12 months, uh, if he was first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less salute by medical practitioner. We will then pay out the full funeral insurance amount to him so he can use the money himself before he passes away. Take care of all of his medical expenses to make sure that he gets the best care possible. OK, just checking in with you so far John, is that all pretty straightforward and clear? Very good, very good. Now you can choose how much you want to cover your uncle for umm, we can insure him anywhere from $3000 up to a maximum of 15,000. But what I do want to make sure.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes well I reckon 15 'cause funeral the you wouldn't get anywhere with 3000.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Well, you can go anywhere in between. The minimum is 3000 and then it goes up to a maximum of 15,000. OK, sure, sure.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Well that's the guy the 15 cause the funeral is giving deer up every day.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : That's up to you. That's up to you. You can choose. I can sign up the 15,000 for you, that's no worries. But what I wanna make sure you understand though, is whichever amount you choose, the cost that I'll work out for you today is designed not to change as, umm, as less. It gets older. OK?
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So in fact, the premiums are levels, so this means they're designed to stay the same year on year from now until Lester turns 85 years old.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Once less. Once Lester turns 85 years old, you won't have to pay for it anymore. The payments will stop altogether. Less is still covered after the age of 85, but I just don't have to pay for anything anymore. OK.
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK then. Yep.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And on top of this, as a reward for staying with us for so long at no extra cost to you, once Lester turns 85, he'll receive a bonus 25% cover. So this gets added on to the insurance amount as a thank you from us. So as an example there, if you went for $10,000 as a hypothetical, once less it turns 85, that 10,000 will then convert automatically to 12,500 for you there, Joanne, that's no extra cost to you.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Alright then.
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Alright, So if you did go for the 15,000, because that's the amount you'd mentioned to me earlier, umm, then that amount will convert automatically to $18,750 once less it turns, uh, 85 years old. OK, understand how that works?
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, yeah, Yep.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Very good. You can also find information about a premium instruction of website as well if you want to double check that yourself.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : You're not pretty sure of that on the websites?
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but finally, you're not sure how that works on the website.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm out.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, all good, no worries. Uh, but that'll be still available for you. But that's fine, no worries. Thanks for letting me know. I'm pretty old school as well myself.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I'm out of school, yes.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Now last thing to consider as well here Joanne, obviously when Lester turns 85, that's a long time away. He's only 63. It's over 20 years, anything can happen. So you have an option with this insurance and this is up to you guys. Of course it's voluntary, but at any time after Lester turns 85 years old, he can choose to end the insurance early and cash out. This means we will stop the policy and we'll pay you 75% of your funeral insurance benefit if you wanted to cash out of the insurance. But if you don't cash out of it, remember, as I explained earlier, you're not going to be paying for it anymore after less it turns 85 years old, the payments will stop and you also get the bonus 25% cover as well.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. So that's all pretty straightforward and clear. If you have no questions for me at the moment, we can go ahead and bring up some quotes for you.
[8 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So is that you mentioned earlier 15 is the amount you want me to sign of that, is that right?
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[8 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Let's have a look at the cost. I'll find it at the 15,000. If you feel that is affordable for you, great. If not, we can always bring it down a little bit, OK? Because I want to make sure it's suitable for you, Joanne.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : It's up to you, of course.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : No worries.
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So if you go for 15,000 in total for this insurance each fortnight, you're looking at one payment of $50.31 a fortnight, about $25 a week.
[8 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. Fortnightly, Yeah.
[8 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : They're roughly Yeah.
[8 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yes.
[8 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, 490, it's $50.31.
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Would that be comfortable and affordable for you?
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : GR Great. No worries. Now if you're gonna be paying for this for him, if you're setting this up, we'll actually give you back a refund next year. So once, uh, uh, once Lester has this policy with us for one year as a thank you for staying with us for that time following his first whole month anniversary, we'll actually refund you back 10% of all the payments you paid into this insurance. So based on that amount, Joanne, you'll get back from us next year a total refund of $130.82 just as a thank you for staying with us for a year. OK, awesome. Now also, do you know if let's has organized his will? Has he got one in place at the moment? No worries.
[9 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, yes, I'll try them yet.
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Well, we also include a brand new one for free with this insurance that gets posted out with this documents in the mail for you and umm, finally, keep this in mind yourself that Joanne is in the event that Lester was to pass away due to an accident. If that was accidental, we will pay three times the insurance so we'll triple it. So instead of getting 15,000, we'll actually end up paying out $45,000 if Lester was the pathway due to an accident. OK, perfect. So that is comfortable for you. And what we organize from here is we get Lester covered right away. All the documents will be posted out to you as well as sent to your e-mail address if you have an e-mail there. If not, we just post it out to your mailbox for you.
[9 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[10 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK, so does Lester live with you?
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : No, it is not far across the road.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Sure, sure, no worries. So what I'll do is I'll grab his address first and then if you like, I can organize, have the documents posted out to you. So I'll grab your address afterwards. OK, so starting with Lesters, what's the post code and suburb for Lester? Thank you. Uh, Gooduga. Gooduga. Yeah. What's the address?

[11 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : No worries. OK, perfect. No worries then, Joanne, thanks for confirming all those details. Now just to finalize this for you, a couple more things I needed to confirm with you. Umm, with this insurance, you may pay more in total premiums of the life of the policy than the benefit amount. And finally, please be aware that this insurance does not have the savings or investment elements. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you won't receive anything back. So I just need to make sure that you understand that. OK, Now if this is comfortable for you, what we do for you from here is we get lesser covered right away. So once we end this phone call today, lesser will be protected with the insurance.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yes, thank you.
[12 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : You're you're not required to make any payments today. Of course, the way we organize the payment for you is we let you choose a day in the future that's suitable for you when you like us to debit out the first payment from your account. Umm, and then, uh, this will allow you enough time to obviously receive the documents because everything will be posted to you. Hopefully by the end of the week they'll be posted from Sydney. They should arrive in e-mail. So once you've had a good read over the documents, if you, umm, if you're happy with the insurance, then the first payment will only come out of your account on the day that you've chosen in the future, Joanne, and it'll come out each fortnight on the same day you've chosen.
[12 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[12 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, But if you change your mind, that's fine as well. There's no cancellation fees. You can just give us a call back and apply to cancel the insurance altogether. You won't be penalized in any way.
[12 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So can I confirm with you firstly, are you authorized to purchase this policy on behalf of the insured letter?

[13 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I understand that Kim, I appreciate you, you letting me know that I'll just, I'll just need to reconfirm just a couple things there with you then for since you're going to be setting this up and paying for it, I need to just discuss a few things with you.

[14 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep.
[14 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So I'm sorry to repeat myself, but I'll just umm, I'll be quick for you. So once again, with this insurance for the first four months less that will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious surgery. Only after the first four months. It covers that for any calls. There's also the terminal illness benefit that's included. This means that after less is held the policy for 12 months if he was first diagnosed with the terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by medical practitioner, we'll pay the full insurance amount to you. You can use the money yourself however you like. Now, you could have chosen anywhere from 3000 up to 15,000. When I spoke to Joanne, she chose the maximum amount. Are you still happy with that $15,000 amount?
[15 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, thank you.
[15 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Sure, no worries. So that came to $50.31 a fortnight.
[15 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK.
[15 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : That is manageable for you.
[15 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[15 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Now a couple of things just to keep keep in mind is the premiums are level, so they're designed to stay the same as unless he gets older from now until he turns 85. And once he turns 85, you won't have to pay for anything anymore. Payments will stop and on top of that, you'll get a bonus 25% cover as well. You can also find information about our instructional website. And finally, once listed turns 85, he'll have an option to end the insurance and cash out 75% of his funeral insurance benefit. If you want to take advantage of that or not, it's your choice. OK, umm, you may pay more total premiums of the life of the policies than the benefit amount. And finally, can please be aware that this insurance does not have a savings or investment elements. If you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you won't receive anything back.
[16 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, yes.
[16 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So if that's all understood and you understand how it works and you're happy with it, can I please confirm, UMM, that you are the one that's authorized to purchase this policy on behalf of Lesser And are you happy to continue with everything?
