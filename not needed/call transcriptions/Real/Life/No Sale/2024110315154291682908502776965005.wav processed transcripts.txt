[4 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : That is why they produce like this, yeah.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Ah, thank you for confirming and I'll confirm Jacqueline is a female Australian residence. Yes or no? Beautiful. Thank you. So let's add her in as well. Has your wife Jacqueline had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : No, that's fine. Thank you uh, and for your wife, I'll just let you know how much cover you can choose for her. So uh, she minimum 3 minimum 100,000. You can choose uh up to the maximum for Jacqueline of let me just bring up the maximum for her because she's slightly younger, so her level of cover may differ to yours. So you can choose up to the 750,000 maximum for your wife. Did you also want me to quote you on $300,000 for her?
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, this, this code is different, yeah, between me and her all family, different code.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : No, it's the same. Same for the same insurance but she can choose more cover because of her age if that makes sense.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So you'll, you'll cut off cover is 500,000 maximum Hers is 750,000, but she's under the age of 50. Uh, so you would, would you also like me to quote you on the 300,000 for her for Jacqueline?
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, yeah. OK then.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, beautiful. Umm, now I also wanted to explain to you, uh, how this life insurance will be provided to how it works. So Joseph, our cover is designed to provide financial protection to your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you wish to pass away, if you were to pass away. So this could be helped, sorry. This could be used to help pay off if you have like mortgage or any loans, for example, or any other costs involved just in helping raise your family and protect them in case something happens to you.
[6 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, it's it's basically there. It's just it's there to give you the Peace of Mind that if something happened to you, then your family will have that financial security in place. So in saying that, you can nominate, so you can choose up to five beneficiaries that you would like for the money to go to if you pass away. So that's for them to receive the nominated benefit. Yeah, it's a beneficiary is the person you nominate to leave the money to. OK. OK. So I know you mentioned you've got four children and a wife, if you, for example. So if you wanted to leave it to all five of them, you're more than welcome. It's up to you. Otherwise, if you just say, wanted to leave it to your wife, you're more than welcome as well. It's entirely up to who you'd nominate. Umm, I also wanted to explain how how to apply for the life insurance. So please keep in mind, Joseph, not everyone is eligible for the life insurance. So what we need to do to determine if you are eligible is I'm just going to ask you some health and lifestyle questions over the phone and that will determine if you are approved for the life cover.
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I'll need to do that with you and your wife as well and also your children that are over the age of 17, uh, over the age of 18. Sorry, that wanna apply for life insurance as well to have a policy for themselves. Umm, otherwise the kids, the children that you wanna add on to your policy through the children's cover. I don't need to speak to them.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so in saying that Joseph, if you are accepted for the life insurance and once you decide to commence the policy, yes you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause. Just the only thing that is not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months there is that understandable so far? OK. Uh, the other thing I wanted to clarify with you is we also include a living benefit. So what that means there is a terminally ill advanced payment that we include in the cover for you and it's no extra cost. So it's included if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, then just as we will pay this benefit about to you in full this claim and you can use the money while you're still alive for anything, absolutely any means necessary. Is that understandable? OK. And any questions regarding that so far or is that pretty straightforward for you?
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is it? You're going to send what is called the clarification of this one. Then I can go through them with my my daughter.
[9 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course.
[9 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Oh, you can e-mail.
[9 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So I'll, I'll send you the quotes for you and your wife and also one for your daughter.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and then I'll also explain.
[10 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : I'm just explaining what you're covered with just so you understand how it works as well. Umm. So do you have any questions regarding what I've mentioned so far? Is that makes sense?
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. All good. Yeah.
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, all good. OK, One last thing I wanted to share with you that we include with the life insurance is a $10,000 advance payment as well. So this advance payment can help with the funeral costs at the time you unfortunately pass away.
[10 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So that's there for your beneficiaries to request at the time they apply to make a claim on your life insurance. So at least they have those funds available to go towards, you know, covering the funeral expenses in case something happens to you.
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, let's let's look at the pricing now because it is important that it's manageable and affordable for you.
[10 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. That's why I want.
[10 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So, yeah. So, uh, bear in mind how the premiums are generated, Joseph.
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : It is based on your age at the time of application, the level of cover you choose, your smoking status plays a role and also the gender that you are can depend on how much your premiums cost.
[11 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[11 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So for yourself, 1st $300,000 of cover per fortnight for you is $77.12 per fortnight. For your wife Jacqueline, for $300,000 of cover, it's $29.29 a fortnight.
[11 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Can you see the difference there between your and her sort of premiums?
[11 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : It's big different.
[11 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, OK, so I'll send this quote out and then I'll also, umm, confirm a quote for your daughter. So I'll just make sure I have the correct e-mail josephcanyou11423@gmail.com. Beautiful.
[12 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's my e-mail.
[12 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Now let's look at a quote for your daughter.
[12 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it's 23.
[12 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Uh, is she she the 23 year old you're wanting life insurance for 23? OK, beautiful. Let's confirm some pricing for her then. What's your daughter's first name to start with, please?
[12 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : It's Eva. Eva.
[12 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Joseph IVA, beautiful and same last name, Kenya.
[12 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, last 97.
[12 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : And what is Iva's date of birth please?
[12 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : He's 20/20/29 of August 2001.
[12 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : 29 of the 8th 2001, Yeah, sure. 29 August 2001 and I'll confirm either is a female Australian resident. Yes or no. It's beautiful. So she's 22 turning 23 in August, Correct?
[12 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, yeah.
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Let's add her to the quote. So I'll send this as a separate quote to the one I just sent for you and your wife. Uh, and I'll confirm as well. Uh, so you can send your daughter's a female Australian resident, correct? And has she had cigarette in the last 12 months? No, thank you. Uh, so for either based on her age, she, you can choose cover from 100,000 up to $1 million of cover for either. What amount would you like me to quote you for her?
[13 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, No, no, you can make between. Yeah, you can make even 200 is OK.
[13 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, $200,000 for Eva would be per fortnight $6.17 based on her age.
[13 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, OK.
[14 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I'll send that out for you. Joseph. I'm also wanting to take you through the application while I have you today so we can at least determine if you're actually eligible for the cover. So what I'll do before I can take you through the application, I need to save your address. Can I have your post code to begin with please?
[14 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK, post code is 6055.
[14 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful.
[14 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : It's cumbersome.
[14 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : And may I confirm what is your suburb Coversham? And may I have your address please?
[14 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 32 Lombardy. Lombardy Cumbersome.
[14 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So I'll confirm your residential and your postal address. 32 Lombardy Crescent, Coversham, WA 605 five, is that correct? Thank you. Umm, now just why I'm, while I'm loading up this application, I wanted to explain to you how the premiums work for this life insurance. Uh, so just keep in mind Joseph, that your premium, it is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age.
[14 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, yeah.
[15 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So in addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means that each year your son insured will increase by 5%. So the amount that you're covered with it will increase by 5% with the associated increases in premium. And, uh, if you choose to, you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year. You just need to apply to let us know, Uh, otherwise I'll give you an example just to help make sense of it. Uh, so as an indication, uh, for you, Joseph, if you make no changes to the policy, then next year your premium will be $91.69 per fortnight and your benefit amount will be $315,000 of cover for you. Is that understandable? That'll increase to $350,000 of cover.
[16 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, maybe quite lower because I got the mortgage also.
[16 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Uh, I wanted to ask as well, is that affordable for you the, the $300,000 of cover for $77.12 a fortnight or did you want me to quote you on something lower for you it but the mortgage?
[16 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. And then?
[16 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's look at a no, that's fine. It just as long as it's something that's affordable and manageable that we can find for you because that's also important as well. So let's say the 100,000 Joseph $100,000 of cover. So at least you've got something in place for yourself and your family would be $25.71 a fortnight. Is that more affordable for you?
[16 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that, that would be better. Yeah.
[17 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : That's better. OK, no problems. We'll, let's go through the application, umm, we'll determine your approval and you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well, but we will be sending all the documents via post for you to review also.
[17 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[17 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, wonderful. Just before I get into the application, Joseph, uh, is everything I've discussed so far understandable for you? It's making sense.
[17 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it makes sense. Yeah.
[17 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. So now the reason why we take you through the application, not only will it determine your approval, but it's also gonna confirm the final price based on the outcome of this application. I'll take you through now.
[17 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK then.
