In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year's or sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. You can opt out. It is automatic indexation each year. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be 72, sorry, $72.07 per fortnight. That's with your benefit amount increasing to $262,500 and you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well now. All right, sorry, that was on the $250,000.
