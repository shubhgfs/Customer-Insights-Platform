[1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : So I'll quote you on the 500,000 so that pricing is loading. Wanted to ask what, what inquiry? What sparked your inquiry in the 1st place, if you don't mind me asking?
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : That's right, yes. Well, you know, as you get when you're younger, you don't really sort of care too much about these things. And as I'm getting older, I'm having a few mates pass away here and there from, you know, at a young age and I've got two kids and and a wife that if something came on the sole provider.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Understandable. You're wanting that peace month for your children and your wife, and many condolences for the loss of your friends as well.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : So if something happens, at least I sort of taking care of them some, you know, some sort of way, you know, Yeah, pretty much yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So Oh my goodness. I see. I see. Well, thank you so much for your understand for sharing. Understandable why you're looking for that Peace of Mind then. So I will clarify. This cover is designed to provide that financial protection that you mentioned for your loved ones, which is through a lump sum payment.
[2 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : You know, 52 years old and all of a sudden he had got like cancer and stage 4 and, you know, plumber and, you know, worked hard his whole life and, you know, so and an uncle of mine, like at 7 years old, a bit older, but made me start thinking, yeah, Yep.
[3 minutes][Agent] : We'll provide it if you were to unfortunately pass away. So Rob, yes, you can nominate up to a maximum of five beneficiaries that you would like to receive the nominated benefit amounts.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : What? Yep.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : And in terms of applying this life insurance is very simple to apply for, very easy. You don't need to provide medical checks, you don't need to provide blood tests. All we do to determine your approval is I'll take you through some health and lifestyle questions over the phone. OK. In saying that, yeah.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : At the moment, I'm at the moment, I'm not going to lie to you, I'm actually ringing around and I've got a meeting with someone next week and I'm sort of shopping around at the moment.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : No, that's fine. You're more than welcome to shop around. That's that's great to hear.
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : I'm going to be honest with you.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Obviously wanna find what's most suitable for you.
[3 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So what we can do once we go through the quote is I'll take, I'll e-mail out the quotes to you with the information pack as well.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Alright.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : And what we can also do just to determine whether you're actually eligible or not is I'll run you through the application. We'll have you today as well. So if you are accepted rather than once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Just the only thing that is not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. But after but after 14 months it is. Oh, OK. Yep.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : In addition, after 30 months, it is in addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment also included in the cover for you at no extra cost.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So that's like a living benefit, which means if you were unfortunately diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then what we'll do is we'll actually pay the claim that you're the full benefit that you insured without in full to you while you're still alive, correct? Yeah, that's an option available. You don't have to utilize it if you don't want to, just there if need be. The other thing is that we do include a $10,000 advance payment, which can help with the funeral costs at the time as well.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So for example, all your wife needs to do is give us a call up to apply to make a claim when you unfortunately pass and she can request that advance payment at that time as well.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : That's really cool.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So she's got the funds.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep. So don't have to ask anyone to worry about it.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, she's got those funds readily available to cover your funeral while she's waiting for the rest of claimed process there, correct?
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's quite. Yeah.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I will. Any questions at all regarding that so far?
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : No. What about any sort of injury or anything that's not covered in this policy? No.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Is that pretty straightforward, The life insurance itself?
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : No, but we do have optional lectures you can choose to add on to your life insurance. So we have total and permanent disability, children's cover and serious illness cover. Did you want me to explain any of those optional covers to you?
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Maybe just injury cover.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So total permanent disability. OK, so let me just confirm. Do you work a minimum of 20 hours per week? Yes or no? Wonderful. And can I ask what your current occupation is?
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, electrician.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[6 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Self self-employed.
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Alrighty, thank you. So total permanent disability Robert pays a lump sum benefit in the event that you suffer the loss of limo sight or unable to work for a period of six consecutive months and they're not able to return to work in any field which you are experienced, educated or trained or if you would have suffered loss of independent existence. Umm, so in saying that, I will clarify there's an exclusion under this PPD cover for any intentional self-inflicted injury. And please, please also be aware that any payment that is made under the total and permanent disability cover, it actually reduces the available life insurance benefit amount to you. Does that make sense? OK, OK. For the TBD, then you can choose cover ranging from 50,000 up to 500,000. What benefit amount would you like me to quote you on for that one?
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Oh, wow. So let me get this right. If I have an injury and I've got life insurance as well and I make the injury on a permanent disability, then that lowers my life insurance payer, Is that right?
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Correct, yes.
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Is that what you said?
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So say you're covered, although when you say injury it's very vague.
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So it's going to meet the criteria of the PDS.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : It's so you'd be eligible for the TPD payout. But let's say you were covered with 100,000 TPD and 500,000 life. If you claim successfully on the TPD, you'll only have 400,000 life insurance remaining.
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : And, and, and to claim I've got to actually lose a limit, is that what you're saying?
[7 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Uh, so it's either, uh, you're, you suffer the loss of limbs or sight or you're unable to work for a period of six consecutive months and you're not able to return to work in any field which you are already experienced, educated and trained or if you would have suffer loss of independent existence.
[7 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : It's pretty long death, is that right?
[8 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So those are the criteria. Umm, did you have an idea around how much TBD cover you'd like me to quote you on?
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Oh, right, OK, let's say 100,000.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, so I'll start with the life insurance. It's a $500,000 of cover. Uh, that is $55.18 a fortnight based on your age at the Toms application. And then the 100,000 of TPD is $20.42 a fortnight. So in total, uh, it's $75.60 all together a fortnight. Are you happy for me to add that optional cover to your quote, The CPD?
[8 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yep, $55 yes. But if I don't get to go, Yep, Yep, just send it through.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, just for the quote purpose so I can send it to you to review.
[8 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : And yeah, like I said, I'm Yep, so make sure I'll compare.
[8 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : You don't have to take out TPD if you don't want to at the time you apply for life insurance because at any later date once you are approved if you take out the life cover you can actually apply to addon TPD.
[9 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : So explain to me one more thing. So every year that I get older, I'm going to be paying more for my, what do you call it, the premium, you know the monthly, is that right?
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : The premium, yeah, yeah. So just before I mention that, I'll just on the previous of what I mentioned at any time, yes, you can apply for the TPD option. Make sure it's just subject to eligibility at the time of application for the premiums.
[9 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Can you tell me how much 1%? Ten percent, 20%.
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yes, they will increase each year, so no percentage. I'll give you the premium projection itself. So from this month's, this year's premium to next year's premium. So your premium is stepped, Robert, which means it will generate generally increase each year as you age. So in addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means that each year your sum insured. So the amount that you're actually covered with will increase by 5% with the associated increases in premium. And you can opt out of this automatic index station each year if you choose to. Otherwise, just as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, then your premium next year per fortnight will be $87.95 and your benefit amount will actually increase to $525,000 of life cover and $105,000 of TPD cover.
[10 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : OK, so hang on.
[10 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : That's a fortnightly premium raise of about $12.35 a fortnight from this year to next year.
[10 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : That's that's for for both of them, you know, but that was for both.
[10 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : CPT Yeah, correct. Yeah, the increase, it'll be applied to both, correct?
[10 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : That was for a life and the disability like about $10 more. Yeah, OK. And that's step. And so let me get this right, if we go ahead with that And then also the amount of $500,000 raising, well probably like for inflation and stuff like that, Is that right? Is that what you're trying to say to me?
[11 minutes][Agent] : Yeah, it's, it's more called the automatic indexation. So it'll increase by 5%.
[11 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Although if you just want to leave it as is, like leave it at 500,000, you can let us know you want to opt out of the automatic indexation and keep it as is. You don't have to have the increase applied.
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : And and what would that do that would lower the premium? I'll take it.
[11 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Uh, the premium will still be set. So it'll still increase each year, just not as much as if you had the automatic indexation applied to your cover.
[11 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. And and OK, I've got one last question for you. Is this tax deductible for me? Yeah, yeah.
[11 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's something you can discuss in with in relation to with your financial advisor or accountant because we can't advise anything relation to that, but you're more than welcome to look into it when I provide you with a quote and have a review. All of it. Yeah, that's something I can't unfortunately discuss with you in relation to our life insurance.
[11 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that sounds good to me.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Thank you, Rob. I'll just make sure I've got the correct e-mail then rob.mark.maramara@hotmail.com.
[11 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : If you could send me out those quotations to my e-mail, you've been very helpful, correct?
[12 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll send the $500,000 quote with the little key fact sheet for you. It'll just summarize literally what I've explained with the cover.
[12 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Bear in mind as well, there is no expiry age or date. So once this policy is enforced, it will continue to cover you for as long as you live, as long as you keep paying your premiums. And it also provides worldwide coverage. So no matter where you are in the world, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, you'll be covered.
[12 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : And and there's no waiting time. If I get that today and something should happen tomorrow, I'm covered.
[12 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Correct, so that's only in relation to The only, uh, waiting period is that you're not covered for suicide in the 1st 13 months. Other than that, everything else will be covered definitely to any cause.
[12 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK, No worries.
[12 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Should I say, umm, what I can do as well? How about I quickly run you through the application so we can determine, uh, your eligibility as well?
