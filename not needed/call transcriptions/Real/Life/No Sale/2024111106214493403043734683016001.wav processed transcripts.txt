[3 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : jrmesebameseba@gmail.com. Beautiful. Thanks for that. Alrighty now, umm, I'll explain you how the cover works first, OK? It's very straightforward. Umm, so we take it to the questions to see if you're eligible, if you are accepted for the life insurance and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK, So if you take it out today, let's say tomorrow, possibly in a car accident or heart attack, for example, Touchwood, you're gonna be covered for those kind of things right away. OK?
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. Yeah.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Uh, now there's also a terminally ill advanced payment included as well. Say, hopefully you'll never have to use this.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : But what this means is that at any time you hold the policy, if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then obviously in this situation we will pay out 100% of the life insurance benefit amount to you while you alive.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm. OK.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, so they say you can use that money to treat the terminal illness or you know, pay off your debts, go on a holiday, it's up to you.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. Yeah.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Alrighty, now with the premium as well. You might know this already, but your premium is stepped which means it will generally increase. Each has the age.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : In addition, this policy has automatic indexation which means each of your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. However, you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year if you wish to. Each year you have that option.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll give you an example. As an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $137.19 a fortnight, but you benefit a man would have gone up to $210,000.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah, OK.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, so we'll let you know roughly 4 weeks prior to the policy anniversary date of what the new premium would be. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. OK Umm, do you have any questions around this at all? Mm, hmm. Mm hmm. Are they? Sorry, what was that? Are there other options where?
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, in case say after full price and your employment might be fees and are there other options where one will pay up TH the premiums will go down for someone to afford to pay?
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : MMM, no. So what you remember you have the option to apply to reduce the level of cover at any time. OK. And you can always apply to increase the level of cover at any time is all subject to eligibility.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, alright.
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Alrighty, umm, so I could say that I'll, I'll let you know what the $100,000 is as well. Just letting you know if you were a good look at the $100,000 cover, umm, that would start off at $56.77 a fortnight.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, goodnight.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK yeah. Now remember following your first policy anniversary day, we will also refund you 10% of the premiums you paid in that time for being a loyal customer.

From that day you do get a 30 day cooling off paid as well. Just in case you change your mind within that 30 days, we will refund any premiums you've paid unless the claim has been made.
[22 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK, OK, alright.
[22 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, now during this time we send out the full policy details by e-mail and mail.
[23 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[22 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : The only thing you need to do is fill out the beneficiaries form, sign that and send that back. That's where you nominate who the money goes to. But like I said, if you change your mind, you can apply to cancel the police at any time. There's no cancellation fees or hidden cost.
[23 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[23 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Does that sound fair to you? Mm hmm.
[23 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : You sound good. But my wife is in. I emailed very last month.
[23 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[23 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : So what is there if he's too in Zimbabwe, if I can appoint as a beneficiary, is it OK?
[23 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : You can still do that. That's 100% fine. They could be anywhere in the world. Yes.
[23 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, OK. I'll, I'll discuss.
[23 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, sorry. So you discuss with them and send all the paperwork back.

[23 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[23 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Then I'll I'll look at the option who will choose? Then I'll I'll fill all the forms and send back to you.
[23 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what I want to explain, you said there's no forms to fill, right? The only thing you need to fill out is the beneficiaries form. Does that make sense?
[24 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's that's the one I'm talking about. Yeah.
[24 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, so but to do but to fill out that form though it you know, you you can't fill out the form until the policies in place because does that make sense? So unless the policies in places you can't fill out the form and send it back because there's we haven't covered you yet.
[24 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK.
[24 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So what I'm, yeah, what I'm trying to explain, I, I'll just, I just wanna make sure you understood this right. And I just wanna make sure you, you have those two options.
[24 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[24 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : I can send that an e-mail first. OK with the pricing. That's one option, Sir. The second option is because you've been approved, we can send out the full policy documents.
[24 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
[24 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : You still have a chance to speak to your wife and, and whatever you need to do. OK.
[24 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[24 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : But yeah, we're covering you in the meantime. So for example, if you cover you for the $100,000, we could leave it at that amount. But remember, you can apply the increase or decrease the level of coverage any time subject to eligibility, but you choose the first payment. That's one of the reasons why we letting you choose the first payment date as well. Because this way you don't pay anything straight away. OK. They're the two options that you have. What do you wanna do? It's up to you.
[24 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, OK, Yeah, give me the first option then I'll, I'll, I'll do.
[25 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : The which option.
[25 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[25 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Sorry. OK, just send out an e-mail first.
[25 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : The first option, yeah.
[25 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, not a problem. So I'll send this out now. Umm, with the with the level of cover, which one were you more leaning towards?
[25 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, the the best you can afford is is the the I'll go for the 56 day fortnight.
[25 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : The $56.77 a Fort nine.
[25 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[25 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, that's fine. So what I'll do is I'll, I'll send that as a pre activation e-mail.
[25 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah.
[25 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what what that does is if you're happy with it, you can actually activate the policy on that e-mail itself.
