[53 seconds][Agent] : Hello. You're speaking with Taylor from Real Insurance. How are you?
[58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Good.
[59 seconds][Agent] : That's good. Look, I'll just let you know firstly that all our calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general in nature, may not be suitable to your situation. So basically my colleague Jasmine has explained the situation About what? What's going on, that you're wanting to set up a funeral cover for your partners. Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. He's gone through. He's, he's said he's umm oh. She's advised that he's had some surgery and he's lost his voice. Oh, Paul, is he doing OK?
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, he's fine.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Oh, well, that's good. Yeah. Look, I'm more than happy to organize that and arrange that with you. So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take down his details and I'll take you through the funeral cover and run through some pricing just so I can do that. We'll just start with your partner's name. What's their first name, please? Michael. And what's Michael's surname? So COUCHY. Yeah. Thank you. And what's Michael's date of birth?
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Michael COU, CH4 24950.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Is he also an Australian resident? Brilliant. Thank you. Yeah, Yeah, I think he's held held a policy with us previously too. So the address here, NI 19 Whiting St. Toluga, QLD 4680, is he still living there? Is that your mailing address too?
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK. Beautiful. Alright. No worries at all. So what what's made you interested to start looking into some funeral insurance cover there for Michael as well there?
[2 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : It was in a funeral plane, but it's all closed down. So I just it was in my real insurance follow.
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, of course. So what we'll do, we'll find something that's going to be suitable for you and then we can get the policy organized once we find something that's suitable.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : None.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So what we do is we get you to choose cover from $3000 up to $15,000. So whatever you end up insuring him for, that's the amount that the family receives when he passes away to then of course, look after what his final wishes are going to be. I'll just explain the waiting periods, umm, that we've got in place too. So for the 1st 12 months of the cover, Michael will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. And then after the first 12 months, it covers him for death. Use any calls thereafter. Now not only is he covered if he passes away, but there's a living benefit called a terminal illness benefit. Which means that after holding the policy for 12 months, if Michael was first diagnosed with the terminal illness with 12 months or less to leave by medical practitioner, whatever insured for it just gets paid out to him whilst he's still living. So if there's any medical bills or he wants to leave that money behind, let's say to you for example, that money can be used for however he needs to at that point in time. Now when he turns 85, so we there, we no longer charge anymore, he's still covered. And then we put a 25% bonus cover. All the other alternative is when he turns 85, there's something called an early cash option where he can choose to end the cover and we would pay 75% of the federal insurance benefit. Now the premiums are level, so they're not designed to go up as he gets older. They're designed to stay the same year on year. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website too. Do you have any questions, Sarah, that sounding straightforward so far for you?
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's all good.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK. What, what level of cover did you have in mind that you wanted to look at for him? From $3000 up to $15,000 cover there, Martha 15,000. Yeah, sure. Let's have a look. All right, so we'll go through 15,000. OK, Sorry, sorry. Taking a bit of time for ladies quotes. Umm. Now we triple the cover in the event of an accidental death to $45,000. So Michael's fortnightly premium, it's $50.31 every two weeks. Is that doable?
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be the payee.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : You're going to be the payee. Is that doable for you there, Martha? Yeah. All right, perfect. So what I'm going to do next is I'm going to grab your details now. So I'm just going by based on the policy that was set up previously. We've got your full name as Martha Jones dot. Date of birth is the 9th of February 1963. Yep beautiful. Now the contact number I have here is 0487122659 is that your best contact number? Yep beautiful. And then e-mail, I have is Martha, John. Sorry, Martha, j.63@hotmail.com.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Just a couple of questions I'm going to ask you as well. Because you're setting up the policy on behalf of your partner, can I please confirm you're authorized to purchase the policy on behalf of the insured? Yeah. Can I just confirm that you're authorized to purchase the policy on behalf of Michael? Yep, no worries. All right, beautiful. Now lastly, I'll just let you know that you may pay more in total premiums over the last of the policy than the benefit amount. Please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or an investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you're not received anything back unless you are eligible for and Michael chooses the early cash back offer. Thanks for listening there. So what I'll do for you today is I'll get Michael covered on that $15,000. That's $50.31 per fortnight. What we're going to do is we're going to distribute all the policy documents via post.
