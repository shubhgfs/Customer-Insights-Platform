[2 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep. I'll just have a thought about it. And I was just going to change it if that's OK.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Let's do that now then.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : I was just going to, Yep.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, for everything I can't call. Let's have a look.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : I was just going to do 500,000 for everything, so that's for the life. And then change it to 500,000 for the terminal illness and then 500,000 for the disability, if that makes sense.
[3 minutes][Agent] : We, we won't be able to do it for the serious illness, but we can do it for the TPD and the life cover.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Just keep in mind the way I explained it earlier because I know we went through everything.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : I've still got it all here with, with the serious illness. You can look between $50,000 up to 50% of your chosen life insurance benefit amount.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So the maximum I could do for the serious illness would be the 250,000 based on the $500,000 life aspect. Is that OK?
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : OK. Would you would? Yeah. Would you save it as it is? And that's fine.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, So change it back to 800,000 for life. Yeah. And then what did you want to do for the take a day?
[3 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep, just leave it. I'll just leave everything, so that's fine.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : I I did change. I think we're looking at $400,000 last time for TBD, is that right? Yeah.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And then the 250 for serious illness, 250 thousand. Yeah. So just to confirm you still understand everything I spoke to about each of each of these aspects of the covers and everything I asked you on the previous call, is that all still the same and no change?
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes][Agent] : Yeah, all good. So just to I'll repeat it out.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So a hundred $800,000 of life cover, $24.69 a fortnight, $400,000 of TPV cover on top of your life insurance premium is $10.93 a fortnight and 200 and fifty $250,000 of serious illness is $14.52 a fortnight on top of your life insurance premium.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So all together $50.14 a fortnight. Are you happy to S to apply for that those amounts? Yep, cool. Just to recap, remember what we need to try and do is get you through the health and masks all questionnaire so I can get through it within 5 to 6 minutes. It just depends on how you answer the questions. You can just tell me yes or no's the most to make it quick and easy.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : If you get stuck, tell me and then we'll just need your height of my Apart from that, everything else is yes or no's. Now things to be aware about is would like with the the questionnaire. Some people get declined so we can't offer cover at all. Some people get exclusions. An example of an exclusion might be someone might say skydive for a job right?
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Mm hmm.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So there might be excluded for doing that activity, but the rest of the cover they'll be covered if that makes sense.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Doesn't change your price for the exclusions. It just excludes you from, you know that S specific thing. Another thing that can pop up is loadings. A loading is not going to exclude you, but it will cost a little bit extra based on risk. So standard is really going OK, bit more of a risk for this. We're still willing to cover it though, it's just going to cost a bit extra. Does that make sense?
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So what we'll do is aim to get you approved. No change, but I'll stop and tell you if any of these things arise.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK? Again, if you get accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for debt due at any cost straight away.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And the only thing that won't be covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months as we already spoke about in the life aspect, there's the terminal legal advance payment benefit and the advance payout for T for funeral costs. So it's an advance payout of 10,000 $10,000 for funeral costs and the terminally ill advanced payment. Don't forget if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner that you call us yourself and make the claim so you can get paid out in full. Your life benefit what you've for, what you've chose. OK, again, your premium is steps, which means it will generally increase each year as your age.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : In addition, the policy does have automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will increase automatically by 5% of the associated increases in premium and you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year.
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Do you still recall going through that before we got off the call last time and I gave you the premium projection and everything. You still understand that?
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Cool. Again, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. I might just read you the, I know I already read it to you, but I'll just read you this last part. Back to the premium projection. So just to recap, as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premiums next year will be $50.14 a fortnight and your benefit amounts will remain the same as what we've spoken about. You'll get the free will kit in the post. So at $30, you can use that however you want, whether it's organising a new will or updating an existing one.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : You'll get the real reward back after the first four months. We did already go through that.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : I might give you the breakdown. So $64.20 for Life cover, $28.41 for TPD, $37.75 for seriously.
