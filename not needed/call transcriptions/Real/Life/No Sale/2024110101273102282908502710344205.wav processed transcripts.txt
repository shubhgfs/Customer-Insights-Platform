[2 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, fantastic. I'll certainly take it to it. Go through the options available to you and have you find a good solution and works well for you as well.
[2 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Thank, thank you.
[2 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, excellent. You're welcome. So my name is Alfred from Wheel Insurance. So Please note calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general nature. It may not be suitable to your situation. So just for compliance purposes, if I can get you to reconfirm to me your full name and date of birth there please.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : May 8th of the 11th at 12th August 83.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you. And can I also confirm that you are a female Australian residence? Is that right?
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic. Now your e-mail. Can I get to confirm your e-mail as well, please? Perfect. And what is the best contact number there for yourself? Perfect. And just your postal address.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah@gmail.com 0452092559 3064 Remember that? It's 20633064.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : That's the post code and your postal address, your your address and that is your postal address. That's where we mail out all the documents to. OK, perfect.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Now let's go now through the life insurance cover and potentially you're looking at coverage for both of you or is it just for yourself?
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Good. Just for, for, for me, it's Jonny, my husband.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Alright, OK. And you're both together.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, at the moment, I'm. I'm, I'm, I'm not the team. I'm on my way to get home.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, that, that's fine. Umm, the reason I'm asking because whether you take out a insurance cover that is for a joint cover or two single covers, it will make no difference to the premium anyway.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : But yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : It works out to be the same either way. So we can still look at you, uh, getting yours organized and then when your husband is available, we'll get his organized as well. No issues OK, Since it's not going to make any difference to bring him umm and each of you could have obviously a life insurance cover umm, and you can be policy owners as well.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK alright, so I'll take you to the cover first. So the life insurance cover that we offer, it does provide you with peace in mind that you do have financial protection. It is there for you and your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. And this could be used to help pay off a mortgage or loans, maintain their lifestyle or any other costs involved in raising a family. So basically it's that to give you Peace of Mind and if something happens to you, your family would have that financial security and you to nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amounts. So the process is an easy 1:00. So we just ask you some health and OP style questions over the phone to see if you are approved. If you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months. OK.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Also, in addition to that, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover. Now that means that if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, in that case we'll pay out your claim in full into your hands and the money could be used for medical costs to ensure you receive best care possible. So think of that as a living benefit tied in with the insurance also for your Peace of Mind, OK, We also include $10,000 that is paid out as an advance payments in to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. So as you can see, it's all together in one package for you in the life insurance cover.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Now, before we head towards some quotes for yourself, do you have any questions for me so far? OK, all right, all right, so then let's go through a quote together to begin with, have you had a cigarette last for once? OK, fantastic. Me too. Never in my life. That's amazing. All right, And that's going to certainly certainly help us here as certainly lower premiums as well. So let's look at, let's look at, umm, an amount that would cover your needs. I mean, the amounts you're looking for. Is this to cover anything specific for you? Like is it a mortgage? Is it just financial protection for you and your family? I mean, what, what's, what, what amounts you look kind of looking for and what, what does it cover for you?
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : At the moment they don't have a mortgage.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : They they offer our yes people. They they offer our house and that's basically like this for help and yes, like if they have any other experience or something, yes.
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Peace of Mind, I suppose. All right, so financial protection for you and your family. That's understandable. Umm, So look, looking at the amounts available here to cover yourselves, umm, you can choose an amount money to cover you from say 100,000 to $1,000,000 based on your current age. So what level of cover would you like me to quote you when I can begin anywhere so you can work out whether it's suitable first or not. And then we can go up or down depending on the budget as well, OK. Yeah, well, what amount? Sorry, What amount did you say for you to cover you? Yeah, Yeah, we could look at 1,000,000.
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : OK, yes, if I can see like if I can reach like the other one, one mail or yes.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So for instance, to cover you for $1 million, you alone, OK, umm, you would be paying. This is just you alone, OK? You'd be paying an amount of $47.67 a fortnight, which is $23.84 a week is what you're paying to cover you for $1,000,000. How does that sound to you so far?
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Much of it just, yeah, it's, it's more safe for me and I've been there.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So, so money without cover, right? You're not locked into the amount you're choosing. So you can choose a different amount and then so you're comfortable with the premiums. And then down the track, if you want to apply for more coverage, you can simply give us a call back and apply for more and it'd be subject to to your eligibility at that point in time. OK. But if you feel that this fits within your budget, $1,000,000 and you'd be paying $47.67 per fortnight, we can leave it at that for you. Or we can look at a different option if you like.
[9 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, because I so I kind of joined with my husband, so I didn't ask him, as I said, for that box. Or is it for myself or now?
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'll, I'll quote you. I'll quote you for both you and your husband. So you know what you'd be looking at first and then we can look at yours and then your husband's one later on when he's available. OK, so can I get you to confirm for me your husband's full name and date of birth there for him?
[9 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. June 55.
[9 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yes, Fantastic. And can I confirm that Sione is a male and an Australian residence, is that right?
[9 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I know. Mail is is fixed. Australia fixed. It's Australia fixed.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, is Australian citizen, so the male Australian citizen, is that right?
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yes. Yes.
[10 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : And OK, that's fine. So, and has he had a cigarette in the last four months?
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[10 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now I've just noticed something about him.
[10 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : He's currently 68 years of age, right?
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[10 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : For this particular life insurance cover, it's not available to him. OK, Which means there is another life insurance cover that is available to him, OK.
[10 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : But the range to cover him, the highest amount we could offer him would be at 100,000. Not more than that.
[10 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : 100,000.
[10 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, not not more than.
[10 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So they've anywhere between 10,000 and 100,000.
[10 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, yeah. If it's 100,000, yeah. How much for that one?
[10 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : All right, All right. So I bet, as I mentioned, I can't. I can't. It's not this particular life insurance cover that we could offer you. So to him, best we do is that it would have to be a separate policy. It can't be a joint cover, OK.
[11 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll get it. Yeah. So I'm, I'm, I'm going to be a a different line, but yeah. So probably A454 kids. It's how much it's it's $100.
[11 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : And, and yeah, it'll be a separate policy for him, but yeah, all right. It's because I'm in your profile and I kind of didn't do a joint quote there. I can't I've, I've got to go out of your profile and go into his one to give you a quote for him.
[11 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[11 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, so whi whi while I'm in your profile at the moment, umm, I just wanted to sort out this, this this part out first. Umm GI give me a second. Let me see if I can go back one step here just to give you an answer for him.
[11 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK, sorry.
[12 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. Umm, before I talk about your husband, umm, are you happy with your cover with $1 million cover or do you want to consider a lower amount than $1,000,000? Yeah.
[12 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Actually, I'm going to be putting a little bit lower because, yeah, because I I can't make the choice between. So I appreciate the rate a little bit lower.
[12 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : All right.
[12 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : It's going to be like 400 hundred.
[12 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : All right then. In that in that case, let's just look at what? Well, I've got you here on your profile, I'll just show you what it would look like if it was 500,000 for you, right?
[12 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[12 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : For you, it drops all the way down to an amount of $23.84 a fortnight instead.
[12 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm peppered by me. Please. Like me.
[12 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Alright, all right, so if you don't mind, let's proceed then with yours.
[13 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm the fifth.
[13 minutes][Agent] : Get that on the way first and then what we'll do is that I'll talk to you about your husband's one in a moment after we complete yours OK, because yeah, all right, no problem. So let's leave it at 500,000. No problem.
[13 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[13 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Couple things to keep in mind as well umm in regards to your premium, which is the amount that you pay your premium. These steps, which means it will generate increase each year as you age. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with certain increases in premium. You can opt out of this automatic indexation each year. OK, so as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be I'll just work this out for you. So, you know Marley, keep keeping in mind that all of our premium projections, they are indicative only and assume that you do not, uh, that you do not make any amendments to your cover.
[13 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So as an example, if you do not decline indexation on your policy, the premium payable in your following year of cover will be $27.22 a fortnight and your benefit amount would also have increased to $525,000 as well. OK. Yeah, the cover increases and your premiums increase accordingly as well.
[14 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So every year it has to increase the payment and increase the cover like what it's made, Yeah.
[14 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : If you're happy with half $1,000,000 and you want to just keep it at half $1,000,000, you can opt out of that indexation and then obviously your premiums will be lower. OK. So that's another option too. OK. You don't mind the increase? Yeah.
[14 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Umm, I'm, I'm wondering what's the one that's gonna be increased because, umm, it's yeah, yeah. I don't mind if it's sure.
[14 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : All right, that's fine.
[14 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[14 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Every year you're giving the opportunity to review your situation because we send you out a new policy schedule, generally one, one month prior to your policy anniversary dates. OK. And then you can opt out of that if you wish, or you can keep it going, uh, where you can, what, watch the sum insured increase along the years if you prefer, OK All right.
[15 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
[15 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Now you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well, by the way. OK, fantastic. So now the next step as I mentioned is to take you through the health not stock questions as the final price is determined on the outcome of these questions, which I'll take you through now.

So that was the, the umm, results of, of what happened in regards to the, uh, life insurance cover for yourself. OK.

We understand that BMI can obviously change along the years down the tracks. So you can obviously reapply down the track, umm, if that obviously changes, uh, but As for now that that became unsuccessful for yourself, but As for your husband, you can still take streams through a life insurance cover for you if you want to. It'll be a different one than this one, by the way, that he can apply for.

[21 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Oh, so all the answer I already answer or the question you asked me, Is there any other question I can go again?

[21 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[21 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : We weren't able to take you through what would became unsuccessful due to, as I mentioned, you due to BMI. Umm, when? So for you, if, if that changes down the track to BMI, which is a measurement between height and weight, umm, then you can apply, you can reapply for a life insurance cover with us.
[21 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[22 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Uh, but you've, you've already got a funeral cover in place for yourself. OK. Uh, so that's still active there for yourself. But what we can do, uh, for your husband is obviously take him through a life insurance cover available to him if you want to.
[22 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I am. I am alright.
[22 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what?
[22 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : So I still have to, if you can, half an hour or I'm still on my way. I'm still at home.
[22 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Uh, would he be there in half an hour?
[22 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : But yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll be here in half an hour. But yeah, I just want to see because I still have to speak to the Monfino or the.
[22 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Your husband, All right, umm, so either way, yeah, it needs to be, it needs to be, umm, it needs to be a single cover for your husband because the one that you just applied for, it was available at that time for you. Umm, we took you through that process. So that became unsuccessful, as you know. Umm, so you've still got that funeral cover for yourself in place. So you've got that level of cover, umm, for your husband. We can exercise and look at a life insurance cover available to him. This one isn't, uh, because of his age, it's 68. Umm. So therefore there is another term life insurance cover that is available now. What? What? What?
[23 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, you can call in half an hour and then verify this thing and maybe I'll I'll I'll come back again and call again to see if I can approve for the life insurance some other time.
[23 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's fine. That's that's totally fine. Umm, so I'll call back like you said in about half an hour while I've got you on the phone. I can take you through a quick fight for your husband, as I said to you at the beginning of the phone call, umm, to do that. So let's do that and then maybe by the time you get home, we can, uh, we can have a look at there for your husband.
[23 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, at the moment I'm, I'm still wake up for my, my work because I'm yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, yeah.
[24 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Now I'll just quickly go out of this section, go into another one. Let's find your husband's details on our system. What, what was his date of birth again, please?
[24 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : 5th of June 55 Yeah.
[24 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Did you say 5th of June, 5 of 6/6/19 65? Got it.
[24 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Fifth of the 6th 55, 55.
[24 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : And that was, uh, sorry, 5555, all right. And his name is Sioni.
[24 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's just look up the details. So this type of cover that it's available for your husband, it's known as a term life insurance cover. OK, so I'll explain to you how this cover works. So that way you've got an idea, I'll be taking your husband through it obviously again when you when you get home. But since you're asking about pricing, how much would cost him, I'll take you through that too.
[25 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[26 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, So I basically with the term life insurance cover, the way it works is it provides A and it will provide financial protection. It is obviously there for you and your loved ones to a lump sum payment. If he was to pass away during during the term of the policy, he can choose cover between 10,000 up to 100,000 and also nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominal benefit amounts. Now if that is due to an accident, his chosen benefit amount, we pay that as triple the amount. OK, so for instance, if you chose 100,000 and he does pass away due to an accident, then the payout would work out to be 300,000. OK.
[26 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So we can include, uh, we also include an advanced payout of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. So as you can see, uh, that, that benefit as well is in there too. So it is easy to apply for. The reason is, is that we just ask Seoni 7 yes or no questions related relating to his health over the phone to see if he's approved. And if he is accepted and once he commences the policy for the 1st 12 months, he will be covered for accidental death.
[27 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Only after the first 12 months he will be covered for death due to any 'cause as well. In addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in cover. That basically means that which means after holding his policy for 12 months, if he was, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness for 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner. In that case, we'll pay out his claim in full into his hands, money he could use for medical costs to insure he receives best care possible.
[28 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[28 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So that's a feature also part of the insurance or Peace of Mind for him. OK, this this cover all this policy will cover the only for a twenty term or until until his 85th birthday, whichever occurs first. At this time the life insurance benefit expires and premiums will see. So doesn't need to pay premiums anymore and his policy automatically converts to a final expenses benefit, which is 20% of his life insurance amount and covers he covers him for a further 10 years if you were to pass away at no additional cost to him. Final question. Now during this 10 years, he also has an option to cash out half the final expenses benefit and and his policy if he wishes. OK.
[28 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[28 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So while while we're speaking, do you have any questions for me so far about this cover?
[29 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, I, I am.
[29 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : All right, perfect.
[29 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I'm, I'm Yeah, yeah.
[29 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So basically for Cioni, keeping in mind that the cover does range from as low as 10,000 up to 100,000 and we can look at different amounts for him as well. So what?
[29 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[29 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : What benefit amounts would you like me to quote? You want to start off with how much cover?
[29 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I'm yeah, I just want the the highest one like the 100,001.
[29 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : 100,000 OK, look at that one there.
[29 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[29 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK so if he chooses the highest level 100,000 umm, the amount that you guys would be paying remember it will cover him not not only 400,000 but also accidental death would be pay up 300,000. So you'd be paying $189.50 that's a fortnight which works it'll be $94.75 a week.
[30 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : How much to are they? Sorry, a fortnight.
[30 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : That's how, that's how much you'd be paying for him $189.50 per fortnight for him for cover him for 100,000. OK or, or if you choose, for example, I'll just show you another a few options.
[30 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[30 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, if you choose 50,000 to cover, get him covered for an amount of 50,000, the premium will will go down to $94.75 a fortnight instead. OK, Another option, let's say if you go down to even 25,000, so let's say 25,000 instead, you would, you would be paying for him $47.38 a fortnight and that gets him covered for 25,000 any cause of death, but also 75,000 for accidental deaths. OK, but you could look at the other options too, because the increments they go up or down by 5000 that you can select from. So the next one down is 20,000, then you've got 15, then you've got 10,000.
[30 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : All right.
[31 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : I don't know. I'm I'm the biggest to see the highest one and all the all the amount that you say about all the different.
[31 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Are there any other announce you'd like to see you're happy with the highest level for Sione?
[31 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm happy with the highest level. And I just wanted to figure if it like this, I'd prefer to to go some other signal cover. So I I just have one single cover and then I'll pay for his for his life insurance.
[32 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So are you saying, are you saying that for your, for your, you have a single funeral cover for you? Umm, so you'll take him off the funeral cover and then you replace it with this one for him? Is that the idea?
[32 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes. We just have one single cover and then only and then I pay the insurance for him.
[32 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, yeah, yeah. That makes sense.
[32 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[32 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So, so you'll keep your funeral cover, you'll take him off the funeral cover. So you won't have a funeral cover. Instead, he'll replace it with this life insurance cover.
[32 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, So yeah, is it like this?
[32 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Is that right or, or you can keep or you can keep the funeral cover up to you.
[32 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : How how much my or how much for my? Is it myself for female color for myself?
[32 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Well, that's I don't have an answer for you about that one. But when we do, when we do get in contact with him, this is what we'll do.
[32 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK. Alright.
[33 minutes][Agent] : We'll, we'll go through the process with him get him approved first right get get his one sorted and then straight after that we can look into your one and then you can decide uh, if you want to yeah.
[33 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, thanks for that.
[33 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : How much is it to, to cancel him uh, take him off the cover and so forth.
[33 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sure, sure. Thank you. I'm I'm I'm I'm nearly home.
[33 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : All right, all right, OK, I can, I can, I can wait. I, I can wait. I can wait. That's fine.
[33 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : O or if it's up to you if you can wait or yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : If you're nearly home, then I might as well wait for you Uh, and then we can just have this completed then on the phone call now I forgot to mention as well couple couple more things on this cover too. First of all, what is applied on this cover for Sione is also the real reward. Now, the reward would mean you might have remembered this from last time with us following his first policy anniversary date. The first year that he signs up with us, we're going to also refund him 10% of what he paid during that whole year. So he gets 10% back as well.
[34 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[34 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's also part of the insurance. Umm, with this particular cover, his premium is steps, which means it will increase each year. Umm, but I'll take, I'll take you guys through an example when you're together, if you like, in regards to looking at umm, what the increases will be and umm, we can, we can go through that together as well.
[34 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep. I'll just stay inside.

So your wife and I were just having some discussions about some options for both of you. So considering you've got a funeral cover with us, cancelling that one and replacing it with the life insurance cover for yourself. OK, So I'm about to take you through the life insurance cover that is available for yourself. I'll explain that to you. We'll go through the options available and hope you find a good solution. It works for yourself as well. OK, now, now Johnny, what I'd like to do first of all is have you confirm to me your full name and date of birth here please.
[37 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yes. OK.
[37 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Thank you, Sione. And can I also confirm that you are a male Australian residence, is that right?

[37 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you for that. And your e-mail, can I get you to confirm to me your e-mail address for yourself?
[38 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : So we, we did the same e-mail.
[38 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yes, that's that's fine.
[38 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : This is yeah, we have one e-mail.
[38 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Just one e-mail. Yeah, that it's important that he answers all these questions. Umm. So if it's the one e-mail, if I can have you confirm the e-mail then for me, please see your name. Yep. OK, so it's a shared e-mail. Is it, is that your wife's e-mail or it's both of you?
[38 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's both of us.
[38 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, it's both of you. OK, All right, now if you can also confirm to me your address as well, please.
[38 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah #32 Walking Street, Quakeyden.
[38 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Postal address, thank you and that's in Victoria, I believe, of course.
[38 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Vic, 3064.
[38 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : All right and the date of birth there, oh the date of birth, sorry, the post code there as well is OK, thank you. OK, that's fine. And so now let's go through the life insurance cover together, explain that to you, and then we can hope you find a good solution. It does work. So with the term, it's a term life insurance cover. So you don't need it is available for yourself because you're currently 68 years of age. OK, so this cover is available to yourself. It's a term life insurance cover. And what it means to you is it provides financial protection for you and your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away during the term of the policy, you can choose cover between 10,000 up to 100,000. So that's the range and dominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the nominant benefit amounts. And if death is due to an accident, your chosen benefits will be paid out as triple the amounts, so three times the amounts. We also include an advanced payout of 20% of the benefit amount to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. So as you can see, it's together in one package for your Peace of Mind. OK.
[40 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[40 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So it's easy to apply for. The reason is, is that we only ask you 7 yes or no quest. Yes, S7, yes or no questions relating to your health. Over the phone to see if you are approved. If you are accepted and once you commence the policy for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death only. After the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any 'cause as well. In addition to that, there is a terminal terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover now, which means after, after holding your policy with us for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner. Well, in that case, we are to pay out your claim in full to help you with medical costs to ensure you receive best care possible. So that's a feature that is part of the insurance as well for your Peace of Mind as well as your need. OK, this policy will cover you for a 20 year term or until you're 85th birthday, whichever occurs first. At this time the life insurance benefit expires. Your premiums will cease, so you no longer need to be paying premiums anymore. Your policy also automatically converts to a final expenses benefit, which is 20% of your life insurance amount and covers you for a further 10 years if you were to pass away at no additional cost to you. During these ten years, you also have an option to cash out half of the final expenses benefit and end your policy if you so wish. OK, that's the only. Is it all making sense to you or do you have any questions for me so far? Any questions? No questions. All right, that's fine. So now let's go through a quote together then in that case, keeping in mind so only that we can look at different options. The range is from 10,000, that's the lowest demand, up to 100,000, the highest demand. And we can look at different amounts until we find right now we'll cover. So what benefit amount would you like me to quote you on? How much coverage were you thinking for yourself?
[42 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, 50,000.
[42 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, I was just sort of moving my headphone there so I can hear you better. What what amount did you say? Fi 50,000? Let's look at 50,000. Alright, that's fine. So if you look at 50,000 right to get yourself covered, the amount you'd be paying for 50,000 works out to be an amount of $94.75 a fortnight. That's for 50,000. Are you happy with that amount?
[42 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Oh, 50,000 or yeah yeah yeah would be alright. Would be happy instead.
[43 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : You're happy with that? OK, now a couple of things to keep note here as well. Your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. In addition, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be. So repeat that again, sorry. Your premium is stepped, which means you increase each year. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be keep in mind that all of our premium projections, they are indicative only. They assume that you do not make any amendments to your cover. So as an example, the premium payable in your following year of cover will be $96.64 a fortnight and your benefit amount will be $50,000, OK? And also remember that cover will expire after 20 years or when the life insured which is age 85, whichever occurs first. So just keep that in mind as well, OK?
[44 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. OK.
[44 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well, by the way, OK, per perfect. OK, So the next step, now I mention this to your wife as well. So following your first policy anniversary, that's your need, we're going to refund you 10% of what you paid during that whole year. So you get 10% back of what you've paid during that whole year. OK then fantastic.
[44 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, OK.
[45 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So what I'm going to do now, I'm going to read out to you a pre underwriting disclosure first. I'm going to grab your understanding. We're going to head towards some questions you and I and it's very important that you've answered these questions on your own record. You can't have help from your wife. So if the question is not clear, just ask me. I'm here to help you, but it's very important that you answer these questions on your own accord.
