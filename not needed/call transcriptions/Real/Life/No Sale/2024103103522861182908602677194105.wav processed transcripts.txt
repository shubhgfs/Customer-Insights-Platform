[58 seconds][Agent] : Did you have an amount you'd like me to start on?
[1 minutes][Customer] : Well, we when I did the online form, it was sort of sitting at the 500,000. I don't know how it'll work.
[1 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : If you'd like, I can start on the 500,000 in the middle. We can always work our way up and down based on price after I explain the cover.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : So if you can kind of give me a, Yeah, Yep.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Not too easy. Well, what about loads up? Of course in terms of what you'd be covered for for life insurance. So if you're accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you'll be covered immediately for deaths due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months. So that's the only waiting period you have to serve.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : And then in addition, there's a terminally ill advanced payment included as well, which I hope you never have to claim.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No, I hope not.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : But yeah, that just means that if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we're going to pay the life insurance out to you in full. So you get it while you're still alive to help with things like medical costs as well as planning for the future accordingly with your family.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : But Tara, I have got the quote loaded up for you to 500,000 now. But before I hop into that, was there any questions so far or sounding nice and straightforward?

[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. Cool.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : That's pretty good.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Today for 500,000 of cover tear, you'd be looking at an indicative payment of $15.43 per fortnight to, yeah, a little bit under $8 a week, of course, your premium. And with the life insurance, your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. And in addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year sum insurance will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. But of course, you cannot doubt this automatic indexation each year. So just as an indication on that though, if you make no change to the policy, the premium next year would be $16.20 a fortnight.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I mean, you're benefiting out all the clients to $525,000 and a of course you can also find information about our premium structure on our website that's paid for the $500,000 of cover to make sure your fam you're sort of financially secure.
