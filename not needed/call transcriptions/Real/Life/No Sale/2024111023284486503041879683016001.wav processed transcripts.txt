[2 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for calling. Real insurance. You're speaking with Amy. How can I help you?
[9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, hello. I'd like to for my partner, my Bab, my baby daddy. He's sick and got an e-mail. I would like to put some things for his tune on as soon as we pass on.
[26 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So you want to look at some funeral insurance for him?
[29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure, we can do that. I'll just grab some details. I am sorry to hear that He's not feeling too well, though. That's no good, so let's just have a look here now. I'll let you know. Our calls are recorded. Any advice are provided. Generally, nature may not be suitable to your situation. First, can I grab his name, surname, and William's date of birth?
[48 seconds][Customer] : William Matheson MITHESON, 21st of the 11th, 1973.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Let me just open this up. And what's your e-mail address or his e-mail address?
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Can I put my e-mail?
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Sure. How do you spell Christine? Yep. Yeah, so it's Christine. What was after that? Sorry. Yeah, yeah, at hotmail.com. Oh, Gmail. Sorry, I just cut it out. For a second there I thought it said Hotmail, gmail.com. OK. And what's your mobile number? Mm Hmm. OK, thank you. And William is a Nail Australian resident.
[1 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Christine Richardson, All lowercase CHRISTHRTCHRISTINE Richardson Richardson 059@gmail.com at Gmail 0475722411 Yes.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Perfect. So I'll explain how the cover works here, Christine, with our funeral insurance, the way that it's been designed is to provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to loved ones when you pass away. Now they can use the funds not only for funeral expenses, but also any other final expenses like unpaid bills, for example. Now, if death is due to an accident, that chosen benefit amount will trickle. Uh, it's very easy to apply. So there's no medical checks. If you're an Australian resident age between 40 and 79, acceptance is guaranteed.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Nope, Nope, Nope.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So if he was to suffer an accidental serious injury such as quadriplegic or paraplegic before the policy anniversary following his 75th birthday, the benefit amount would also triple.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : No.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Now just so you know, for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause. In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to leave by medical practitioner, we will pay your claim in full to help with things like medical expenses. Does that make sense?
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's completely makes sense.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yep, perfect. Now you can choose cover between 3000 up to 15,000. No, your premiums are designed to stay the same as you get older or as he gets older. When he reaches the age of 85, those premiums will cease, so you'll have nothing more to pay, but he'll continue to be covered and you will also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover that will be applied to the benefit amount. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website. And cover also provides an early cash out options. So anytime after he reaches 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover and we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. Well, that would be paid to him if if that was to happen. Now let's have a look at some pricing here. So bring this up. So between 3000 up to 15,000, what benefit amount would you like for me to select for him?
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no. Umm, how about 10,000?
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : 10,000, Sure. So for $10,000 cover, that would come to a fortnightly premium of $20.90, which equates to only $1.49 per day. How does that sound? Yeah.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, really good.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Would you like to look at any other levels of cover or you're happy with 10,000?
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : I'm happy with 10,000.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful, now there is a real reward. So following your first policy anniversary date, we will refund you 10% of the premiums that you've paid in that time. So you'll be getting back 5435 as a refund after the 12 month period. We do also provide a free online legal will which is valued at $160.00 with each policy.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK, mm.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, now have you understood everything so far, Christine?
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Hmm, yes I did.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Now you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. Please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you'll not receive anything back unless you're eligible for and choose the early cash back offer. What I'll do is I'll grab your address and we'll send the documentation there for you all to review. Now can I grab your post code and suburbs first, please? Yep. And stop that. Yep. And your street address there?
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Post code 4700 and the suburb is Ellenstone UMM unit 13154 Murray Street.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Murray St. Yeah. And that's your home and postal address.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. OK, So what we can do is get William immediately covered and I will send you all of the policy documents for you to review. This policy does give you a 30 day cooling off period to decide if the policy is suitable. So if you decide for any reason that it's not suitable, if you cancel within 30 days from your first payment, then you will receive a full refund of your premium. Unless the claim has been made. You're not required to make any payment today. So which is a collection day that suits you best. Now, can I please confirm you are authorized to purchase this policy on behalf of the insured?
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : My, I'm sorry, I didn't get that. I'm sorry.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : That's alright. So I can repeat that. So can I please confirm you are authorized to purchase this policy on behalf of the insured? Thank you. And are you happy to continue?
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So as mentioned, you don't need to pay anything today. So when would be the best collection day for you?
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : On the 15th.
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : That's perfectly fine. And is that a savings or check account for you, Christine? Savings and the name on the account, is it Christine Richardson?
[8 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Savings account, yes. Are you, how much will you be taking on?
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Christine, So that is $20.90 per fortnight and then the first collection would be on the 15th. Is that suitable for you?
