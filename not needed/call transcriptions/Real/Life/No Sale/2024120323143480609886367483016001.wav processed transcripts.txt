[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Is it the one you're on at the moment?
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : New number Yeah. 042 Yeah, sure.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So that's 04 double 208-0278. And at the moment there's no e-mail address, just the postal address. Is that OK?
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, yeah. That would be great.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : All right, So what I'll do is we'll GI I'll give you a run down on the policies first and then we'll go to how to, to have the name changed.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Thank you very much.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : That's OK, It's just loading them up now. OK, so I'm gonna start with the the life cover.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Now this is specifically an accidental death and serious injury policy. Now, these are serious injury and accidental death. Yeah. So with this, it covers yourself and Michael. Now these are individual benefit amounts that you're both covered for $155,134. Yep. And then 134.
[3 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : So the serious industry and Axel death, yeah, yeah, 155,000 yeah.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : I'm not allowed to round the figures off.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : So if what happens if I get if I get cancer or something like that?
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Now that's not something that's covered under this particular policy.
[3 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : So that's not covered.
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : That's where the the funeral insurance one comes in. But I'll go over that next because if I go over 2 policies at once I will confuse myself.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Alright now with this you're currently making a fortnight and payment of $34.36.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, now with the the policy itself, it covers you if you were to pass away due to an accident or if you were to suffer quadriplegia, paraplegia, hemiplegia, blindness, deafness, or total and permanent loss of use of two limbs as a direct result of an accident. Now the Accidental Death and Serious Injury policy does have an expiry date on it. Uh, it does end on the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday now because there's a, a slight difference in age. Uh, what happens is once the oldest person reaches 75, they're removed and the other person continues they're part of the policy until that policy anniversary after the 75th birthday. Now with the funeral insurance, uh, it works a little bit differently. Now with the funeral insurance, when you set it up, you would've been covered for accidental death only in the 1st 12 months. And then after the 12 months, it covers for death due to any cause. Now that does include illnesses as well. So things like cancer that is covered under the funeral cover.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yep, OK Yep, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Now that one you both covered for for 15,000 each.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : How much selling for this 8000 for funeral?
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Now that one that's right. Now with this, there's no restrictions on how the benefit amount is actually used.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Now you're currently paying a total of $69.01 per fortnight between the two of you.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : The place was Yep.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : That's right. Now let's have a look here because this one is the what we call the Flexi Plus. So it has a couple of things on there as well. So, uh, very similar to the accidental serious injury. This one also has an accidental serious injury benefit, but it's a little bit different.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : What's that one?
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So if you were to have a serious ACC, so this is on the funeral insurance, it's built into the cupboard or the accidental serious injury benefit.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So if you were to have a serious accidental injury before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday and something like quadriplegia or paraplegia, then we've had three times the benefit amount as a living benefit. So that would be a payment of 45,000 from the funeral cover.
[5 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK. So if something happens to us, we payout $45,000 on the funeral insurance.
[6 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : That's right.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yeah, OK.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So let's say you touch wood, but let's say you in an accident become paraplegic, you'd be able to follow the claim under press the funeral cover and the accidental death serious injury benefit.
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, now with this, uh, there's uh, an accidental death component. So you're due to an accident, you would have passed away then we've had three times the, the funeral insurance benefits. So they paid a total of 45,000 in that case. That's right. Then you guys had additional benefit that's paid out.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : So if I pass away from an accident, it'll be three times the three times that'll be 45,000.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : That's right, that's correct. Now if you have a look on a policy schedule, it'll normally save 30,000 because it's paid on top of the regular amount the three times.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, accident, things like that.
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Now one very important thing is that this funeral insurance comes with the payback guarantee, which means that the benefit amount that your loved ones received will always be the benefit amount you choose or all of the premiums you've paid for your funeral insurance, whichever is higher. So you really can't lose them, right? You keep your cover and make no changes to it.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So if you're covered for 15,000 and let's say for at the moment, you've paid $4164.82 for your part of the cover. So if you were to pass away from natural causes, we've had 15,000. But let's say you, you, you live another 10-15 years and you pay 21,000 into the policy, you pass away.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : OK. OK. That's good. So yeah, that, that's good.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : We've had the 21,000 instead of the 15 mm. Hmm.
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Now with the funeral insurance, a couple of things. Firstly, premiums on the funeral insurance never increase uh, every five years that you hold of this funeral insurance without making a change to your cover.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. Yeah.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : We lowered the cost by 5% every five years and the funeral insurance also has a early cash back option.
[8 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So at any time, uh, after you or your partner reach 85 years of age, uh, you may elect to end your cover and we'll pay you 150% of the funeral insurance benefit.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK. So if we reach 85, we can get, you know, if you know, we can request that before we die.
[8 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Alright, now I know every now that's correct.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So the idea is that you'd have it there if you want to get all your affairs in order ahead of time, Uh, but it's not a requirement that you do so if you wouldn't like to continue the policy instead, that's fine.
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Now I know I've gone through a fair amount of information in one go here, but did you have any questions about any of that?
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK, Now how do I add cancer to that? Yeah, I can't.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So the accidental death and serious injury, uh, you can't, uh, so that's right. So basically, uh, specific policies, we'll cover specific things. So there's the, the Standard Life insurance, which would cover death due to any cause except for suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Pardon.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : But so there's, so there's a Standard Life insurance policy that would cover you for death due to any cause except for suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : But it's not something that's added to an existing policy. It's his own separate type of cover, what you would generally do if you're wanting them.
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : So could I change it to that one?
[9 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's what I was about to go over. Do you have the opportunity or the option to to apply for the new policy? If it's successful and you put that one in place, you can decide whether you'd like to continue the accident without a serious injury or not. If not, you can have that one cancelled and let the life insurance take over. That's fine.
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, because I probably, I, I probably prefer to have the other one if I'm going to have insurance, right. Otherwise I'll probably going to cancel that one because yeah, it's not covering what I need it to cover.
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : I'm, can you, OK, well, what IC I understand. So what I can do is I can put you through to one of our sales team. They'll go through the, the actual application with you. If it's successful, then you can have the other one cancelled. Then we can, we can do that over the phone.
[9 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[9 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Uh, but that way if it is unsuccessful, you still have the other policy there.
[10 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : And also can can I have all of my funeral cover stuff information sent out to me please?
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : So then we've got it and we can read it and stuff.
[10 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So what I'll do, that's not a problem at all.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : That would be great.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So I'm going to send out a couple. I'm going to send out a couple of things now.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : The first is a what we call a policy schedule.
[10 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yeah, yeah, that's what we need.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So it shows the details of your specific cover or show you your benefit amounts, your premiums, who's covered that type of information.
[10 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yep.
[10 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : But if you'd like, I can also have a copy of your product disclosure statement sent out.
[10 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : That would be great too. Please.
[10 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : That's the, the nuts and bolts of how your policy works.
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Now, one thing to please keep in mind, uh, because this is a policy from 2020, uh, we don't actually stock the physical booklets at the moment. So because we'd be posting it out, it's just gonna be a print out of our digital version.
[10 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : No, that's fine.
[10 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : It's exactly the same information. It's not that fancy magazine style booklet. That's all.
[10 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : No, that's fine.
[10 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : All right. Now I'm just putting that.
[10 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : That's that's fine because I need to put it somewhere safe so my children know where it is.
[11 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yep, now with these as well, uh, it may come through as two separate letters because the, the policy schedule gets generated and sent out almost immediately the PO.
[11 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : No, that that's fine.
[11 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : So just keep an eye out for them.
[11 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[11 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : All right, now, before I put you through to someone to take you through that application, is there anything else you'd like to discuss on the the two current policies?
[11 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : No, no. Female cover sounds really good.
[11 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : All right, all right.
[11 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : I'm really happy with that.
[11 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK. So what I'll do is I'll get you through to one of our sales team to go through the application for the life cover.
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that would be good.
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : While I see who's available. I'll place you on a brief hold. Might take me a few minutes, probably as quick as I can.
[11 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, No worries.
[11 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : All right, please hold.
[11 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK. Thank you.
[15 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Thanks for your patience. I'm sorry for the delay, but I've got Jared on the line to this issue with that application.
[15 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, we'll be, but we'll be good.
[15 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Again, we've already confirmed all of these details.
[15 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : We'll get paid in 150,000.
