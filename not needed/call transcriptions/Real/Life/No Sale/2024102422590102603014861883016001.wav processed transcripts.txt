OK, There we go. Yes, so anywhere from $100,000 Amalia and you can get all the way up to it shows $300,000. So how much do you think you would need for yourself at this stage? Oh, sorry, 500. So from 100,000 up to 500,000, how much do you think you would like to leave for your three kids at this stage?
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK, So just only talk to the maximum of 500,000.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : 500,000 is the maximum amount that you can actually take out at this stage.

And then what I'll do is I'll let you know how the policy works and basically what the benefits are for you as well. Uh, and then if you need to look at any other amounts, please let us know because we wanna ensure that we're trying to help find something that, that you're comfortable with based on suitability and affordability as well. OK, now letting you know that money is that I specialize in real life and income protection insurance. So if you do have any questions along the way, just let me know and I can address that for you as well.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but with our life insurance, uh, Amalia, I can let you know that it does also include a $10,000 advance payment to help pay for like finals expenses as well. Uh, in addition, there's also a term ill advance payment for you. So what this means is that if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we would actually pay you the amount in full to yourself while you're still alive and living. OK, Yeah, to check your eligibility here, Amalia, you may recall that the last time you may have gone through health and lifestyle questions to see if you can get approved.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK. And this and that's what we do at the moment as well. What we do is we take you through those health and livestock questions and letting you know that if you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any calls noting that the only thing not covered is source light in the 1st 13 months.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, does all that make sense so far?
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. Now to wrap things up. I'll let you have the last few things here, Amalia. Then we'll go through the pricing options. So just give us a quick second. OK, so the last things to let you know there is that you may well be aware of this, that your premium is stepped, which means it would generally increase HEHEH. Umm. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. And of course, you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year. Now if you need to, uh, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. And what I'll do there, Amala, is I'm gonna let you know what the premium is for now and the following year as well for you, OK?
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Now, I can let you know there as well that given that you have our funeral insurance already, out of courtesy to yourself, Amalia letting you know that if you are replacing an existing policy, we recommend that you do not cancel until your application has been approved and you have reviewed this policy in as it might not be identical to your existing cover. And of course, noting that you should also consider the benefits that may not apply or waiting periods that may start again for you as well. OK, now Amalia for $500,000 being one for that. These prices are indicative subject to approval. That would work out for you at $156.98 per fortnight every two weeks there for you.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : And then it's basically that as an indication if you made changes to the policy of premium next year will be $188.41 per fortnight and then your level of cover would have also increased to $525,000 for you as well. OK. Now, would you like to look at a lower emit or do you feel that $500,000 would be suitable for you?
[7 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK, no, the 500,000 will be fine.
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, so let's take you through the application then. Amalia, I'm just having to get some notes here just from your previous applications just to see basically if there's anything that that that that we need to be aware of.

Umm, I'm just looking through the notes because it shows here that that one time in February of 2015, uh, I see that you took out the policy in March, but looks like that for whatever reason, uh, it got declined in February, maybe because you had something outstanding at the time, but there's no note in showing on the thing. So what I'll do is I'll take you through the application nonetheless, and then, OK, there we go. And then if it gets approved this time around, then we'll get yourself covered.

[18 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK, yes, I got because I broke my wrist, so I had surgery on my wrist.

[18 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So that was due to your your wrist joint in that regard.
[18 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep.

[18 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[18 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that's fine. That's on the list here anyway, So we don't need to get anything further.

Yes or no? Beautiful. So let me submit that here for yourself, Amalia. That'll come back within just about 1015 seconds. Letting us say if you've been approved and to see if there's been any advocate exclusions or if there's been any changes to anything as well.
[20 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : No, OK, yes.
[20 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, thank you. OK, here we go. So Molly, there's three things I need to let you know here. So first of all, the great news is that your application is approved. Umm, so you've been fully approved for the life insurance. The other great news is that there was no ad exclusions for you as well. The only other thing I do need to let you know is that I need to advise that the premium has risen and the reason for that, Amaia, is due to your type 2 diabetes. And the question about the diabetes in your application, the premium has changed, OK? So I'll let you know what that new premium is now, Amalia. And what we can then do is if you feel that it's still suitable, then great. But if it's not, then we can make adjustments to the level of cover so that we can ensure that we're finding something that you're still comfortable with based on suitability and affordability, of course.
[20 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[21 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now if you want to look at the $500,000 a month, which you still can do because you've been fully approved, that new premium works out for you at $334.67 per fortnight or what? Yeah, it's $334.67 due to the type 2 diabetes, uh, your disclosure on your application.
[21 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : 3 address, yeah.
[21 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : However, what we can do, Amalia, is so that if you wanted to, we can bring it back down to roughly where it was before and we can play around with the levels of cover so that we can still find something that you're still comfortable with. So would you like to look at any other amounts there at this stage?
[21 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please. Yeah. 250, fifty 300. Goodness me.
[21 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, I just, it's because of generally the risk that's involved with, you know, having type 2 diabetes. Look, I'm diabetic myself.
[22 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[22 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Uh, Amalia, umm, I've been diabetic for about 3-4 years and I know what you're saying, right? Umm, but I guess at the end of the day, it's more so, like I said, umm, those risk factors, I guess, you know, that's involved with, umm, having that type of condition. That's why there was that loading applied, uh, specifically for that type 2 diabetes.
[22 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[22 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, now what we can do that money is I'm just playing around with the prices for you.
[22 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[22 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Umm, if we were to bring it down to about the halfway mark, umm, at about just say 250,000, I'm just going to submit it here to see what that would come to.
[22 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[22 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : And then in the future, what I can let you know is that if you're in a position again to maybe look at more or less cover moving forward, the money subject to eligibility, then you can actually apply to increase or decrease accordingly in the future as well. OK. So if you need to so, but if you were to bring that down to about the halfway mark at the end of the day, it's you know, it's $250,000 for that piece of mind for your three kids there. Let me have a look here for you. Yes. And then that would reduce that premium down to $167.33 per Fort not for you.
[22 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, OK. How about if it if it goes on the 300,000?
[23 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Let me just resubmit it for 300,000 Amalia. And then if you're comfortable with that amount, then basically we're happy to do that for you. So let me just resubmit it for 300,000. Give us about 15 seconds here. I was going to ask somebody how come you haven't been back home for for a long time.
[23 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[23 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : It's not something that the interest you back going back to the Philippines or Oh, fair enough, fair enough. Yeah, sometimes, yeah, I used to always look for because my wife just got here two years ago from the Philippines, second marriage, umm because I'm, I'm separated and divorced from my first partner as well.
[23 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Because, you know, financially, you know, yeah, yeah.
[24 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and every time there.
[24 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : It's hard to go back on without money, you know?
[24 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I understand. Yeah. I used to always look for those strength fairs with specific, sometimes they had this like four, $5500 a return. Umm, and I always look for those because I was going back about 3 * a year before, you know, so, but you know, what do you do? So yeah, what I've done here is I've changed the amount for you to 300,000. So just give us one second. It's just reloading here now. OK, yes. So that one there works at just over $200 a fortnight. So it's $280 per fortnight for the 300,000 dollar amount. So would that amount be more suitable there for you?
[24 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Did you say 280?
[24 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : All right, $200.80.
[24 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[24 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that may be suitable and affordable for you.
[24 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, yeah.
[24 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. So what I'll then do for yourself, Amalia, to have yourself covered.
