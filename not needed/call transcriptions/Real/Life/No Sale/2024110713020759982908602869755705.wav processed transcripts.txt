[31 seconds][Agent] : So it's just the way on annual leave that, uh, today. So he just asked me to give you a call on his behalf to be able to go through that quote that you guys were discussing and, umm, yeah. If I can answer any further, uh, questions or if you want to look at the other pricing, we're hap happy to do that for you as well. But just because it is a new call today, Beverly, I'll just quickly remind you that our calls are recorded and any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. And Beverly, Clyde, just get you to confirm your first last name and date of birth for me.

[1 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and I believe you were awaiting for blood test results for, for.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that came back good.
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, cool. So you've got the results back from the blood test.
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK, cool. Now that's totally fine. So I'll just, uh, bring up the quote here that you guys were discussing now, uh, people, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, I have.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah And, uh, looking at the $100,000. So just letting you know because you, based off edge, you can choose anywhere from the $100,000 up to the $300,000. Umm, we, we happy to leave the quote at the $100,000 that you, you've already been discussing with them. Yeah, of course. So you quoted you a fortnightly premium of $94.68, uh, a fortnight. And yeah, if you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months.

[2 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : That why I'm not paying on doing that, Yes.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : That's just there for that extra piece of mind and umm, do you mostly give you the reassurance of knowing what you'll be covered for and simply what's not covered. So you have that Peace of Mind of, of mind. You know exactly what's covered and, and what's not. But umm, included in the cover, no extra cost. Beverly, there is what we refer to as a terminally ill advanced payment. So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we can pay out the life insurance to you in full and you can use to help use that to help with things like medical expenses, et cetera.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : And the beneficiaries of your policy also, Beverly, so they can request one advance payment of $10,000 just to out cover the funeral costs or any other final expenses at that time as well. So hopefully that's not a burden left for them to have to cover on their own.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sorry.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK. But is that all made sense so far, Beverly? Yep. And did you have any questions at this stage?
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yep, no.

But in addition, this policy has automatic indexation which means that each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. But you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year if you wish to. Now, as an indication, if you make no changes to the see uh for the $100,000 of cover, your premium next year will be $112.72 per fortnight and then your benefit amount is going to increase to $105,000.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
