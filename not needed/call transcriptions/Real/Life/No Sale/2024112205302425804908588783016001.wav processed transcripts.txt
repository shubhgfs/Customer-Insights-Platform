[2 seconds][Customer] : Hi.
[4 seconds][Agent] : Good afternoon, Shane, it's Emily calling back from Wheel Insurance. How you going?
[8 seconds][Customer] : Hey.
[10 seconds][Agent] : I'm good, thank you for asking. I'm giving you a call to follow up on the conversation we had regarding the life insurance to take you through some information and pricing. Just before we continue, I do need to let you know calls are recorded. Any advice you provide is general in nature, I mean suitable to your situation. And I'll get you to confirm your name and your date of birth for me.
[9 seconds][Customer] : How are you doing, Shine? That's how it's been in 1193.
[38 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. And I'll confirm you are of course a male Australian resident, is that right?
[43 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[44 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Thank you and happy for last week as well. By the way. Now, I did want to ask, what's actually made you interested in getting life insurance for yourself?
[58 seconds][Customer] : Setting, setting my kids up for worst case.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : What was that? Sorry.
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Well, I said, making sure like the family's looked after worst case, like if something else happened.
[1 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Beautiful. Just wanting that Peace of Mind that they're going to be taken care of financially. Yeah. Perfect. And when you say family, so do you have like a partner, children?
[1 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I've got both.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : What was that? Sorry.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : I've got both.
[1 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. Well, on this policy, you can actually nominate up to five beneficiaries, so you can specify who you actually want that money to go to and even how much you'd want each of them to receive. Now, I'll take you to our cover. I'll explain the benefits, how it all works, if you've got any questions. So jump in, let me know. I'll be happy to help you out. So with our life insurance, it is obviously designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. So this benefit can be used to help maintain their lifestyle, whether that is helping them pay off a mortgage or any loans or any other costs involved in raising a family. Now it's very easy for you to apply for the cover. We just ask you some lifestyle questions over the phone to see if you are approved. If you're accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months. Now in addition, there is a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover.
[2 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : None.
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we'll pay the claim out in full while you're alive. And that money can be used to help with things like your medical expenses. And you also have the Peace of Mind there's a funeral benefit. So your family can request an advance payout of $10,000 to help with the more immediate expenses like the funeral or any unpaid bills, while the rest of the claim's still being processed. And Shane, I'll also let you know your premium is obviously stepped, which means it will generally increase each year of your age. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in the premium. You can, however, opt out of this automatic indexation each year and you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. Now, just before we take you through pricing, have you got any questions or is that all pretty straightforward so far? Yeah, Beautiful. Well, let's take you through some pricing. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yeah, no problem. That was a yes. Is that correct?
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yes.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no problem. Me too. Don't worry. Now you can choose anywhere from $100,000 up to a maximum of $1 million. What amount would you like me to quote you on to start with?
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : The biggest, Yeah.
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : It's just a little hard to hear you. What was that? Sorry.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Oh, sorry. It's my daughter playing with a bloody iPad. Yeah.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK. The 1,000,000, yeah, beautiful.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : The the highest, Yeah.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : We can have a look at that to begin with. Either way, I'm still happy to go through it. As many quotes as you need. So you just tell me if you want to look at any other amounts.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So I'm, I'm just, yeah. Because I'm just trying to find out like what the maximum cover would cost. But yeah, at the moment I'm not committed to taking anything right now.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : But for sure, OK, that's OK.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : But yeah, I am, I am interested in finding out.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, no problem whatsoever. We can definitely have a look at some options. We'll take you through pricing either way. There's no obligation. It's entirely up to you whether you do want to take a policy or not. But we'll have a look at a quote for the $1 million to start because that's our maximum.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : I'm still happy to go through other quotes if need be, though. So you just let me know if you want to look at any lower amounts.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : But for $1 million of the life cover, including that terminally or benefit and the funeral advance payment, you'd be looking at a fortnightly premium of $93.07. That's for Fortnite. Does that sound like it would be affordable or would you like to look at some other options?
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK, well I've got a couple of things happening at the moment and once I know exactly what's going on then I'll be able to determine whether it's suitable or not.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Sure, that's no problem. I'm more than happy to give you some time to obviously consider it. Have a look at your circumstances as well. What we'll do though, I'll take you through some other options. At least you know if there's some other ones you can consider at the same time. If if for example, we were to look at 600,000 saying that would drop that fortnightly premium down to $55.84 per fortnight. How does that one sound? Does that one sound maybe a little bit more suitable or did you want to look at a third option?
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : To be quite honest, I obviously depending on what happens over the next couple of weeks, I would be more inclined for the higher one.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, sure.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : It's yeah, just just waiting to find out on a, on a couple of things with what's going to happen.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no problem. Well, we can absolutely leave it at that maximum amount for now and you can obviously reassess your circumstances. The next step either way from here though, because I know you mentioned you need a couple of weeks, which is fine. We can absolutely give that to you. We'll discuss all your options at the end. But the next step is to still take you through the health and lifestyle questions because this tells us obviously if you're eligible for this cover, but it's also going to tell us if that premium will increase or whether any exclusions will be added onto the see. So at least that way you know, you know whether you're whether we can't even consider you for this cover.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : If you're approved, then we can discuss all your options and where to go from there. Just before we go through these questions, I do need to confirm your address. What's your post code 6O36 beautiful and the channel suburb.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : 6036 Butler.
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Just stay with me and your address. Beautiful. That's 34 Tobermory Crescent. Is your postal address that same address?
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : 34 Tobermory Crescent Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, Beautiful. There's another thing I also want to do for you. It's a premium projection. So it's going to give you a bit of an idea of what next year's going to look like for yourself. Now, Shane, as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $104.08 per fortnight. And that's if you do not decline the indexation of the policy, meaning your level of cover would be $1,050,000. And another question I wanted to ask because I know you're obviously still very young, but have you got an up to date will in place for yourself?
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : No, not really.
[9 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : No, that's no problem at all. The reason why I ask is because we'll actually provide you with a free online legal will valued at $160.00 with the policy.
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So if you do want to organise a will, you can absolutely use that. It'll be emailed through and all the instructions will be there for you and we also have something called a real reward. So following your first policy anniversary day, we'll actually refund you 10% of the premiums you've paid in that time. So on this policy here, you'd be looking at getting $241.98 back from us after the first year.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Now to take you through these questions, I've got to reach you through something called a pre underwriting disclosure. Then we'll pull these questions up for you. So this reads. Please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes. We collect your personal information to provide insurance quotes, issue cover and other related services.

[10 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So with these questions, Shane, they're pretty straightforward. I can only accept a definite yes or no answer for most of them. And there's also a heightened late question in there for you as well. But they start off nice and easy. First questions in relation to COVID. So, have you been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the last six months? Or have you been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last seven days?

[13 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK. Was it, sorry, was it some sort of like sunspot or?
[13 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : No, they said it was AT cell lymphoma, but instead of being in my lymph nodes, it was in my skin. But it was only in one spot that got excised and it's yeah, completely gone.
[13 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK so was it a type of cancer?
[14 minutes][Customer] : Yep.
[14 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK so we'll put down a yes for you but there is drop down questions so shady. It says based on your response please answer yes or no for each of the following.

[15 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So it as a result of the fact that you have had that history of cancer within the last 10 years, once it hits over the 10 year mark, you are more than welcome to give us a call back to look at reapplying. Now you can ask the insurer to review this decision and if you're not happy with the outcome, you can request that we treat this as a complaint. Otherwise, we do have another type of life insurance. It's called a term life cover. I'm happy to take it through a quote for that. See if it is something that you'd be interested in. It's anywhere from 10,000 up to 100,000.
