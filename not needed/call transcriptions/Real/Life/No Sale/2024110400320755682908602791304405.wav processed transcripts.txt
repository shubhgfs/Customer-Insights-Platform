[25 seconds][Customer] : No, not a problem at all umm, the reason I was ringing back is because I went and got my clinical labs form from the GP because it says right well I'll go and get this done when I can't actually get it done.
[41 seconds][Agent] : I'm so, so sorry. It's cutting out a lot there. I barely understood you. What was that? Sorry.
[46 seconds][Customer] : Oh OK, let's see if I can move on. Although it's my landline so it shouldn't make a difference, but umm, the thyroid thing that we were talking about. So I went and got my thing from the doctor to take to the labs. I can't actually do this because she gave me on the 8th of July for just my regular review in three months.
[1 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yep, OK, Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : So if I take this to the labs, they won't do it because it's not, it's not a request for now, if you know what I mean.

[2 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, everything's still the same apart from this thyroid test thing.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So I just wanted to clarify. So if you take it to the lab, they're not actually going to allow you to do it because you've you have to wait the four, three months. So when would you have to go for it?
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : This, umm, lab thing is the 8th of July. So as I say, she just does a review every three months, a bit like diabetic, to make sure that you're on your right Med.

[2 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : July or September? October. Yeah.

[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : We won't be able to be honest, we won't be able to get you approved most likely today. The only reason being what's likely going to happen is we're going to have to send it off to our underwriters for further assessment. I'll explain a bit more of like what that means. It means that they can just assess you on like an individual basis and that way they can just decide whether they wanna wait until you have another one. But we'll also disclose like how many you've had that are normal and everything fantastic.
