Yes or no? No worries. Thank you. That's the end of the application. So thank you so much for your patience throughout the outcome.
[29 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[29 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So just in relation to the outcome, I will need to advise and reference the health and lifestyle application answers. We do actually need to refer your application to the underwriter for assessment.
[29 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[29 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So the reason is just in relation to your pericarditis, the other course that it's occurred and also the past three years medical advice you've provided.
[29 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK.
[30 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So that's why we need to refer send it off to the refer for underwriting. Before I send it off, I do want you to be aware as well as it is a life insurance, generally your premium is stepped which means it will generally each year as you age. So in addition, this policy has automatic indexation which means of each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. Although you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year before I provide you with a premium projection on that though, I do also need to advise that your premium also has risen. I'll let you know the reason why and then I'll let you know what it's risen to before we actually go ahead and send this off. So the premium has risen in the application and that's just due to your liver that you mentioned.
[30 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK, OK.
[30 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So the fatty liver, other due to health.
[31 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[30 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So the premium has risen to fortnightly for the $250,000 of Co cover for you. 3 min Sorry, risen to a premium of just let letting it generate that price rise before we refer it. So instead of $40.65 a fortnight for the $250,000 of cover, the premium's risen. 2 Just finished this for you, so sorry. Alrighty, let's have a look. So per fortnight, that was the amount you were inquiring for, wasn't it? 250,000, is that right?
[31 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yes, disagree.
[31 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yes. Perfect. So then the premium per fortnight has then risen to $60.97 a fortnight. So that's in relation to the loading that I mentioned was applied. So what we can do? Yeah. So in relation to the LO, to the leather.
[31 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : OK, yes, it's quite hard loading it is so even even if it's been cleared, I mean, even if so, even if it's been even if there's not a problem anymore. Ah, OK. So just because I had it, just because I I just because I had it in a post, even if I don't have it anymore, then it's a premium loading. I just want.
[32 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Correct, 'cause it's, it's the, it's your previous medical history in relation to the diagnosis of fatty liver, correct.
[32 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Is that what you're saying?
[32 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Just in relation to how our application process works, yes. So that's the outcome as of so far.
[32 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[32 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : But the application's not even complete yet 'cause we've got to get it sent off to the referrer underwriter for assessments.
[32 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, if you can maybe.
[32 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So I don't actually know whether you're approved or not.
[32 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yes. OK, OK, well, let's put it in. Yes.
[32 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So what I was going to say is before we refer it, I, what I, what I can do is collect your payment details and read you a declaration so that I can get this assessed by the underwriter. But I'll just confirm, are you happy to proceed with that first?
[32 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine. That's totally it.
[32 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what we do while your application is being assessed, firstly I want to make you aware that you will be covered for accidental deaths, which pays out if death was due to a direct result of an accident and then cover under this last until the insurer makes a decision on your application or 30 days from today, so whichever is earlier. And then what we do to get this sent off by the underwriters, we just let you choose a payment date of your choice.
[33 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[33 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So if you're fully approved with no changes, so if you're approved without any changes made, then the first payment will be deducted on that date, even though in line with the terms and conditions will cover you immediately from the date you decide to be covered. So what date would you prefer to have your first payment deducted if you're approved? Can you look up?
[33 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Oh, you can do it. It's a sports market, right?
[33 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it's up to you.
[33 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, so you can do it whenever. Whenever. Yeah, whenever. I mean, I don't know. I mean, whenever you can. I can't give you a date. I mean, I don't know how long you're going to take for the underwriters.
[33 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, correct.
[33 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : So like whenever you. Yeah. So whenever you're next. Next. OK, yeah, that's fine.
[33 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So if in the future you get to choose what, what date would you like the 15th?
[33 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : I mean, so I'd like the the 1st and 15th, yes, Yeah, that's fine.
[34 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we can do that. Ah, so if the underwriter approves, you'll cover without any changes made for $250,000. Life insurance for the pre premium is $60.97 to be first deducted on the 15th of March, Friday, every fortnight, Friday from there. And then I'll just quickly give you the the premium projection for your awareness. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, then your premium next year will be $71.31 a fortnight and your benefit now will increase to $262,500. Would cover for you there.
[34 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Alright then.
[34 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : OK, alrighty. And then what we'll do next. We just need to pop in your payment method so I can read out your verbal declaration to get this sent off to the underwriter. Did you want to set up a bank account or a credit card there, Gianluca?
