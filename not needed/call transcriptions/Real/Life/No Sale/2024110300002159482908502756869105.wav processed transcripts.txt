Now of course, in relation to the week bladder, I do need to refer your assessment to the underwriter for the application. The underwriter for the assessment, umm, but outside of that, nothing else has come up at this stage. So, umm, the, there's no change to the premium nor any additional exclusions.

So you have been fully appr uh, you may have been fully approved. We'll find out in the referral. Umm, but at this stage, there are no changes to the premium nor any changes and no additional exclusions. OK uh, so it remains at $48 per fortnight for $200,000 cover. And with the referral, what the steps are that we take from here, Diane, it's still this, umm, very similar to the usual, uh, we from here note down your preferred method of payment.

And we'll read you a declaration and then the referral will be sent off thereafter. And while your application is being assessed, you will be covered for accidental death, which pays out if death was due to a direct result of an accident. Uh, cover under this loss until the insurer makes a decision on your application or 30 days from today, whichever is earlier. And, umm, for reference, the commensity of your cover will be subject to final assessment by the insurer if the insurer does approve cover without any changes.
