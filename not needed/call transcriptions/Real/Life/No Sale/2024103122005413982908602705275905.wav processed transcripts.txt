[7 seconds][Customer] : Hello, Thanks.
[15 seconds][Agent] : That's good Georgina. The reason for my call is regards to your online enquiry a few days ago for life insurance. I'm just calling to go through that quote you requested and to answer questions that you might also have. Now, I do need to let you know that all calls are recorded and any advice I provide is general nature and may not be suitable to your situation. And I have your name here as Georgina Morgan. Your date of birth is the 7th of May 1973 and you are a female Australia resident.
[26 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yes, yes, yes.
[45 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for confirming your details with me there. Georgina, what made you look into life insurance?
[52 seconds][Customer] : Well, my husband recently got some and then he said should I get some as well? Because we had two more children when we married later in life.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Oh congratulations, fair enough.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, well, they're older now, but because we're both like early 50s and we have a 10 and a 14 year old, 13 year old, we're we're thinking, Oh my God, if something happens to us.
[1 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Oh OK, fair enough. So you're both looking out for the children with some the unexpected ex end up happening.
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, yeah.
[1 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Excellent, fair enough. Now that's what our life insurance is designed to do for you there Georgina. So it is designed to provide a lump sum payment to your beneficiaries. So in your case, you'll be your family. They use that lump sum payment however they see fit, whether if it's to pay for new mortgages, whether it's to pay for new loans, maintain their lifestyle or any other costs involved with raising a family. It's just there to give you the Peace of Mind. There is financial security in place, OK. Now when it comes to applying for it's very simple and easy. We do go through help and last our questions, but we do it with you over the phone, OK? And if you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death to any cause. The only thing you would be covered for is suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, OK.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : There's also a terminally ill advanced payment there, Georgina. So that means if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay the claim out to you in full while you're still living. That way you could get the best medical care possible or for you to spend time with your family but not come with the Georgia. You know, we hope you don't have to use that.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.

[3 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, that's OK.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : No worries. Now when it comes to the premium as well, it is a step premium. So that means it will generally increase each year as you age.

So that means each year your sum insured will automatically increase by 5% with associated increases in premium and you can opt out that automatic indexation each year.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm, right.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year, Georgina, will be $92.21 a fortnight, but your benefit amount will be $787,500, OK. And if you declined your indexation and you keep it at the 750, it will be $87.82 a fortnight.

Treatment can take the form of medication and or cancelling slash therapy. Example, if someone has mental health symptoms that require treatment, this is an episode. If they and if they return to the doctor several times to monitor the situation and also repeat prescriptions, this is the same single episode. If however they have a relapse or symptoms worsen and treatment needs to be changed or increased, then this constitutes a second episode.
