[1 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : What do you mean over and above? I don't understand. Yeah, But the other insurance might mind.
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Meaning if in the event you pass away, your beneficiaries can still apply the claim in your death on our policy with that mind if you have other insurances in place, as long as that, that, that, that that might be worthwhile for you to check with your insurance.

And, uh, to have the cover in place, it's a must need process to go through. You would need to go through any physical medicals or have a blood test, something like that.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, no, no worries.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : There's a Yep, there's only a health and lifestyle assessment that would take you through on the phone. So that's to assess the insurance, make sure you weren't durable.

[2 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Umm, if you are accepted and once you decide to commence your policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause. Yeah, uh, the only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK, damn it.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Well, hopefully not never right there. So, uh, but apart from that, the new negative policy can provide a piece of mind that full protection can be implied as soon as you start.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : No worries, buddy. All good.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : And for your, umm, benefit amount, you can apply between 100,000 all the way up to $750,000.
[2 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So how much would you like me to quote you on? Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months, Sir?
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So, Yep, the 7:50 I had not.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Thank you.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : I do not smoke.
[3 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful.

[3 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, you guys. My wife was talking to me.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'm sorry. Yep. So have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So to quote you about 750,000, if you're accepted with no further changes, it comes to $70, $0.16 per fortnight.
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : What's that, a month?
[3 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yep, I'll convert that monthly for you as well. So we just multiply that by 26 / 12 months. That would give you a monthly premium of 15201 per month.
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, a 152 a month?
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yep. 15201 per month, Yep. How's that sounding so far for suitability there Sir, price wise?
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : She's looking into it, mate. She she thinks currently I'm only paying $8080.
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Oh, so you're paying about half of that roughly.

[4 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK. And, and for how much coverage?
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : 500 So yeah, Yep.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, understand, because the, the way that our quotes are provided and calculate is based on, you know, your details at the time of application. So if you're starting off on a brand new policy, your age would pay one of the factors moving forward.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. No worries. All good. I've had that policy for quite some time.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : So the older you are, the, you know, uh, that that might explain the, the difference in, uh, of course.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, yeah, yeah. She's just having a quick look, but yeah, it, it, it sounds OK to me. It is what it is.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So, umm, premium, OK, I'm saying, and with that level of cover still be suitable for suitable for you to have as a further top up or do you want to adjust that amount?
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, what W what was that?
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Like would they would be level of cover at 750,000? Was that still a suitable level to offer you that top up or did you want to adjust it on the lower amount?
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No, in fact, I want a million. But yeah, that's what I was hoping for. But it it said the 750 time.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And I'll confirm that premium with you again, once your assessment is completed, that also checks your checks your eligibility. So with this policy as well, there is a terminally ill advanced payment benefit in the plan.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay you out your claim in full. That could be used towards medical expenses or it could also be used towards setting up family. That's up to you. If you do use it, get better from it, go into remission. We won't ask anything back either and also include with the policy is a funeral advance payout. So this is in built with the policy itself.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : In the event that you pass away the date your wife for example, she can request for $10,000 to be paid at first whilst the rest of the claim is being processed.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : This would all be in the document that you would send out anyway. That, that I would. Obviously you'd send a document out or something, wouldn't you? Or a policy, The policy. You'd send a policy out, wouldn't you? If I accepted it and all this is in all this is in the policy. Yeah, that's all right. Yeah, All good. Because I'd. I'd read it later on. So that's all.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yes, so yeah, so yeah, so like the full Pol most definitely this, Sir yes, so so thank you understand yes, thank you. So so once like, uh, so if the level of cover umm, the quote also benefits features is sounding suitable.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So, yeah, Yeah.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Uh, we'll go through the health and loss of assessment to check.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : So you don't have to sell me on it, mate. I'm moving forward. So let's do this.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, as as soon as it goes through the premium part, that is all that did. So I'll explain to how that component works.
