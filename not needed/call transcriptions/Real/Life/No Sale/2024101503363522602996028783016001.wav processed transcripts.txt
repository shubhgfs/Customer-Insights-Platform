[2 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : No, certainly. Yes. No, I can understand.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : And, and, and, uh, I'm not willing to take out a trauma 1 because it costs three or four times more than the life insurance because I know the life insurance is, is a reasonably inexpensive because, uh, I mean, my, my dad and my brothers and stuff like that are all in excess of 70 years of age.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Good to hear.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : And uh, I'm, I'm kind of the youngest and there's nothing wrong with me at the moment, but, but the fact remains that I would like her to be covered should I unfortunately run into something that causes me to fall over so.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yes, No, I can understand. I can understand that. Well, that's exactly what this cover is designed to do here, Steve. Uh, but I wanted to let you know, we do generally say that if you are replacing an existing policy, uh, we recommend that you do not cancel it until your application has been approved. Uh, and you have reviewed this policy in full as it may not be identical to your existing cover.

[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : We just generally say that when someone says that they've got another policy in place at the moment, regardless of where it is in the world, just to look.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : No, because that, that funny enough, that one, the life insurance I'm going to keep, I'm not getting rid of that.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, No, that's perfectly fine. Mm. Hmm.

[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yes, No, certainly.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : And, and I'm I don't see why I must waste money in the next six months for that.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : No, that's exactly right.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : And yes, something can happen, but I'm it's one of those things it's it's a dynamic that you have no control over.

[4 minutes][Agent] : It's gonna suit you best, Uh, perfect. Uh, and as well, umm, if you have any questions for me, please do stop me. I'll be happy to answer those questions for you. Uh, but essentially what our cover is designed to do here, Steve, is to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you want to pass away. So as I'm sure you are aware, this can be used to help them pay off any mortgages or loans, uh, maintain their lifestyle and any other cost involved in raising your family. OK, now with us, you can choose anywhere between one to five people to be your beneficiaries to receive that nominated benefit amounts.

Uh, but there is a terminally ill advance payment that's including the cover here as well. So what that does mean is if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we can then pay your benefit amount in full out to yourself to help out with any of those medical expenses. OK, now we do help out to the family that when you want to pass away as we also include a $10,000 advance payment to help in any funeral costs or any other final extension of time.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, Beautiful. Did you have any questions for me so far? No beautiful. Well, to to ease your mind in regards to what this policy does provide. This is a lifetime policy. So as long as you continue to pay the premiums, you will you'll be, you'll continue to be covered with us.

[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : OK, well at this stage, just to compare apples with apples, can you do it for 100,000?
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, certainly. Yep.
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : The reason, as I said, that's the cover that I have on the one in New Zealand and, and so so no, not the trauma, the life insurance. I've got a life in, I've got a life insurance policy and I've got a trauma.

[7 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : No call.
[7 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : No, of course, no, there's definitely something you can do. I do have a few other things I did want to mention to you there, Steve.

[8 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So your first 12 months, we are going to refund you 10% the premiums you have paid in that time. So you will receive $195.95 directly back into your pocket there.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Uh, now as well, we do provide you with a free online legal will that's valued at $160.00 with each policy. Uh, so did you have a will in place at the moment?

[8 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yep, yeah. Mm hmm.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : It's just a matter of matter of we didn't at the time we wrote it about six months ago, not six months, six years ago, we were changing.
[9 minutes][Agent] : Yep.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : There was changes in our lives that we wanted to just put something in place and we we did it then. But I'm more than willing to go with something that you guys can help us with.
[9 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : No, exactly. Well it is to another provider. They are called safe will and what they allow you to do is type up your will online. They then have their own legal team that looks over the whole thing for you and make sure it's all put in correctly.
[9 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[9 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : And once they approve it all they send it back to you to then print off & in front of two witnesses.
[9 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : And once that's then done, you have yourself at all.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK. No, that's good. That's good.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So we provided to you completely for free and they make it really easy for you to get all in place and as well organized because it's all online now, perfect. Now, if there was to be any changes that you needed to make within that first 12 months of creating that will as well that provided to you completely for free again as well for the 1st 12 months.
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : OK, no, that's good.
[9 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Oh, beautiful. Now the next thing I wanted to let you know of first, Dave, is that with this policy here, uh, your premium is steps, which means it will increase, uh, it would generally increase each year at your age, uh, but without with us. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation. So what that means is each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premiums. Uh, and you also have the option to opt out of that automatic indexation each year as well. So I'll jump into that and explain it for you. So as an indic.
[9 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK, 'cause I know, I understand that I've, I've got no problem with that. It's just WH what is the anticipated increase that that's the question that I'm gonna ask.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. Well, let me talk a bit to that one there.
[10 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah. OK.
[10 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy and you allow that to increase for the next year, your premium for the next year would be $91.50 per fortnight and your benefit amount has increased to $105,000, OK.
[10 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[10 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Now if you were to opt out of that for the next year, you can do so at every year and keep your benefit amount at 100,000. Your fortnightly increase would only go to $87.14.
[10 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK. No, that's true.
[10 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, so you do save this save quite a bit in regards to that, but uh, you do have the option to have a look at it in that, in that regard. If you wanted to increase it, you can. If you don't, you don't have to.
[11 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. No, that's good.
[11 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Now you can also find information about our premium structure on our website there. Uh, but Steve, I wanted to ask you, how is it all sounding so far? Mm Hmm.
[11 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : That's good. That's good. Look, I'm, I'm, I'm a very pragmatic person. I, I also think very logical and, and what I'm hearing is makes sense and, and there's no problem there.
[11 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yep, beautiful.
[11 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : So that's why, that is also why one of the reasons why I don't want to get rid of the one I have in New Zealand, because that one, that one is doing exactly what you are telling me now.
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, of course, beautiful.
[11 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : So, so that's why I say I'm familiar with what's happening and, and, but for me, it's not a, a pie in the sky, if you understand.
[11 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I get you, I get you.

[21 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[21 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : The first option is I can get some generic information about the policy and the quote out to you to read through with your partner and make sure it's gonna be right for you. Alternatively, what I can do is I can get that protection in place for you over the phone here today. That way you've got the pace and minds that is, if something was to happen, your partner there would have that financial protection, uh, now, but does it require you to make those payments today? And if you decided that the policy is not suitable for you within the 1st 30 days, we do provide you with that cooling off. There. So you can give us a call, cancel that policy and any premiums you have paid would then be refunded back to you. So umm, that's that is refunded back to you unless a claim has been made.
