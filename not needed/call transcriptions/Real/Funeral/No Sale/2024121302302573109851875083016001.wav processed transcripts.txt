[1 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : I want to cover my funeral and then have a little bit over. You know what I mean?
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Fair enough. Understandable. You know, it's good to hear that you're trying to get your ducks in a row and make sure that your bases are covered. That also gives your family that Peace of Mind as well.

[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. So what I'll do then is I'll explain it. I'll quickly run through the main features and benefits and run through take you through your options and run through some pricing with you.
[1 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm, yeah.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So The thing is life insurance is designed to do exactly that, provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you want to pass away before you birthday and when the policy ends. Now you can choose cover between $10,000 up to $200,000 and you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive the nominated benefit amount.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : How much like a fortnight would that be?
[2 minutes][Agent] : That kind of Before I can go in, let me have a look at that. What level of cover were you actually looking at, Vicky?
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : I don't know. It depends how much the cover costs.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Oh OK, fair enough.
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I just do it myself.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Oh well my question for you then Vicky is have you actually dis discussed or had a conversation with your family just surrounding your final wishes and regarding your OK?
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm on board.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Hey, that's OK. Have you possibly given it any thought as to what type of funeral that you were looking at?
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Not really.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK alright, well what I can do for you then Vicky, just so that you have AF better understanding, if you haven't given a thought as to whether you'd like a burial or cremation, I can take you through something because today just to help you and your family plan for this. Now, keep in mind, if any of the benefit amount is remaining, this can be used to support your loved ones in any other ways, for example, like unpaid bills.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Now, according to the government's Money Smart website, private funerals typically cost somewhere in the region of $4000 for a basic cremation up to $15,000 for a more detailed burial service.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Wow, there's a big difference, isn't it?
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Very, very big difference.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Wow.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So just in respect to that, Vicky, do you feel like what level of cover do you feel like would be suitable enough to cover your needs and to make sure that you know you have all your bases covered?
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Well, I didn't want to get cremated that day. Oh, hell yeah. I don't know what cover.
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Just to give you a fair idea about what you what you're looking at.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : I don't know what's best for me. Like I like to cover me funeral and have a couple of thousand over for them, you know, like, yeah.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yep, fair enough. So I can see here, previously you started, you enquired for a quote for $8000. Is that where you'd like me to start new today?
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a problem. I can definitely do that for you today. OK, let me just pull up my screen.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : So how much for the funeral?
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : For what level of cover exactly, Vicky?
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : How do I mean, yeah, for the funeral, yeah. But does it vary? How much is that?
[4 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : It depends on the actual nominated benefit amount that you wanted to opt for.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, so give me one second, I'll pull that up for you. So before I go into pricing, Vicky, I just want to confirm with you, there are a few things in regards to a cover that I do want to cover, just to make sure that you're aware of how our cover works and what's entailed in it.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Now to apply for the cover, it's actually really easy. We do just ask. Oh, sorry, one second. It is actually really easy to apply. So there are no medical checks and if you are an Australian resident aged between 40 and 79, which is yourself, acceptance is guaranteed. Just so you know, Vicky, if you were to suffer an accidental serious injury, for example, quadriplegia or paraplegia, before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, the benefit amount would triple. So for the 1st 12 months, Vicki, you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months, you'll be covered for death due to any cause included in the cover. Vicki, There's also a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding a policy for 12 months, if you're first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will actually pay your flight claim in full to help you with things like your medical expenses.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. Now, like I mentioned earlier, you can choose between $3000 up to $15,000. And a few things for you to know as well, Vicky, your premiums are designed to stay the same.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : How much is 15,000? How much is 15,000?
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So as you get, sorry, I can definitely quote you on that, Vicky. Let's have a look at that level of cover. OK, let me bring that up for you, Vicky. And that was fortnightly you were looking at.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect, won't be too long. Let's have a look at 15,000 there for you, Vicky. OK, so for $15,000 of Vicky, you are looking at a fortnightly premium of $94.06.
[6 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No, that's a bit too hard.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So I can definitely bring that down for you. Would you like me to look at? Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : The Oh, they have 50 or 60.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So, so the maximum amount, the maximum benefit amount that you can opt for is 15,000.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So that 15,000, that premium that I've just given you is for the $15,000 of cover.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Mm.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : I can definitely bring that down for you. And it comes down in increments of 500.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Hmm, alright.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So I can bring that down. Would you like to look at $10,000 of cover? Yes, I can definitely bring that down for you. That's a 10,000. So for $10,000 of cover, Vicky, we're looking at a fortnightly premium of $63.71.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that's, that's more like it.
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK, perfect. Now with in regards to what I was saying previously before I gave you that pricing, Vicki, our premiums are designed to stay the same. So as you get older, once you reach the age of 85, your premiums will stop.
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So you'll have nothing more to pay. And from that point, you'll have two options available to you. Now you can, you'll automatically receive a 25% bonus cover on top of your nominated benefit amount if you were to continue cover after the age of 85. The second option available to you, Vicky, is the early cash out option. So at any time after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover and we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website also there. Vicky, do you have any questions for me so far?
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No doubt.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. Pardon.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : I used to think that you it's not much good at taking it out when you're 85.
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, understandable.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Not much good at taking it out when you're 85 because, you know, you want it in there for the kids and my son. Yeah.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Understandable, Vicky. But as long as you like, you know, even like I mentioned earlier, it's a good idea that you've, you know, looked into this early just to make sure you're basically covered. Yeah, it's a good idea.
[8 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yes, exactly right.
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Now in terms of the $10,000 quotes that I've given you, I do also want to let you know they're Vicky, that you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. So please be aware Vicky that this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you'll no longer receive anything back unless you are eligible for and choose the early cash back offer.
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[9 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Alright, awesome. So what I can do for you today Vicky, is that you immediately covered over the phone today and I'll send you all the policy documents to review.
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Oh, great.
[9 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Now this policy gives you a 30 day cooling off. So if you decide that this policy is not suitable for you and you cancel within the 30 days, then you will receive a refund, a full refund of your premium unless the claim has been made.
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Oh, oh, no, I've been worried about this thing.
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Fair enough.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : People don't care, but I think they should care.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Fair enough. Vicky.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : You know, that's understandable as well. All right. Awesome there, Vicky. So would you like to proceed?

[9 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK. Awesome. SO11. Yeah.
