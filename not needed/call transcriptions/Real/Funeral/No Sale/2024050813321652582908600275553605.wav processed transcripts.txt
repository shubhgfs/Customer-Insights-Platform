Not only that, I'll provide you with the information just to ensure that you know you are completely understanding of our policy as well before you get into it.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Now, our cover is designed to provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to your loved ones when you pass away. They can use the funds not only for funeral expenses but also any other final expenses like unpaid bills. You can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive thi this benefit amount and if death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple. Now Linda, what that means is as an example here let's say you chose the $15,000 to be your chosen benefit amount. In the event where your death is due to an accident, that $15,000 will that $15,000 sorry, will triple to $45,000. Does that make sense?
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : If if what happened, what this situation happened? What what it will happen?

[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh. Yeah.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : And so in the event of an accidental death, so where your death is due to an accident, mm hmm. Obviously Touchwood there and I obviously no one hopes that will happen, but your chosen benefit will triple. So that $15,000 becomes $45,000 in that event, if that as an example that you if you chose the $15,000. Does that make sense? OK, so all makes sense there.
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, TH this, this more there. You start by the 15th.
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : No. So I was just using an example there. So yeah, I'll cover provides a cash benefit of up to $15,000.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : MM hmm. And so in addition, before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, if you were to suffer an accidental serious injuries such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit amount will also triple. Now it's easy to apply. There are no medical checks and acceptance is guaranteed if you're an Australian resident aged between 18 and 79. So Lambert, you do perfectly fall between that and so does your wife as well, as you mentioned earlier.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
