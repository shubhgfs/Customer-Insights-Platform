[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So what's made you interested in looking at some funeral cover for your brother today? Sure. Are you wanting to help him pay for this one as well or is he going to be paying for this himself?
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Oh, just looking up for him. No, I'm paying for it myself.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : No worries.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : You can definitely do that as the payee purchaser.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So that being said, you're able to take out anywhere from 3 to $15,000 in the funeral cover for him. How much do you think you'd be looking for?
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : How much is it, Sir?
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : $3000 is the minimum cover and up to $15,000 is the maximum cover you can take out. So this is the amount that is paid out if he passes away for you guys to cover the funeral cost. So how much would you like to have for him?
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Hmm, 15.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : The 15,000? No worries, I can give you some pricing on that.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah. I'll just need a pricing for the 15th for now.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Yeah, no worries. And I can let you know what some low levels of coverage if it's not going to be manageable on your budget. So we can play around with if you can until we find a nice balance of something that's affordable for you, but also the good enough now to have for him.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Umm, can I just also ask you, so when it comes to funeral cover thing, you've already got a cover with us for yourself, is that right? Yeah, no worries. So you should have an understanding of how this cover works, but just give you a quick refresher. So your first 12 months of cover, Fenika, he's going to be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months, he's going to be covered for death due to any cause at all. OK.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Now we also include a terminal illness benefit on the policy. So it means that if after the policy's been held for 12 months, if he is first diagnosed with a terminal illness, which is 12 months or less to live diagnosed by a medical practitioner, we pay the claim out in full while he's still living to help towards things like his medical expenses or even making Funeral arrangements in advance. OK, now the premiums are level, which means they're designed to stay the same price each year and not keep getting more expensive as he gets older. Now the amount that's paid out on his passing is going to be the amount you choose instead. If it's an accidental death, however, you will pay triple that benefit amount. So it's a $15,000 cover, yet 45,000 paid if it's an accidental death. OK, now we'll include all this for $32.29 per fortnight for him. So that's $15,000 coverage paid if you wish to pass away or in the event of terminal illness, or 45,000 if it's an accidental death. How does that sound? Is that an affordable and a suitable amount to you? Yeah, $32.29 a fortnight. Is that affordable?
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : MMM MMM OK MMM 5249 MMM umm, might go a little bit lower, like 10.
[6 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Of course. Yeah, definitely. How much would you want to spend on his by funeral insurance per fortnight, $2025 a fortnight? Yeah, yeah, Perfect. Well, if you did $10,000 cover, it's $21.53 a fortnight. Are you happy with $10,000 cover?
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : A fortnight, maybe 2025 dollars Fortnight around yeah round that price OK, yeah, that's yeah yeah, 10,000 is fine.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Great, no worries, let's organize that for him today so he'll be immediately covered over the phone from now and I'll send you through some policy documents to look at. You'll get an e-mail copyright away within about 20 minutes and a positive copy of the policy documents in about 5 days. Where should I be posting the policy documents to? Yeah, what's you? Umm, is it OK just to send it out to your address? OK, no worries. Does your brother live with you or received a different address?
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yes, ye, yes, uh, different.
[7 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, well I'll grab your home address first please. Yep. What's that?

[10 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. Alright, now keep in mind you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. Please also be aware that this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel the policy outside of the 30 day cooling off. The cover stops and you will not receive anything back unless you choose early cash back offer. That just means that if after the age of 85, you want to end this policy or he will send this policy, he can cash out at 75% of the funeral insurance benefit amount. Now we generally collected the first payment of the policy to TASI within the next 7 days. So what in the next 7 days? Would you like the first $21.53 to come out?
[11 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : In the next 7 days.
[11 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, generally within the next 7 days. Yeah, sure. Let's do that. So next Thursday, so that's going to be the 16th of March, is that right?
[11 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Next week, Thursday, yeah. Is that so? So this Wednesday or it's Wednesday? Yeah.
[11 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure, that's OK, we can do this Thursday pushed out that one extra day for you. It's not a big deal. And I'll, uh, grab your card or your BSP and account number for the payment.
[12 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : My BSB, I think.
[12 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. Let's do that. And it's just in your name. OK. It is a savings or check account. Thank you. OK. And I'm ready for the BSP in the account. I'm the one. You're ready. Oh, that's OK.
[12 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I'm just trying to find my BSB in an account, Sorry.
