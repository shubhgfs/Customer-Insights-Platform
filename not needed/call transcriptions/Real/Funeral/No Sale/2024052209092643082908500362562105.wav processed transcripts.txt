[4 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : And in addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will also increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. And you can opt out of this automatic indexation each year. So what I'll do is look into that for you. Now I did discuss with Rebecca that a few extras, you let me know if you want to add them on and how much you want them on 4 but we do have the total and permanent disability cover, children's cover, and serious illness.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Now with those umm, were you interested in having a look at those? MM Hmm yes, Yep.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : We're interested in the price, the I think it was for 50,000 for permanent disability and there's the other one that we're looking at 50,000 as well.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, so 50,000 for serious illness and TPD.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.

[5 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that is all good. What I'll do. I'm quite you on those. I'll also explain the covers to you as well.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Obviously it's going to be umm your cover, so I'll like let you know what they entail, umm, and take you through that. But focus on that serious illness just to give me umm. So you're looking at serious illness cover paid a lump sum benefit If you were to suffer an insured event covered under this policy. The funds can be used in any way you see fit to assist in any rehabilitation costs or an income replacement as you're recovering. Being short, events under this policy are heart attack, cancer, stroke or if you were to undergo heart bypass surgery. I'd assess against the definitions in the PDF, sorry. With that, look into that for you and you can apply for coverage anywhere from $50,000 up to 50% of your chosen life insurance benefit amount. But looking at that $50,000 for serious illness cover, it's $49.38 per month on top of your life insurance premium. Now looking at that as well, umm, I do need to let you know that there is an exclusion for any insured events that become apparent before or during the first three months of the serious illness option commencing will not be covered.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Umm, just like be aware that and please also be aware that any payment made under serious illness cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount. Sorry. If you also purchase total and permanent disability cover, the payday benefit amount will also reduce when you have a successful serious illness claim. Just so you know. But umm, for the serious illness, for the $50,000 covered there, are you happy for me to add this optional cover to your quote?
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. And I'm just going to take you through the total and permanent disability and then I'll update, umm, with the total premium. But with that, looking at TPD cover now, I do need to ask, do you work a minimum of 20 hours per week, yes or no?
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Perfect. And with that as well, can I ask what your current occupation is?
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Mine or I work out in gold mine. Mine operator.
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yep. So minor. Not a problem there. What I'm going to do is I'll double check this one. Umm, I know that I was speaking to Rebecca last time about this to get the pricing as well. Umm, So I'm just going to double check now. Perfect. Bear with me one moment. OK, Now with that as well, Shane, I just need to confirm. We've got a few here. Now we do have, do you work surface or underground? Yep, surface not a problem. And we've got here is it with explosives or with no explosives?
[8 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Surface open gap, Yeah. No, I I don't work on the explosive crew.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's OK. What I'll do, umm, get it down for you. So we've got service, no explosives and a minor perfect. I've got you down now. And with that as well. Just going to go back into that excellent. And without total and permanent disability, it'll pay a lump sum benefit in the event you suffer the loss of limb or sight or unable to work for a period of six consecutive months. And I'm not able to return to work in any field. But you're experienced, educated or trained or if you, you were to suffer a loss of independent existence. So that's what that CPD cover will include for you.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Right. And that's after the six months that I haven't worked. Is it?
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, it would be. So there's a few different things. I'm sorry, lump sum event. But if you stop the loss of a limb or side or unable to work for a period of six consecutive months and are not able to return, that would be part of it. That it would be 6 months just to begin with if it was any of those loss of sight or limb unable to work for a period of six consecutive months, that's when we can umm, start paying that out for you with a successful TPD claim.
[9 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : And there's an exclusion under this cover for any intentional self-inflicted injury. Sorry. Please also be aware that any payment made on the total and permanent disability cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount. And similar to before, if you also purchase serious illness cover, the serious illness benefit amount will also reduce when you have a successful TPD claim. But looking at that, you can choose from $50,000 up to 1,000,000 just depending on your age and your chosen life insurance benefit amount. So just to confirm, 50,000 for this one as well for TPA?
[9 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep, thank you.
[10 minutes][Agent] : Yep, perfect. Sorry, $50,000 of TPA insurance is $28.95 per month, and that's on top of your life insurance premium. So looking at the total premium, there was $50,000 of TPD, $50,000 of serious illness, and 200,000 of family last cover. It's a total, umm, premium of $135.82 per month there for you, Shane. And are you happy for me to add this optional cover to your quote for the TPD?
[10 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.

So I, the real rewards added together for you, umm, the total is $162.98 for the real reward that we're going to refund back to you after that first policy anniversary date. So go in there for you. Now, what I'm going to do for you now is take you through those health and lifestyle questions just to see if you're eligible for the cover and we can get you approved there.
