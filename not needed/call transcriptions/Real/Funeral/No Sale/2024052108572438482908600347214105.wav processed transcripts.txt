[3 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. Thank you so much. So Justin is mentioning that you had made some inquiries looking at coverage for your siblings and also your parents as well. Umm, was these inquiries look at the same policy that you have at the moment? I just want to confirm what sort of cover you're actually looking at for them.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : It's just funeral insurance. So it's it. It'd be just the same as like $10,000?
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. All right. So you want to look at cover for them for the same for $10,000 with the funeral cover, OK.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yes, but my enquiry was that do I have to get separate policies for each one or can I put them all under the one policy?
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So for your parents, Gary, they can be under the one cover.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : It's not for my parents.

[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Two siblings, auntie and a cousin? OK. In that case, Gary, they would all need their own individual covers.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : The only, yeah, the only case we can have, umm, a family policy is if it is a partner. So like someone in their partner. So a husband and a wife, you know, like it could also just be someone in their, in their spouse. They don't necessarily need to be married, but it would just be one person and their partner with family members. So in your case, siblings, cousins, aunties, they would all need to have their own individual covers. OK, so umm.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : OK, and So what was I gonna say now? I forgot. Yeah. OK, so H, how do I go about that? Do I? Can I get a quote?

So for Bradley, his one is going to be fortnight will be $17.32.
[9 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : $10,000 Yep, Yep. Hold on $17.32.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's right. That's for for Bradley. For Tom, his one is going to be $12.68. And then for Rosemary, her one is going to be $33.54.
[10 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep, $33.54.
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right.
[10 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Can I put them policies in place?
[10 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course you can definitely do that.
[11 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes][Agent] : So we'll just need to go through them individually and then we can get all organised. OK, well bear with me for just a moment. And were you able to find Elsie's date of birth by transfer, Kerry?
[11 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Hold on, it's February 3rd of February 1998. Yeah, it's the 3rd of February 1998.
[12 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : 3rd of February 1998. Third of Feb 1998. OK, let's put that into the system. One SEC. And you said her else you sent him is Besta Smith as well. Just Smith. OK, sorry, just Smith. All right, so let me get a quote for her too, and what amount of coverage you want to look at for her.
[12 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : No, Smith the same.
[13 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Same amount. OK? All right, so for 10 grand for Elsie, her premium every fortnight, it's going to work out to be $10.82.
[13 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[13 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK. So I'll just add it all up together for you so that you know what the title is.
[13 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I've got the total.
[13 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, 1082 + 1732 + 1268 + 3354 totaling to for all those four members that you've mentioned, the total is $74.36 per fortnight. Would that would that be manageable? OK, So I'll just want to cover the benefits in terms of the policy as well with you just before we set it up. Umm, with the funeral insurance, it is guaranteed acceptance. So no medicals are needed of any kind. That's why you can do it for them. Umm, now everything I explained, now all the benefits, this is gonna apply to everybody. So it's the same set of benefits and features to everybody because it's the same policy for everyone.
[14 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[14 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : They're just, the only thing is they're gonna be under their own individual covers. So just in regards to the benefits that's included and the terms, the first thing would be once we cover them, they will be insured straight away. But for the 1st 12 months to cover, we will insure them for an for an accidental death and an accidental serious injury only. And then after the first 12 months, they'll then be covered for death due to any cause. OK, so again, once insured for the 1st 12 months of the policy, they'll be covered for an accidental death and an accidental serious injury only, and then after the first 12 months they will then be covered for death due to any cause. If they do pass away in an accident though, we would then pay out triple what they're covered for. So just as an example, if they've got covered for the 10 grand, if they pass in an accident, we then pay out 30,000.
[15 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[15 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : In addition to this, there's a terminal illness benefit which is included as part of the cover. What this means is that after holding the policy for 12 months, if they were diag, if they were first diagnosed with the terminal illness, so it's 12 months or less to live. And if that is by a medical practitioner, then whatever amount of money that they're covered for, we just pay them out that entire thing whilst they're still living so they can use the money however they want to.
[15 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[15 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : And then with their policies, the each person will cover them all the way until they reach 100 years of age. But you would, they would. Oh, if you're paying for it, this obviously applies to you. You would only need to pay for the cover until they reach the age of 85. So obviously you're onto being the eldest. As soon as she reaches the age of 85, you stop paying for her. And then same thing respectively for each person. Once each person reaches 85 years of age, you stop paying completely. But we do cover each person up until they reach 100 years of age. Does that make sense?
[16 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[16 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Great. And with your premium, Sir, this applies to everybody. Your premium is a level premium and you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amounts. OK. Now those are the main benefits included there. Just in terms of how the cover works for everyone's policy, there is a cooling off. As well, right, that they've got. But what I'm going to, what I'm going to say now here, Gary applies to everybody's cover that you're setting this up for. Just please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you do cancel and it's outside of the 30 days of the cooling off. Then your cover will stop and you'll not receive anything back afterwards. OK, OK. And the last thing that I wanted to mention is there is an option built into the cover where when each person reaches the age of 85, there is an option that they get. So this is something that they can use if they want to, where what they can do is they may elect to end their policy and they can cash out of it 75% of what they were insured for, right. So that's only that's something they can use if they want to. If they, if they choose not to, you know, obviously they don't need to worry about it, but it's an option that each person is going to get when they reach when they reach the age of 85. So they can use it at that point or any time after. That's called the only cash out option. And it's only something that they can use should they decide that they went through.
[16 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[17 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, does all that make sense?
[17 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[17 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, easy. So I'll just start off with we can start up with Rose. I've got her at the top of my list here, so we'll set it up for her first. Make sure the process here that I'll let you know of in regards to how we set it up. I'll just get the account details. We'll choose a payment date. I'll then read out the declaration, dirty declaration just takes about two minutes or so, and we'll just repeat that process for everybody. So that's why I just wanted to explain the cover first because it's just going to be the same. The cover is the same for everybody. So that way we don't have to, I don't have to explain it to you again. Uh, but you've understood everything I've explained in regards to how the cover works and all the benefits and features and everything.
[17 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[18 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. All right, bear with me for just one moment. I'm just going to get Rose's policy over my screen first. Should just take me about two minutes to get this up.
[18 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : So see how I have a policy with you. Can I use that credit card details or do I need to give all that details to you again?
[18 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'll need to grab your details again, Gary, because your details are encrypted into the system through security.
[18 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[18 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Once it's in the system, we can't see it anymore. So for security reasons, we ask you to provide it every time.
[18 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's fine.
[18 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And for for Rosemary Vista, can I please confirm that she's an Australian resident and female? OK, thank you.

[21 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK. And I'll just confirm your address, please.

[21 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[21 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK. All right, and just to confirm again for each person, you can choose anywhere from 3000 up to 15,000, but you again you want 10,000 for each person just to confirm. OK, sure.
