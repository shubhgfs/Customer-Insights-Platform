[59 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[59 seconds][Agent] : And happy to help you do this if you end up like in the past. We'll get you covered. We'll get your mum, mother-in-law covered. Of course.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Now, just to begin with, please be aware the call is recorded. The advice I provide general nature, it may not be suitable for your situation.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Can I confirm that that is Doris Haywood we're talking about today?
[1 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And her date of thank you. And her date of birth is 25th of the 4th, 1950.

[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And can I confirm she is a female Australian resident?
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, please.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : There we go. So we've just finished our checks. Acceptance is guaranteed for any Australian resident, 18 to 79. So your mother-in-law is definitely within the right ranges that if you like the coverage, we can get it covered. Now I want to be able to get to the information out. Do you have a valid e-mail you'd maybe like me to e-mail off documentation to? Yeah.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, yeah, my yes. It's Gabrielle, 74, nemonrdoublemo@gmail.com.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : At gmail.com now. I just wanted to check with Gabrielle. Could you spell that to make sure I've done it correctly? Good. Yep. Yep, Excellent. Look at me. I can spell this morning, say thank you very much.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, it's Gabriel GABRI EL74 Limo NI doublemo@gmail.com Yep.
[2 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : We've definitely got that in there now, just to confirm, there. Good boy. Does Doriso already have some coverage out there? Is this the first time looking into these sort of things?
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm not. It's she hasn't got no coverage. We couldn't talk to her about anything like that. It's just sort of recently that I'm because I'm pretty sure I'm a straight shooter.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : So I had her over here for dinner and we found out that she's got no coverage, no nothing.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : And she's one of those ladies that she thinks she's 70 and she's gonna live till she's 170, and that's not the case.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Look, there's there's always a part when I go through these. I do kind of hope you guys live long and healthy lives.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I know it will.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : You know, we've got features right up until the day before you're 100, which I'm gonna of course, go through there with you. But I do understand, you know, having a bit of Peace of Mind knowing if something did happen, we'd be there to potentially help that I understand your thinking here. And hopefully that's exactly what I'm gonna be offering you today is a bit of Peace of Mind knowing that when Doris Pastor was away, we're gonna provide up to $15,000 as a cash benefit to a loved one there. Actually, while we're speaking about the cash benefit, we can do 3 to 15. Did you actually have a figure in mind already?
[3 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was looking at because we got the maximum for my wife.
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : So if then she goes, she'll have a good send off. But I don't know. I'm not, I don't know what we, my options are with, with my mother law because at her age and she has been diagnosed emphysema as well. And I don't know, I'm looking at probably, I don't know your options. Maybe I I, I don't ever done this before my mother-in-law. I've never ever done this. So I don't even know what grounds I'm stepping on.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Not understandable Well, look well what we'll do I'll put it in a 10,000 coverage.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : We can go up to 15, but that will at least get me a price for you to, to show you what we could offer at 10,000 coverage.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so to give you an overall recap of what we could do with our policies here. So we offer to ensure you're up to 15,000.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : We don't tell people how to spend the money. So the, the money can be used for funerals, but also if there's leftovers, they can even go in your back pocket. So if leaving a little bit of a nest egg as a goal, there is the potential to achieve that if it's within the range of three to 15,000.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Now with, with our coverage it because your mom's before the age of 75, we have a living benefit here called accidental serious injury.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Yep. Yep.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So in reference to that, if your mom passed, oh, if your mother-in-law passes away from an accident, an accidental based death, we triple whatever figure you're enthralled with.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So in that example of 10,000 coverage, it would be tripled to 30,000 and then paid out to the beneficiaries.
[5 minutes][Customer] : Yep. Alright.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : But if you're, if, if Doris had an accident and didn't pass away, but as a result of that accident, she's now quadriplegic or paraplegic as examples, then under accidental serious injury, you would call us, we'd triple the benefit and we'd hand it to Doris as a living benefit under accidental serious injury.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : And that you're allowed to make one accidental serious injury claim throughout the life of the policy without it affecting your benefit or your policy. So it doesn't affect the policy making that claim.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, umm, that just sits on the policy until the policy anniversary following her 75th birthday. And then just accidental serious injury removes itself.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : But the rest of the coverage remains in effect. So I actually don't need to speak to Doris. You have the capacity to get your mother-in-law covered today because I've already checked. Is she in astronomers and is she 18 to 79? So we are definitely able to go ahead with this. To recap your overall coverage, if you do go ahead with covering her today, for the 1st 12 months, you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months, you'll be covered for death due to any cause.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we'll pay a claim out in full to help you out with things like your medical expenses.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Oh, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep. It's pretty much the same as what we did for my wife.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Now, uh, there you go. I'm, I'm sorry, I and look, if you have any questions or, or something sounds different, please bring it up and of course, expand on anything. Now with our premiums, we actually designed our funeral policies to be level. And what I mean by your premiums level, we've designed that fortnightly for you to stay the same as your mom gets older there heading towards 85 when you guys will no longer pay for her policy.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So on your 85th birthday, all premium seats and you have nothing more to pay. But also we look at the amount you're currently insured for and we get 25% of that figure and put it on top of your benefit.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : OK, sweet.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So we call that automatic 25% bonus cover and that's just done for reaching 85. The other option available to you is at any stage 85 onwards, you can call us and request to close the policy under the early cash out option and we'll do exactly that, close the policy and pay out 75% of what you've insured for.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, I understand that. Yeah. Yep. Yep.
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So if we go ahead, we're covering doors for $10,000 in the event of an accidental death or accidental serious injury.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that should be Yeah.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : We're sitting at $57.69 a fortnight, so that's working out at $4.12 a day. OK, perfect.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, we got yeah.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Do you want me to adjust the amounts? Do you want to have a look at any other amounts between the three and 15,000?
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : No, which is this do what we've got now and all behind me that bad?
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : I just don't let my wife and I'll be going for your mom with 10 grand. That's $57.00. So combine mine, yours and all three together, get them together. So we'll probably write $100 a full of everything we can. It's a budget sweet. No, it's all good. Yeah. Yep. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : And OK, also we're real, so, umm, we give the real reward, uh, after the first 12 months of Mom's insurance, we're actually going to do a refund of 10% of the premiums you paid in that time to let you know at your policies renewal date with this policy, your real reward is $150.00 returned to you for that first year's insurance there now with the policy.
[8 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : I'll choose the bottom one back from you guys as well.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Well, and, and so with the policy also a couple of features. So I'm not sure what you guys got with your wife's sign originally, but what we're doing now is if you go ahead with the policy today, we're going to be sending out to you guys a complimentary will kit. It's valued at $30 cents free of charge as a compliment from our company to assist you guys in creating your mom's will amending it. If she's already got one out there. And if she, you don't want to do anything will related for it, you're allowed to hand the legal will kit on to other people.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So that's just a compliment we send out to you guys.
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : It's great.
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Now what what I'm going to do is I'm going to get you guys or get Doris covered over the phone today. But also I really should not be paid today. We generally collect payment within the next 7 days.
