[28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. You want my policy number?
[30 seconds][Agent] : Yes, please. Yep.
[32 seconds][Customer] : OK, 751887 452.
[39 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much. And then just your date of birth, please. Thank you so much. And then just the type of insurance, did you say that was life insurance?
[44 seconds][Customer] : OK, 21st of the 53, yes.
[54 seconds][Agent] : Thanks so much, Nancy. And then also, are you able to confirm an e-mail address that we may have on file for you?
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : I don't think I I I had a e-mail address.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : No e-mail. OK. Yeah, there's no e-mail on here. OK. So 35 Greta Rd. in, is that Warren Garra? Is that Longaratta?
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, from the weather.
[1 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yep. In Victoria 3677, we have the phone number you're calling off as well.
[1 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Now, what was the reason for your call?
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah. I was talking to a man before because I dropped my policy insurance. I said I'm going to cancel it.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : But my, my family is not happy because I got a problem in paying it.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : That's the that's why I said, oh, I got yes.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : No, that's understandable. So what has he said that sorry, they want you to, they're not thinking you should get the insurance.
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Like, yeah, I, I just to jump to conclusion as you know, yeah, because I'm, I got lots of bills to pay and I have no money to pay.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, that's understandable.
[1 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : So I'm thinking about drop, drop the policy. Drop the policy.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Like cancel that.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Instead of 88, instead of $82, can I drop into how many dollars more go down a bit, But at the moment I'm gonna pay $82. Yeah, I know.
[2 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Let's see here yes, so you and you are aware that with this one, umm, it is increasing every year based off of age and based off of the automatic sum insured increase.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : If you are looking for a different type of policy, we do have funeral insurances that do have a set premium. Yeah. The only, the only downside is to it is that you have a limit of what you can get for cover. So you can only get $15,000 cover for that type of insurance.
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : What? What sort of insurance is that?
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So this this is for our funeral insurance.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So it's basically sort of like the life insurance, except with the life insurance you do get more umm obviously, but your premiums are increasing every year based of two reasons, one being age and one being your automatic sum insured increase. Umm, But it also will depend on umm because of age, how much that premium would be set As for the funeral insurance. So I can have a look for you as to what it would be. But if it is more than what you are paying now, then obviously you'll probably not going to be able to afford that at this time. But let me see here.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Because the last time I have a looking at my letter the last time I'm paying premium of 9170 and I'm talking to someone and then she dropped it to 82 because I can't afford too high. So is there any chance I can drop it again?
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yes. So you can drop it again, but there's a limit as to what how much cover you can have for a life insurance.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : The benefit yes, The penny it doesn't need?
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So you are at 87,000 at the moment and you can only go down to 50,000. So I can have a look at how much it would cost to go down. Like what's the comfortable amount that you are looking to pay?
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Can I drop into 65?
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : $65, we'll see how much it will go to and keeping in mind it will go up next year and the year after that. So do you think this is a temporary or a long term concern?
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Maybe temporary?
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's see here. OK. So how much did you say? Sorry, did you say 65?
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yes, and I dropped it in 65. Is that alright? I know the benefit will go down, but it's alright.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's see 60. If you go to 70,000, your premium would be $66.03.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's alright.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Is that OK?
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 17.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, let me see. So that would be SE 70,000 of cover $66.03. If you want to bring it down more, I can look at 65,000.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : It'll be 6061 66, that will be fine. 66. Alright.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : The 66 is OK.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yes, thank you.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, let's have a look through here. I just have to get up some information for you just to go through this process. OK, OK, OK, so I have to read you currently what you're covered for. So we just have to go through the process like what you did last time.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, so your policy covers you for deaths due to any cause. At the moment it's for $87,000. Now the policy offers a terminal illness advance payment where if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, you can claim your full benefit as a living benefit. So this could help you with medical costs etcetera. And included in the Life benefit is a $10,000 advance payment that your beneficiary can request, which could help with the cost associated with the funeral.
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK. OK. OK. So please confirm that you agreed to actually let me see, sorry. OK, So please confirm that you agreed to the reduced benefit amount of $70,000 and understand that you will not be able to increase the cover benefits after you accept this change.
[8 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Is that OK? You agree? OK, thank you. So now you will get sent out some documents just reflecting this change.
[8 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : It will be effective from your next regular collection date as well. So this will be the 8th of December.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : A as in there.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : But other than that, we've gone through that today. Now is there anything else I can help you with?
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no. As long as everything is changed. I mean.
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it's changed.
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Goodbye. Yeah.
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So now your next premium will be $66.03.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So let me.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Now with this one, if you don't want it to increase based off of the automatic sum insured increase, you should get a letter around your renewal date. Now if you want to decline that, you can give us a call and you can decline that or you can decline it here with me today.
[9 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. I I don't. I don't. Yeah. I don't wanna increase because I can't. It it keep on increasing.
