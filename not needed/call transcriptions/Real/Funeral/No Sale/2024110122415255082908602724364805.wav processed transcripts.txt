OK, now as I said, the range is from $10,000 up to $100,000. You can nominate up to five people to receive the money. Grams, just so you know now, in the event you suffer an accidental debt, your family will receive triple the benefit amount.

[4 minutes][Agent] : So if death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit amount will triple And please to your family as well that they can request 20% of the benefit amount in advance to look after the immediate expenses for funeral whilst they're waiting for the rest of the money to be paid to them.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Now with this insurance because it's a term life cover, I do need to ask you some questions. They're actually very simple and easy. No need to go to a doctor and getting medicals reports. None of that. You only need to answer 7 yes or no questions relating to your health.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : If you are, if you are accepted Graham, and once you start the policy for the first 12 months you will be covered for accidental death. Only after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any calls. Is that clear?
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Very good. And Graham, there is a terminal ill, sorry, there is a terminally ill advanced payment attached as well. This is your living benefit. It means which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months UMM list you live by a medical practitioner, we will pay the money in full at that time to you whilst your lives so that for you can use it towards your treatment.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, sorry.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : I hope you never have to make that call, but it's there if you need it. Very good. Now this policy will cover you for a 20 year term or until your 85th birthday, whichever occurs first. And at this time, the life insurance benefit expires, your premiums will cease and your policy automatically converts to a final expenses benefit which is 20% of your life insurance amount and covers you for a further 10 years if you were to pass away at no additional cost to you. And Graham, during this 10 years, if you also have an option to cash out half of the final expenses benefit and and your policy all good so far, very good. Now Graham, I have the price right here. And at the moment you are an on an age pension, very good.
