[50 seconds][Customer] : It is 280 Court, Cherwell Bar, Birmingham 7320 rubygleam@gmail.com you know.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK. And what's your e-mail? Have you had a different one or is there some part missing to that? Perfect, that's fine. Contact number we have these 0444525572 umm, OK So what I can see here, that number that you also gave me is your PO, umm, funeral policy.
[1 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Rubygloom646@gmail.com Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Just calling that up for you now.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep. And how much do I pay per month, please?
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, so you do have umm, your umm benefit amount is $9896, you pay $44.61. However I can see it's going through renewal which may change the premium. You've got a payment that'll be due on the 11th of February. Let me just check maybe some changes. I'm just going to have a quick look. So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to place you on a brief hold. I maybe more than a couple of minutes. I just want to look at the payments here. OK.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine. That's fine.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Thanks for holding Jane. Apologies there for the hold.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK Yep.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : I just wanted to have a quick look at all your policy details because I can't see that you had children on your policy.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So, and I was just having a look at to see the, the changes that were made. Umm, So what actually is that? I can see that umm, the Zoe is still on your policy, however she is turning 21 in February umm, which means a letter should be on it's way shortly.
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : It's generally about a month beforehand to say that she will be removed off the policy. So just so you are aware there's and because your payments are delivered every month, so you do have your payment that's due tomorrow, which will be your normal 4461.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Then in, on February 11, it will be reduced because Zoe will come off the policy and that will be a, a partial because there's umm, she's 21 it at the like 25th of February. So that'll be a 3437. Then you'll receive your confirmation of the premium thereafter, once she's off the policy, and it you know the fully off the policy because the 11th of February is still partial, umm, the 11th of March, you're looking at your premium going to $30.29, $0.29.
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, $30.29. Alright, now can I organise to have her policy set up to kick straight over?
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So what, uh, no, we can't actually do that. So what will need to happen here? Uh, uh, there is that umm, you can give us a call and we can, or I can get someone to give you. Uh, might be a bit difficult in terms of because she has to come off the policy, but you can give us a call back, umm, before even her birthday. But basically I was going to say it's too soon to set her up now, but it's up to you. You can actually set her up if you like, umm, on a policy now. It just means, umm, that she would then that when they will stop and the other one, umm, you can't even start now if you like, or it can start her own policy after, oh, when she turns 21, but she comes off it. There's a couple of options there because it's a this one here that you do have because the one that you do have, we can't umm, increase this policy or umm, we don't have that policy. So it will be our current policies that Zoe would need to go on. So therefore she could take out her rights. That would not sure it it will come down to me now that you'd like to insure her fault.
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's a yeah, she won't, she won't do that.
[9 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yes.
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : It's she's like my other daughter 'cause they're young and life's not gonna hit him in the AI mean. Mind you yesterday my son-in-law saw our post to get hit by a vehicle and rushed to hospital. But yet it doesn't resistue in the brain that that can be them.
[9 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Oh, yeah, yeah, Yep, Yep, Yep. Now totally understand. But you can't set up on their behalf.
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[10 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but if that's something that you're wanting to do, umm, you can't set that up. And then that will still be the policy owner. You'll be that say that, say the purchase of payee, unless they pay, pay for it. They would need to speak to us to provide their bank details.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, I'll be the one that'll set it up like I have my daughter's one.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Oh, OK.

[24 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. OK so they will umm, run through the details. I'll ask you because it is another department to UMM, just to confirm the details.
[25 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[25 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : It sure will, yeah sure. Just realized I've spelled the address wrong. Umm, so I'll just re, but I've updated all that so that you should have all those details there. Umm, when they do umm, I'll start from you. So I'll let them know that your payments are on the 11th of each month now, umm, that's assuming where the uh, they won't be able to push it till February. Umm, that'll probably, if they do, it'll probably, if you want to set up, be set up on the same day. Would that be tomorrow?
[25 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yep, it'll be set up for Friday, the payment to go out, but I usually come in and bring up and pay it on Thursday.
[25 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : That's alright. So alright, so you can give them the dates from when you want this to start. I can just see that you do it monthly, which is the 11th of every month. So your payments all due tomorrow for the other two yourself and for Shelby.
[26 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, my pay doesn't come in, unfortunately until Thursday.
[26 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, now before I then transfer you, did you want me to fix the payments on yourself and Shelby to move it to when it fits?
[26 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : So there's this. Yeah, see The thing is, 'cause I'm on on disability, my payments aren't set on one specific date.
[26 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, did you want to, do you want to change it fortnightly to do it on the day you get paid? So it doesn't, not specifically on the month, umm, because that, that, you know, the month of change each, each month on depending on the day it falls on. But we can't set up fortnightly where it'll be, uh, on the fortnight that you get paid if you want to do that.
[26 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think that might, might work out a bit better 'cause I, I have gone back to work.
[27 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : No, OK, it's up to you.
[26 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : I've I've got a little bit of extra money coming in at this point until Social Security's D double dipping me on the cap 'cause they're wonderful that way.
[27 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Leave it.
[27 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : But yeah, I think for now I'll, I'll just ring up and and try it yeah. I mean, you guys seem to be pretty fit, you know, if we're like a couple of like a week or so out on the payment, so.
[27 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, no, that's all fine. It just means that if I leave it as it is now, and it's up to you and make that we would request it. But what I can do instead of requesting it, I can move it and then you can call us on a day that would suit you. Then you can call us to pay it without us being request us, without us requesting it from the bank. Would you want me to do that for you?
[27 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. That would be good. Thank you.
[27 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we'll do that. Umm, I'll put your details and then we'll go into that way. OK, I'll get out of this one. And if I might just ask you, Mary, that this is not to do with the beneficiary. This is just on the policy itself. Who's covered under the policy? Is it just you or is it you? OK, So what I'll do is I'll go into Shelby's first. That's fine. Thank you for that. Now we can update these. What would we update? The beneficiary? Certainly, which should be have the payment as I mentioned is due tomorrow.
[28 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[28 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but we'll move this so we don't request it. Umm, let me just get this for you to Friday. Yeah.
[28 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : So if we leave it to the 13, which is the Friday, Yep, then I'll call up to on Thursday.
[28 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : And then call on the Thursday, Yeah, Yeah. So we'll do that. So that way, we won't request in that way because what happens is that you might get a call from one of my colleagues saying, and the letter will be sent out saying payment was on, you know, it didn't go through this way. We won't request it until the 30th.
[28 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[28 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : If you haven't called us on the Thursday, it will automatically be debited. We'll request it on the, umm, the Friday the 13th. OK, so just leave that one for you. And so we're going to now request, uh, January's payment on the 13th of January unless you call us.
[28 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[29 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, I'll just leave that for you. So I've just done Shelby's so it is still set off for the months. It's just before we do update though, if I can just have you please concern that you do understand it, that information is true and correct. OK, So that's shall be done. You're just going to change, change the percentages? Yep. OK. So now we'll go into yours there, Jane. Oh, no, not at all. No. And you can, yeah. So when they, when you go through Zoe's, you can let them know the day you want that set up inquiries and changes, but only the policy owner. And if it does get set up on like the first one and you need to change it back so they're all in line. You can always call back and you'll speak to like one of myself, one of my colleagues, and we can then fix the payment dates that suits you. It's just to start that because if you start that up on the tomorrow, then it'll be requested tomorrow.
[29 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[30 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : But you started on say on the 3rd, 10th, it will be requested on the 30th. It'll be the 30th of every month, but we can always alter that, umm, after the policy is set up. Does that make sense? Perfect. OK, let me just fix this one here for you. Same for yourself. So for the one on, uh, tomorrow, we're going to request it on Friday unless you call us soon. So I'm just fixing that one as well.
[30 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[31 minutes][Agent] : Perfect. So that's done. So that's all done now and now is regarding the policies for yourself or Shelby's or anything else I can help you with.
[31 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : No, everything's good.
[31 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[31 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[31 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what I'll do is I'll now transfer you to our sales specialist and I'll set one up for umm, they'll run through it.
[31 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[31 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : You can let I can I'll let them know umm an amount that you're after, but they will run through you know what they start from and you can change that or get other quotes if you like umm, but I'll let them notes approximately the 9 1/2 thousand. Is that right?
[31 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Thank you.
[31 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : All right, so just hold the line for me, Jane. I won't be a moment.
