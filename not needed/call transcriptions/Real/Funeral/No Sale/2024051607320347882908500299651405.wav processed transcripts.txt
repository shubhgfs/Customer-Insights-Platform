[4 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : No. OK.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Now, it'll also come with a terminal illness benefit. This means that after holding the policy for 12 months, if your father was first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by medical practitioner, we'll pay the full funeral insurance to him so he can use the money himself for all of his medical expenses.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.

[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : And whatever amount you choose, the cost that I'll work out for you today, Lucy, that cost will not change. It'll stay the same price from now until Satyusa turns 85 years old, provided you keep the cover in place and make no changes. And if the insurer doesn't change the premium rates once he turns 85, you don't have to pay for it anymore. The payments topple you altogether and on top of that, you will then receive a bonus 25% cover that'll automatically be added on to your insurance amount at no extra cost to you, just as a thank you from us.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Oh, right.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, but you haven't. Your father will have an option though with this insurance anytime after he turns 85 years old. If he wants to, he can choose to end this policy early and cash out 75% of the benefit amount should he want to do that. But once again, that's optional and that's up to him to decide.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I see.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Any questions so far?
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, with with that last option I would, that is if you if you need before he reaches 85.
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Before he reaches 85? No anytime after he reaches 85, if he wants to, he can choose to end the policy early and cash out. Which means we will stop the policy and then we will pay him 75% of the funeral insurance amount if he wants to do that. It's optional, it's his choice.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I see.
[6 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, but don't forget Reme. Yeah, go for it.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : You know, one question, you know, like if if you just curse certainly passes away is is is there any would there be any money left for for for for for his?

[7 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I see, I see.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : And umm, what we do is we pay the money directly to the nominated beneficiaries when when your father passes away, OK.
[7 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : But that's after, after that is after his funeral expenses are paid. Yes.

[30 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[30 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So it thank you. So it says this policy does not have the savings or investment components. If cover ends prior to age 85, no benefit is payable and there is no refund of premiums after the cooling off period. Now, if you choose to retain cover beyond age 85, you will be entitled to an additional 25% of bonus cover from that date and you will not be required to pay any further premiums after the life insurance 85th birthday. The bonus cover is not payable if you take out the early cash AD option. Cover for each life insurance ends on the day prior to their 100th birthday. We'll pay the funeral benefit and bonus cover for the life insurance at this point. Your total premium for the first year of cover is $144.23 per fortnight. Your premium is designed to stay the same year on year and will only change if you alter your cover or the insured. That's the premium rates applying to your policy. You may pay more in premiums and the benefit amount over the life of the policy. Included in your premium is an amount payable to real insurance of between 28% and 49.5%. Calculate on the level basis of the life of the policy. Your premium will be debited from your credit card, which you are authorised to debit from and are provided to us. We may provide written communications to you by the e-mail address you have provided to us and this will include any legal notices that are required to provide you in writing.
