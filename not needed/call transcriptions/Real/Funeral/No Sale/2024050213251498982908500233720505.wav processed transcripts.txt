[2 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : That's good. Yes. So just quickly remind you just because it is my first time speaking to you today that our calls are recorded and any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. And my colleague Jen did mention that you wanted to look at some coverage there for both yourself and your partner. Is that correct?
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm already set up. I just wanna have my partner come on.
[3 minutes][Agent] : Yeah, sure. So we umm, because we want see an extra coverage as well. Like I said, up a new policy for yourself with your husband included. Or do we we just wanted to look at a policy just for your your partner.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Umm, I'm already set up with one.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK, so you just want to look at some coverages for your your partner.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Uh, yes.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's why we can look at the separate policy for your partner just because we can't add them to the your current existing policy.
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Oh, you can't.
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but yeah, just because you've already organized that previously in the past, uh, we can look at a separate policy there for him if you like as well.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK, so would that have to go through like with him himself?
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Now I'll just, yeah, No, no, we can, you can actually organize this on, on behalf of your, your partner. That's fine because it is a guaranteed acceptance policy. So there's no health assessments required. I'll just confirm because with the this joint did mention that you wanted to look at some coverage like some extra coverage. Is that correct? Or was it just looking at coverages for your, your partner just like that? That's fine. Well, I'll just confirm a few of his details so I can bring up some updated price in there for you. I'll just confirm. What was your partner's first name?
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Just one of my partner, William. Yep.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : WILLI AM and last name? Cool. And what was William's date of birth?
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Nicholls NICHO double LS 15th of the 1st 1985.
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yep, 1985. And he's also a male Australian resident. Yep, that's fine. Now with our funeral coverage, you can actually choose coverage of asking away from the $3000 up to the $15,000. Umm, what, What amount that you want me to quote you to begin with for Liam today?
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yes, the 15th.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Sure, We'll start off at the top. And if that's not suitable, just let me know. We can always look at bringing that down from there. Otherwise, and I'll just confirm just while that pricing is uploaded, I'll just explain to you, but more about how this couple works and what's included in the cost itself. But if you don't mind me, if you have any questions along the way, just let me know at any time. OK Natasha. So with that, as I mentioned, there's no AD, health assistance or medicals required on behalf of his doctors. Just means that for the 1st 12 months he will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only and after the first 12 months he will be covered for death due to any cause.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK. Now in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we can pay out the funeral insurance in full just about to help take care of any costs that he may need to cover during that time as well. Now the benefit amount that Williams insured for that this policy at Dodge triple if touched what he passes away unexpectedly from an accident. OK, so if he was covered for the likes of the $15,000 then that benefit amount will triple and pay out $45,000 for accidental death. Now the premiums that you pay for this policy, they are designed to remain the same each year so your premiums are level. But once he reaches the age of 85, he can actually choose the in this policy with us and we'll pay some 75% of the funeral insurance benefit amount obviously is still living.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Any questions so far?
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No, that's fine.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So we'll go through some pricing now that you've got a better understanding of how our cover works. Also I'll just reconfirm what one amount that you want me to quote you to begin with today for you extension. So base of the $15,000 of coverage, so this benefit amount would triple and pay up $45,000 for accidental death. And that fortnightly premium that comes to $22.49 per fortnight, OK. And then once he's held this policy with us for 12 months, so following his first policy anniversary date, we'll refund them back 10% of the premiums he's paid twice in that time, which is $58.49.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : The 15th Yep Yep that umm, the payments from that will be coming out of my account.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : That's fine.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : That's OK because same way as we set up your policy previously in the past, it's all done through that automatic debits come out of your preferred account and you can choose that time and date to start and then the future that suits you. But was the $15,000 of coverage, was that suitable?
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : And what was this William? Does he have the e-mail address that we can note down here? What was the e-mail address? We can send a copy of this policy documents to today.
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : You could just send it to mine. That's fine.

If there are no payments as scheduled until next Thursday, he'll still be covered by us over the phone from today for the $15,000 and attached to his policy is a 30 day calling off.
