[3 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.

[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. Perfect. Well, once again, umm, uh, Wendy, feel free to jump in, but with our new cover, it is really, really simple and easy.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Umm, firstly, it's called plain and simply the real funeral cover.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, nice and easy. And what this will actually do for you is touch wood, of course, and nothing happens. So just a couple of many, many years.
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : She's only 21, but obviously life is so unpredictable.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Umm should, should something happen to her, then you'll have peace to mind her knowing that the family, UMM will get paid out a lump sum payment, take care of any of her immediate funeral expenses and since she's an Australian resident and she's aged between 18 and 79, there's no medical checks, no blood that's required. We're going to accept her just the way she is.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : It's a guaranteed acceptance, OK right. But just please keep in mind because we're not looking at a medical history, sending it to the doctors. For the 1st 12 months of this insurance, you'll only be covered in that time for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. But after the first 12 months, you'll be covered for death due to any cause at all.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Because my other one left. Can't she be automatically covered?
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : If it, if it, if it lapse, no, because once again, umm, uh, you'd be, because you'd be doing a new cover then no, you would not. Uh, you, you, she would need to still wait out that 12 month waiting period for the accident to death. Umm, and once again, so for the 1st 12 months to be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. But after the first 12 months, it'll cover her for death due to any cause. OK.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Oh, Yep.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit included on the cover, which means after holding the policy for 12 months, if Jessica was first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, you can simply call them, let us know and we'll pay out the full funeral cover to her so she can actually use the money take care of all her all of her medical expenses, OK?
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : That's after 12 months.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Correct. Yes. So after holding the policy for the 1st 12 months, if she was diagnosed with that with a terminal illness with 12 months of affiliate by medical practitioner, then we can pay this out to her to take care of any of her immediate expenses.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, Umm, now you get to select the minimum cover of $3000 to get paid out all the way up to a maximum of 15,000.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No, it's 15,000.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : But what I do want to ensure you on this 50,000. No problem.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : We'll just keep in mind whatever level you choose the cost and amount to work out for you today, Wendy, that premium will not change for you.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, We designed the the premiums for our new funeral insurance to remain the same year on year. So provided that Jessica keeps your cover in place with us and make some changes to it, and if the insurer doesn't change the premium rates, the premium will remain the same from now until Jessica turns 85 years old. Once he reaches 85, you won't have to pay your premiums anymore. The payments stop at that age. And as a reward, she'll then be given a bonus 25% cover, which will automatically be added on to a benefit amount at no extra cost to you, just as a thank you.
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, she will have an option in many, many years to come. Uh, any time. Well, once she reaches 85 years old, she has an option to voluntarily end the cover early and cash out 75% of the benefit amount should she want to do that. Alright, well if you mind me asking though, is that pretty straightforward to you or did you have any questions for me so far?
[7 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I won't be around, so no, that's good.
[8 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Awesome, thanks Wendy. And as I said, you can choose anywhere from 3000 up to 15. You did mention you wanna have a look at the top cover, is that right?
[8 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : No worries. I'll quote you on the maximum 15,000. And we can always reduce it should you need it reduced. Just let me know, OK?
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : But if you did look at 15,000, you'd be paying one total premium per fortnight. It's just calculating for you now. Sorry, my computer's going really slow. So to keep you waiting, here we go. A total of $15.30 a fortnight. Perfect. Now just a few more things to consider here and keep this in mind and let Jessica know in the event that her death was caused by an accident, we will triple that benefit amount. So the family will now receive a total of $45,000 in instead of the 15 if Jessica's death was due to an accident. OK.
[8 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that'd be great, right. Is that after the 12 months or before the 12 months? OK.
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Also as anytime, anytime the policies in place, should Jessica pass you to an accident, we will triple the benefit amount, OK, Whether it's in the 1st 12 months or after the first 12 months, OK? Now also as I mentioned earlier, please be aware that your premiums are level, which means they're designed not to increase as just to get older. You may pay more in total premiums of the life of the policy than the benefit amount. And also please be aware that this insurance does not have a savings or investment elements. If you cancel the policy outside of the 30 days you'll cover will stop and you won't receive anything back. So just need to ensure you understand that as well. OK, great. So if you feel that's sort of comfortable for you to give you that financial security should the worst happen to Jessica, then what I'll go ahead and arrange is I'll get her immediately covered. So once we hang up this phone call today, your daughter will be protected and in the next 10 to 15 minutes you'll receive all the documents sent out to your e-mail address. So you can view it very shortly at home. Make sure that it matches our conversation. You are 110% happy with it.
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[10 minutes][Agent] : I'll also post out your hard copies to your mailing address here in Falconbridge. There should be an e-mail box with generally within 5 business days, but you'll get the e-mail in the next 10 to 15 minutes. OK.
[10 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK, Sir, can I do the the sign for Brendan please?
[10 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : And you definitely can, of course. Yeah. So we'll need to do them individually though, because because they're siblings, we can only do it as a joint if they're partners.
[10 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no, they're definitely not. Yeah.
[10 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, great, great. So we'll, we'll arrange Jessica's first and then we can do Brendan's as well, OK.
[10 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[10 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : But since they're twins and they're the same age, it'll be exactly identical for Brendan as well.
[10 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep.
[10 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Now no payments come out today, of course, even though just go be covered. Once we hang up the call, we'll let you select the date in the future that suits you when you like us to debit the first payment out from your account.
[10 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : So next. Yeah. Next Thursday.
[10 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : And this will allow you that time, so no problem. That's fine. Yeah, we can arrange it for that. I'll just let you wear the once you've read over the documents, if you're happy with it. Only on the day that you've chosen, we'll debit the first payment out from your account then, and then each fortnight from there on.
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : But should you reconsider or change your mind for whatever reason, that's absolutely fine. You can call back, apply to cancel the policy and you won't be penalized in any way.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : It will include a 30 day cooling off. Just in case. If you cancel in the 30 days, all the premiums you paid us in that time gets refunded back in full, so long as of course no claims have been made. OK Touchwood. Perfect. So firstly, do you have an e-mail address that I can send this out to?

[21 minutes][Customer] : No, no.
[21 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Do you have to stay with that $15,000 amount for him as well? No problem. OK, so I'll just remind you that once again that for the 1st 12 months Brendan will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only, but after the first 12 months to be covered for death due to any cause.
[21 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[21 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit attached, which means after Brendan's held the policy for 12 months, if he was first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to leave, my medical practitioner will pay the full amount to him. You can choose anywhere from $3000 up to 15,000 and same thing. The the premium will not change from now to Brendan reaches 85 years of age provided he keeps the cover in place, makes no changes, and if Thinker doesn't change the premium rates, then the premiums end all together.
[21 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[21 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : You won't have to pay for it anymore and you'll also then receive a bonus 25% cover. But same thing as I mentioned for Jessica, umm, he has the option anytime after he reaches 85 years of age, he can choose to end the cover early and cash out 75% of the benefit amount should he want to do that. OK, awesome. So I'll bring up a quote. I'll just make sure that it matches the same as Jessica's. So if you did want to look at 15,000, Yep. So same $15.30 a fortnight.
[21 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK, and find the account. Yep.
[22 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, once again, no worries.

And please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment elements. If you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you won't risk and you will not receive anything back. OK, awesome.
