[13 seconds][Customer] : I would like to just, you know, travel.
[22 seconds][Agent] : All right, Well, I can definitely, Yeah. Help get you joined up for a funeral cover. Our funeral cover is a guaranteed acceptance if you're an Australian resident aged between 40 and 79. Which means I can have you covered as of today. But just so I can pull up a profile for you, could I just confirm, please, your full name and date of birth? Perfect. And just so I've got spellings correct, I've got Sharon, Sharron, Juana and then I've got Jan, Jan, June and then I've got Thorpe. Thorpe, Perfect. And Sharon, Can I confirm that you are a female Australian resident?
[41 seconds][Customer] : Sharon Jane Thorpe 17th of the 3rd 69 1R June Yeah, yes.
[1 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you so much. And just Please note all our calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general in nature, may not be suitable to your situation, but sort best able to assist today. Sharon, what's made you decide you wanted to sign up for some funeral insurance?
[1 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Well, I was in another one and like it fell through because they went liquidated.
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I'm very sorry to hear that that happened. So yes, and they've just sort of gone bust. You don't have the cover anymore. OK, well just before we hop into explaining how our cover works, then just so you know, for your own sort of security with our cover, all the policies that we issue are underwritten by companies that are licensed by APRA, which is the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority. And as APRA approved life insurance, these underwriters are required to maintain at all times a minimum level of capital is mandated by APRA to ensure they'll meet the claims of their policy holders as they arise. So APRA monitors this through reporting, auditing and regular oversight. So we're underwritten by a company called Hanover Life Free of Australasia Ltd, one of the largest life free insurers in the world, in the case that real insurance wants to ever go bust or anything like that and ever is legally required to have minimum level of capital to be able to meet, to be able to meet your claims requirements. So, so yeah, you wouldn't necess. So if anything happened to our company for any reason, you wouldn't just lose your policy.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : But I I like the old page on my partner too.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : But OK, Well, I can definitely help with that too.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So, you know, yeah, can, yeah, we'll have a look at your one, then we'll be able to look at your partners as well. But yes, in terms of this type of cover, I'm sorry. Yes, of course. As you know, if you've had some in place before, it's designed to provide just a bit of financial protection for your loved one. It's a cash benefit anywhere from $3000 up to $15,000 just to help with funeral costs and whatnot. Sharon, did you have an amount in mind between 3015 thousand that you'd like me to start on?
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : 8000.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. I'll start on that 8000 and just while I load that up in terms of what you'll be covered for with us. So for the 1st 12 months you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. And then after the first 12 months Sharon, you will be covered for death due to any 'cause that's regardless of if it's a pre-existing condition or anything like that. It is absolutely any cause after the first year. And then in addition, there's a terminal illness benefit, which means that after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner in that very unfortunate case, Sharon, that we do pay the funeral insurance out to you in full. You get it while you're still alive that way. On one hand, you can use it for yourself to help with things like your medical costs and what not. Also that way you and your partner are able to plan for the future accordingly rather than having to wait to pass away to receive the benefit amount. And then umm, lastly, I did wanna let you know that there is a benefit that's built in for accidental death because we understand the kind of effect something sudden and accidental like that could have on your partner, on your loved ones in general. They might need more time off degrees, things like that.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So for that reason, Sharon, if death issued on accident, we actually triple umm, your payout.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : No.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So for an 8000 policy and accidental deaths, UMM would pay at $24,000 the term. I do have some pricing loaded up for you now though. But before I hop into that, was there any questions so far or sounding pretty straightforward?
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : How much was that? You know, it's 12 months and you're trying that. Is that an illness? What was that one?
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Oh, the terminal illness benefit. OK, so that's just part of the policy. I'm so yeah. Off.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : That's why that's why I was in the package.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Doesn't.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So it's just built in. It isn't like an extra or anything. But yeah.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner after you've held the policy for the for the 12 months, then as I said, we pay your funeral insurance just out to you in full. So yeah, it isn't an extra or anything like that. Think of it as an advance payment. So you get paid in advance rather than having to wait to pass away the term sharing terms of your cover. So for 8000 today you'd be looking at $18.92 per fortnight. So I'm a little bit under $9.50 a week. And the great thing is that your premiums are level, which means that they are designed to stay the same each year rather than going through yearly increases. And then, Sharon, once you reach the age of 85, your premiums will cease. You don't have to pay for the policy anymore. And on top of that, you'll also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover that gets applied to your benefit amount. So just to put that into an example, once you turn 80 five, 8000 is going to become 10,000 that you're covered for, and you're not going to have to pay for the policy anymore. Of course, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. Sharon, for $8000 of cover for yourself at $18.92 per fortnight, Did you feel that that would be suitable and affordable?
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : All right, perfect. Well then, yeah, let's pull up a quote for your partner as well. We'll total up the prices and if it's all affordable, then we can get both yourself and your husband's. I'm covered with policies over the phone today, but could I just confirm please your partner's full name?
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Stanley Reginald.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So Stanley. Stanley.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Oh, Yep, now his middle name is Reginald.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : And he said last name was Reginald.
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Oh, REJINAL Reginald J ININ regional OI double I Yeah, O double I sorry.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So Reginald RE OK, so REGINAL and then same last name as yourself O double RO double R OK. And then could I confirm please Stanley's date of birth?
[7 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : The 24th of the no.
[7 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Umm 20, 4th of no, 22nd of 4th, 22nd of the 4th 1953. And can I confirm that he's a male Australian resident?
[8 minutes][Customer] : 22nd of the 4th, 1953 yes.
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : And then for Stanley, would you be looking at a similar level of cover, the 8000 perfect. So just while I get he's quote loaded up, a couple last things to note is the cover. It does provide you with an early cash out option, which just means that any time after each 85 years, a phase that you are allowed to choose to end the cover. And if you do, we'll pay out 75% of the funeral insurance benefits. So if you opted for that at age 85, the cover would end. You'd receive $6000 as an early cash out that you can use to have AUC fit. You can have a massive 85th birthday party if you'd like. And of course the same thing applies for Stanley. And then of course you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. So just please go ahead this insurance to sort of a savings or investment element. So if you cancel that side of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you'll not receive anything back unless you're eligible for it and choose the early cash back option that I mentioned earlier it. So $8000 of cover for Stanley be looking at $39.79 per fortnight. So the total price for both of you to each have an $8000 policy would be $58.71 a fortnight. And as I said, level premium and each of your policies, the payments still end at age 85. Say for example, once Stanley reaches age 85, whose payments wouldn't you'd only be paying for yours at that stage.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : But yeah, so both of you to have 8000 of covering places that are suitable, Sharon.
[9 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Now that'll be suitable.
[9 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. Very glad to hear. Well then if that was the only suitable, the next step from here, as you requested at the start of the call is, yeah, I can get you both signed up. So you'll both be covered as of the end of the phone call today. So we'll get yours set up first and then we'll be able to set up Stanley's as well. Send out all the documentation for both of you as well. But yeah, just so I can get all that documentation sent out correctly. I'll just confirm both of your details.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : I've got 2672 like a Jelly town.
[10 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Sharon, could I confirm please an address just starting with your post code 26 722672 and which suburb or town was that and could I confirm the address there please?
[10 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Aiden Stuart Drive Kirby Waters like a Jelly town.

[10 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, like a Jelly gown.
