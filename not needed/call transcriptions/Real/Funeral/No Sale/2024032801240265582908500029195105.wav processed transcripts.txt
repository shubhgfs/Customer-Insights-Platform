[1 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK no worries. So what I'll do is I'll explain the main features and benefits and run through some options with you. Umm so alcohol is designed to provide a cash benefit of up to 15,000 to your loved ones when you pass away. They can use the funds not only for funeral expenses but also any other Yep, other final expenses like unpaid bills. You can only up to five beneficiaries to receive the nominated benefit amount and if that is due to an accident or chosen, benefits will triple. In addition, there will before the policy anniversary following of 7th birthday if you were to suffer an exit. If serious injury such as chodoplegia or paraplegia, then benefit amount will also triple. It's easy to apply. There are no medical checks. If you are an Austrian resident aged between 40 and 79, acceptance is guaranteed.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : And how much is that a month?
[2 minutes][Agent] : Do you have any questions for me so far or is OK a month? So I'll go through the quote with you once I read this other. I just need to let you know another thing as well before I go through the quote.

In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding a policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with terminal illness for 12 months or less to live by a medical infection, you'll pay your claim in full to help you with things like medical expenses. That sounds good. All right, so, so basically you can choose between 3000 up to 15,000. And a couple of things to note is that your payment R level, which means they're designed to stay the same as you get older. And when you reach the age of 85, your premium will see, so you have nothing more to pay and you will also automatically receive the 25% bonus cover. This will apply to your benefits.

So anytime after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose to end the cover and will you will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. This is this also applies to your partner if you have a joint plan umm so you you may pay more in total payments over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. Please be aware this insurance does not have a savings investment elements. So if you cancel out of the 30 days, your color will stop and you will not receive any anything back unless you unless you're eligible for and choose the early cash back offer.
