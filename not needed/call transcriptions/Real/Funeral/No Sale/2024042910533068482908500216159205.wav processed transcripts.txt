[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it was myself, but I can't remember. Yes.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : It was just OK, because it looks like I found a policy that had lapsed many years ago. So this probably is an older one that you're thinking.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Did you Take Me Out? It still cuts it from my account every four nights.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So you may have gone with someone else to set up a policy for them because this this right. OK, what does it show from the account like from the bank statement? What does it show?

This is one that started on the 16th of April, uh, 2014. Umm, so let me, let me go into that one and see sometimes people do have us confused with the insurance line that I mean, yeah, so this is lapsed in 2014, that 2017 actually. I mean, I, I can transfer to customer support, they'll run a search like I did, but umm, in the end, umm, from what I can see, it is these policies were all the policies that had lapsed many years ago.
[7 minutes][Customer] : None.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So you may have gone somewhere else, but you're saying to me, uh, on your bank statement. Does it, does it actually read? Because it wouldn't read real insurance. That's strange.
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : They still say real funeral in Toronto as it is blowing.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Look, I'll transfer you to customer support, umm, and then I can assist you there umm with with your, with your mother's one. If I can just get you to confirm for me your mother's full name and date of birth again there please.

[7 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Right.
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : No, I see it as because we've seen it in a different place before, so I'm not even remember. Is it Guilford? I have a Guilford O Marion, Wayne, Maryland now 2120.

[8 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Of my siblings.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because look for the details you had given me. OK, what's popped up here are two funeral insurance covers that have lapsed. First this one started 2009 and then another one started in 2014 and had lapsed 2017. So therefore there's no fault. No, through the covers in place. So therefore, umm, yes. So they don't have cover with us. So what I'm suggesting you do is maybe find out from your bank. Have you got your bank statement in front of you? Yeah.
[9 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I can't see my my benefit.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : If you could do me a favor, if you could do me a favor because, uh, just read out to like if you go, if you go to, you know, the, the deduction and read out the line what it actually says there. Umm, because it wouldn't read what you said.
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : It's just there's the number and then real funeral insurance.
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : That's all it says. Real funeral insurance on your bank statement.
[9 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it always says real funeral insurance and sometimes I've got relief from the real funeral insurance.
[10 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : I'm going to try again. Umm, so umm AH AANA.
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : ANAAHI.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Sorry AHI. There we go. I'll tell what I'll do. I'll transfer to customer support and they can see if they can assist you further, but I can't see anything from my end. As in an active policy. OK, I'll do that for you. All right. Thank you. Sorry again. Your your first name, Anna. Thank you. Anna. Hold the line. Hi. Hi, Beck.

She says I'm double checked with her so that this kind of doesn't make sense.
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Pop out his hand over as well. So you won't say that, but yeah.
[11 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Umm of the show that there's nothing active uh from yeah, I know that's what I was thinking umm so maybe you can have a chat with her. I really don't know what to say to her.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, sure.
[11 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Umm, yeah, she's yeah, she's she. She couldn't even confirm the address. It looks like that someone else has taken out this cover on on her mother's behalf a long time ago.
[11 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[11 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Not, not her. But anyway, I'll let me pop out of the lead so you can jump in. There you go.
[11 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : OK, so she was only providing a full name and date of birth so far.
[12 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yes. Name, date of birth. She couldn't provide the address or anything else. OK.
