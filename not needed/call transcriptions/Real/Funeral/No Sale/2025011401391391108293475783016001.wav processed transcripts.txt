[1 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, Colin, so I'll let you know. Firstly, it is very simple in how the funeral coverage works. So at the end of the day, it's designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones in the event that touched with something was happened to yourself, uh, or to christen this case. Now, the way that we do that is through a lump sum payment of between $3000 up to $15,000 depending on your personal needs. The cover does also include an accidental death benefit. So because accidents are so unexpected and potentially very sudden, we understand there could always be other costs left behind for your loved ones.

[1 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : You know, things like unpaid bills. So we'll pay.
[1 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Well, we, yeah, that's exactly aside as well. But we want want this now.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. All right, so we'll pay out a three times benefit from noting you that from accidental death. Now Colin, the cover just for the 1st 12 months he'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only after the first 12 months he'll be covered for death due to any cause.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminally illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if he was first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a registered medical practitioner, we'll pay out the claim in full in that situation so that you can get, so that he can get get the best medical care or anything else you might need as well. OK.

[2 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : The cover one.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Uh, well, I hope I don't remember.
[2 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. Yeah. And so the cover, once he reaches the age of 85, the premium stops. So you don't pay anything after the age of 85. We will still cover him no problem. And we'll increase the level of cover.
