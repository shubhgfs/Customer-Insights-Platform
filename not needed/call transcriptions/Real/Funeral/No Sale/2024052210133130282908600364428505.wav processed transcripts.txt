[56 seconds][Agent] : Christmas, Ian, Shane has told me exactly what I'm going to help you out with today and I'm happy to do so. As I send you a call for myself. I'll just let you know calls are recorded. Any advice we provide is general in nature and may not be suitable for your situation. Excuse me and if I could just get you to say your name and date of birth please. Thank you. And you are a male and an Australian resident. Wonderful. And now she just said that she's already giving you the quote on the $8000, which was $26.83 per fortnight. It's obviously going to be on top of what you currently hold.
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it's saying night 10/05/1958 Yes, yes, yes.
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Now just to quickly run through everything that I need to touch on before I get this one finalized on this $8000 Yeah, the first 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only. Then after 12 months, you'll be covered for death due to any cause. Uh, we also include a terminal illness benefit on this policy as well. So if you were, uh, sorry, after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we'd pay your claim in full. And of course, UMM with regards to this, because it is separate to the existing insurance you have. You can choose between 3 and $15,000 if you wanted to. That's up to you.
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, Yep.
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, now the premiums are leveled, which means they're designed to stay the same as you get older. And after you reach the age of 85, you can either choose to end your cover and we'll pay out 75% of your, uh, funeral insurance benefit on this policy, or you can keep the cover in place and we'll provide an extra 25% bonus cover on top. That's up to you.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Alright.
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK Now, umm, with this one, uh, and, uh, we can get this organized to obviously coincide with your existing policy or it can be an alternating day. That's up to you, but we just ask as a business, uh, we generally collect payment in the next 7 days. Is there a day in the next 7 days suitable for you?
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : That's the the next seven days. What's the date today?
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Today is, uh, Wednesday the 22nd, yeah.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : That's it. Doesn't matter what day, no.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : I mean, the earliest we are able to start is today and then it'll be fortnightly from there for you on a Wednesday.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Oh, right, yeah. If it's no good, is it? Looks just trying to work it out. Yeah, I'm trying to get it worked out with 10 today.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : That's but, uh, both in your court, you tell me what day is suitable for you, right?
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : I've done a what dates? What dates the other one? What dates the other one.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what day did you say sorry, the other one. Let me just double check that one for you.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Men's Matthews.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : The other one is due on the 30th, which is next Thursday. Yeah, we can do that.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : How's that sound if they come out together?
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sounds good. Uh, now you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. And please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside the 30 days cover stops and you don't receive anything back. Uh, and just confirming, 55 Racecourse Rd. in Barnsdale andwehavesmythy1958@gmail.com for your e-mail address.

[5 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : What would be easiest for you to list down?
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Oh, right. I don't know what I've got on another policy. I know it's direct debit, but I don't know. Well, it doesn't matter, does it? There you go. Yeah, it has got the debit card and so that's 5.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Now, I mean, if you have your BSP account number or debit card either or it's all connected to it all righty then for security purposes, just before you provide me those details for security purposes while obtaining your card details, the call recording will stop and we'll recommence after we've collected your details.

You have agreed to take out a single real funeral cover with the following cover. Ian Smart is covered for $8000 in the event of death. In a case where death is accidental or if you suffer a defied accidental serious injury, the benefit amount will triple coverage for accidental deaths only for the 1st 12 months of cover, with death by any cause or diagnosis of a terminal illness covered thereafter. Accidental Serious injury cover for each life insured under age 75 starts immediately and ends on the policy anniversary following the life insured 75th birthday. Once a life insured reaches age 85, you can choose to voluntarily cancel that person's cover to receive a lump sum payment of 75% of the chosen benefit amount. If you take up this early cash out option, you'll no longer have a right to claim under the policy for that life insured. This policy does not have a savings or investment component. If cover ends prior to age 85, no benefit is payable and there's no refunded premiums after the cooling off. If you choose to retain cover beyond age 85, you will be entitled to an additional 25% of bonus cover from that date and you'll not be required to make any further payments. Sorry. And you'll not be required to pay any further premiums after the life insurance 85th birthday. The bonus cover is not payable if you take the early cash out option. Cover for each life insured ends on the day prior to their 100th birthday. We will pay the funeral benefit and bonus cover for the life insured. At this point. Your total premium for your first year of cover is $26.83 per fortnight. Your premium is designed to stay the same year on year and will only change if you alter your cover or the insurer adjust the premium rates applying to your policy. You may pay more in premiums in the benefit amount over the life of the policy, including your premiums in the amount payable to real insurance of between 28% and 49. 5% calculated on a level basis over the life of the policy. Your preview will be debited from your credit card, which you'll authorise to debit from and have provided to us.
