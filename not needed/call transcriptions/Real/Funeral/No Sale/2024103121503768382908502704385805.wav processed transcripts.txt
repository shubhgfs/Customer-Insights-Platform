[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Not a problem.
[8 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much for your patience. Sorry it took a bit long. OK so I've got 2 quotes for you. So if you increase the benefit amount by 3500. So currently you are 6800, umm, 72, I think. Umm, So if you increase by 3500, your fortnightly premium increases by $24.04. So it will go up to $51.13.
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, problem 54.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : And then if you increase by 4000, it's a additional of $27.47, so $54.56, yeah.
[9 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[9 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So I'll just tell you how, how much exactly would that be? Because yeah, it's a, it's a, umm, odd amount at the moment because it does increase every, uh, Year 5%. So that's why it's, uh, 6382.
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : So that takes the whole policy up to yeah, yeah, I need to make it an even amount, no.
[10 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : I'm not sure if I will be able to do it the exact 10,000 umm So it might be slightly uh here and there so you're currently 6830 sorry 2382 dollars yeah.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : That's right, yeah.
[10 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So if the increase by say 3500, that will come to $9882.00. So if they increase say by 4000, umm.
[10 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Takes it to 54,054 a month.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So 6382, so, but that benefit amount 6382 plus 4000, that will be $10,382.00. So that will be $54.56.
[11 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, I'll take it to that one. Thank you.
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yep. OK, not a problem.
[11 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : We'll just have to go through some, umm, scripting with you.
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK.
[11 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. I just lost my husband, so.
[11 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Umm, sorry about that.
[11 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah. So I need to increase. Mine just wasn't enough to cover his so. Yeah.
[11 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yes, sure. Yeah, well, actually it does allow me to change it to 10,000, umm, exactly if you want, because when I was giving you the code, it didn't allow me. So if we do $10,000, umm, currently you're paying $27.09, a new Ford like Ford Magazine Premium will be $51.57, the $24.48 extra. Would you like that?
[12 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that'll be fine.
[12 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So I can do exactly 3618 dollars?
[12 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine.
[12 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK yeah exactly 10,000, yes, sorry about that.
[12 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : So take it up to 10,000 and that will be. No, that's alright. And that will be 54 a fortnight.
[12 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 50, no $51.57 because we are increasing it by 3618 dollars. That's the odd amount, but it does allow me.
[12 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yes, yes, 51.
[12 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So you're happy with 10,000?
[12 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's fine.
[12 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK so can I confirm that you are an Australian resident?
[12 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I am.
[12 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So Gene funeral, uh, so this final expenses insurance cover provides your family members with a cash benefit of up to $15,000 in the event that you pass away. It can be used not only for funeral expenses but also any other final expenses like unpaid bills. If that was due to an accident, the benefit amount is tripled. I do need to advise you that there is an exclusion on this policy. For the 1st 12 months you're covered against accident. Is that only after 12 months? It covers that due to any cause including an accident. This applies to the increase amount only. So it will only apply to that 3618 dollars.
[13 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : So you're telling me that for the 1st 12 months I'm not covered by death insurance? Is that right?
[13 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : But only for that increased amount, not for the previous amount.
[13 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I see.
[13 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So, so for 6382 you're still covered, but for that 3618 dollars you're not covered for for the 1st 12 months. Yeah, yeah.
[13 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Just for the so the first truth for the extra coverage I don't get. Yeah, right. Understood.
[13 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : For the extra, yeah, yeah, Yep.
[13 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[13 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Included in your cover is the cash out benefit, which means once the oldest person covered under the policy turns 85, you have the option to cancel your policy and receive a cash out benefit of 50% of the funeral insurance benefit amount for one life insured. Yeah, so you also have a sum insured bonus. Once the oldest person covered under the policy turns 90, premiums are no longer payable and you will also receive a 25% sum insured bonus on the funeral insurance benefit amount at no additional cost to you from the age of 90. If you opt to cancel your cover and receive the cash or benefit, it will be 50% off your increased funeral insurance benefit amount for one life insured. So you're currently having have a policy for umm $6382. What would you like that? You already told me? So you want your benefit to be 10,000?
[15 minutes][Customer] : Yes.
[15 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, just checking if I need to read anything else. OK, so to complete this request, your new benefit amount will be $10,000 and your total premium will be $51.57 per fortnight. Yeah, your premium is fixed, which means it will not increase based on age. This policy has automatic index indexation, which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 5%, so your premium will increase accordingly. You can opt out of this index session, umm, each year. We will let you know in advance of any changes to your benefit amount and premium. Do you have any questions? OK, So are you happy for me to increase the final expenses insurance, umm, on your policy now to $10,000?
[15 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah, yeah.
[15 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So the increase is 3618. OK, just completing that. Now give me a second. Perfect, so this has been completed for you and will be effective from your next regular collection date. We also send out new policy documents reflecting that change. So umm, as I mentioned, the next payment is due on the 26th of March, which is next Tuesday $51.57. Your benefit amount is changed to $10,000. Umm is there anything else I can help you with or any update today? Umm, do you have any questions?
[16 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yes, No, no, that's fine. Thank you.
[16 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[16 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : No, that's that's great.
[16 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
