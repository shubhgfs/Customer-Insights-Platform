[6 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, I'm just, I'm here, I'm all here, uh, to help you.
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No worries.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So, uh, in addition, yeah, yeah. In addition, if you were to SU suffer an accidental serious injury before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit amount will also be tripled.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So would you like me to repeat that so you can note that down?
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. No, I've got that one.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Great, awesome. Uh, There are no medical checks in it and acceptance is guaranteed if you're an Australian resident aged between 18 and 79.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So for the yeah. So for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death if either main insured or partner is under 75 and accidental serious injury only after the first 12 months, you will be covered for death due to any cause. In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding the policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with the terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay your claim in full. The level of cover ranges from $3000 up to $15,000 and you can get covered just for yourself or you and your partner. Yeah. So once you reach the age of 85, your premiums will cease and a 25% bonus cover will automatically be applied to your benefit amount. Our funerals, I, I'll sorry. Our funeral insurance cover also provides you with an early cash out option at any time after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. This also applies to your partner if you have a joint plan. So what benefit amount would you like me to quote you on?
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Just just the basic one for me and my wife.
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Also, you would like to do a joint plan, is that right?
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Let me. No, no, no. Let's stick to one.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK. Yeah, yeah, no problem. Of course, we can just start with you and then.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Just let's stick to me for now. Yeah.
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem. Well, yeah, yeah. OK. So we can start from the top. So 15,000. OK. So, so filled in four, $15,000 of cover. The premium will be $24.71 per fortnight, $0.71 per fortnight. Yeah, we will send you a free will kit valued at $30.00 for each policy.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : So let's do the 15,015 thousand dollar one, hmm, $24.00 and say again, what's that?
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Let me just clarify that for you so I don't give you any misinformation, if that's OK.
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'll just pop you on hold real quick. Sorry about that Filden.
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, you're right.
[10 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Thanks for holding the line till then.
[10 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : You're right.
[10 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I just clarified for you. Umm, So what the will kit essentially is, is umm, because obviously when purchra uh, purchasing funeral insurance, uh, it's like illegal. I just spoke to my manager. He just said umm, what it is. It's just like, you know, obviously you're legalized way of umm, accounting for who your beneficiary is. So who you send your assets and money to and whatnot. Uh, yeah. If does that make sense? And because generally people do buy like they have the option of buying it outside of their funeral insurance because perhaps some covers don't offer it, but we do as a welcoming kind of thing to just allow you to do that immediately with our freewheel kit. Does that make sense? No, no, no, of course I'm, I'm here. I'm definitely here to help.
[11 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, I'm, I'm lost to be honest, but yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's let's go back a few steps.
[11 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So file away some questions at me like I've I can uh yeah, yeah, of course.
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : So with the let's start from, I wanted the $15,000 one, right? And my pre, my premium is $24.71 for Fortnite, right.
[11 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm, yes, that's correct.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : And then it gives me $642.06 per year. OK.
[11 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[11 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : And now before we move forward, if I pay annual premium, does it go down or the same doesn't matter?
[11 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, so just to re clarify, umm, your annual premium would would then be $642.45. Yeah. So yeah, yeah, that's right. So, umm, just right here. Sorry. Just give me one second.
[12 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, based on my calculations, you're right.
[12 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Let me pull that up for you. Thank you for your patience by the way. I really appreciate that. Filled in.
[12 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No, that's alright.
[12 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so your premiums are level filled in, which means they are designed not to increase as you get older. If if that if that's clarifying what you were asking.
[12 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : No, that thanks for that as well.
[12 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's alright.
[12 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : And that was going to be one of the questions I had online. But what I wanted to know now is 'cause I don't pay any of my premiums or any affiliations weekly or monthly, I pay annual fee and forget about it. You know what I mean?
[12 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah.
[12 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : You know what I mean?
[12 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. So you're. Hmm. Yep.
[12 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : So I need to know, I need to know how much do I pay per annum for this policy before I go ahead with it?
[13 minutes][Agent] : So yeah, exactly your calculations were correct. So 600 and oh if, if if what I'm what the number I provide right now is the same, umm $642.45 per annum is is the annual price. So now it doesn't change. So fortnightly monthly, it's all calculated the same. So there is no increase decrease for fortnight, monthly or annual. Does that make sense? Exactly, yes, yes, that's right.
[13 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : So, yeah, so is the the payout like whatever in case of tragedy, it doesn't change that, OK.
[13 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Umm, well, as I listed earlier about the umm, triple, so our real funeral insurance cover provides cash benefit of up to $15,000 to your loved ones when you pass away. It can be used not only for funeral expenses, but also any other final expenses like unpaid bills. So if death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple. So that's kind of that area you were, I think touching into. So that about how that how your umm claim is affected. Is that right?
[13 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Right. Yeah, OK.
[14 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : And then yeah, just just to re clarify as well in case you're confused as well. So if you were to also suffer an accidental serious injury, which is so if you were to suffer an accidental in serious injury, sorry, before the policy anniversary following the 75th birthday. So things such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit amount will also be tripled.
[14 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[14 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So that yeah.
[14 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[14 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Does that kind of clarify what you were asking? Yeah, OK, no problem. No, no. Great questions, great questions.
[14 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, no, here's the here's the here's the question that I need to know. You guys provide that opportunity now. I'm not, I was not born in Australia. OK.
[14 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, no problem.
[14 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Now the question is, I'm South African.
[14 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Mm, hmm.
[14 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : I was born in South Africa. The question is, my mom and dad are still alive, OK.
[14 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Hmm. Yeah, mm. Oh, no. So unfortunately they have to be an Australian resident for us to insure them.
[14 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Is it possible for me to insure them or even if they are not in Australia, Right.
[15 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[15 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK. All right. No, that's all right. I just wanted to know if that is a possibility. That's all right.
[15 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : No, no, that's a that's a great question. It's definitely something a lot of people are curious about. And I'm I'm here to help children. So don't don't worry. Like if you, no matter the amount of questions you have, just shoot it to me and I will try my best to answer it.
[15 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : And then what I wanna do. What's your name?
[15 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Brendan.
[15 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Eh, Brendan? My question, do you know Brendan, is because I like taking options and then I like playing with number spreadsheets and all that. Comparing obviously, so I can spend the night or a week. Do you have because I want to do the numbers if it's only me, if it's the kids, if it's me and my wife, whatever the case may be, you know, I want to know. And if I take 5010 thousand or if, if, if there's two of us, me and my wife, what's the maximum we can take policy out like $15,000 each or or what?
[15 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yes, Yep, but you can take alrighty. Oh, OK. So you're asking with the joint account together, how much can really the both of you take out like climb back, you mean?
[16 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like you, you know, policy like how? What's the maximum we can ensure?
[16 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Mm Hmm, Yep, definitely. So So then again, like, I really appreciate your patience with me. So I, I will just clarify these things because, you know, obviously my duty of care to you. I really want to give you the accurate information. So I would just put you on hold. So I'm I'm not giving you any false figures. Is that alright? Thank you so much, Jordan, and I appreciate your patience. Thanks for holding the line children. You still there?
[18 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Hey, what?
[18 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So just to clarify with the joint account, right. So as I stated earlier, you do have the, as you have asked for the $15,000 cover for the funeral. Umm, if you're, if your wife was obviously opt for the same thing, then in terms of what's what you can claim it's just the 15,000 each. So you both have access to individual 15,000. So if you were to consider it more as like a, an individual cover per person and then obviously you're tripling umm, as a result of, you know what I had explained earlier. So like, umm, if death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple and, or if, uh, you suffer an accidental serious injury before the policy anniversary following the 75th birth, birthday, uh, such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit amount will also be tripled. So that applies to both you and your wife, umm, separately. Does that make sense? Yep.
[19 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[19 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[19 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[19 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So if you would just consider like how we are doing it right now, we're we're looking at a single cover for yourself, umm, essentially it'd be the same for your wife even if it were a joint account. Does that make sense?
[19 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[19 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Mm Hmm.
[19 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : That's, that's alright.
[19 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Did you, Yeah. Did you have any other questions or would you like me to move forward?
[20 minutes][Customer] : No, I've got no question. We can move forward.
[20 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, great. And obviously along the track you can ask more questions if you'd like as well.
[20 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[20 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, awesome field. And so your premiums are level again. Umm, as I said before, so your premiums are level, which means they are designed not to increase as you get older. We have a real reward attached to the policy. Following your first policy anniversary date, we will refund you 10% of the premiums you have paid in that time. So how does that sound? Yeah, that's good. So would you like me to quote you on another amount or are you happy with the $15,000 that I've quoted you on?
[20 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, not bad on the 15,000, right?
[20 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, that's right. And that's the maximum coverage. Yep. So can I confirm the premium of $642.45 per annum on the real funeral cover is affordable to you?
[20 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yes, at the moment. Let's go. Let's go ahead with it.
[21 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's yeah, Awesome. Yeah. And Y, yeah, awesome. Thanks, Jordan. So you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. So please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back unless you are eligible for and choose the early cash back offer. Yeah. So just give me one second. How does that all sound to you children?
[21 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, I'm still digging it in. I have to sleep over it.
[21 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. So you know, we have two options available for you. So obviously you said you wanna sleep on it. So thank you for letting me know that I can e-mail or mail you a quote with our PDS so you can sit down and look over the policy documents together. But the other option, yeah, but the other option is I can set up the policy for you today and send you out all your policy documents and provide you with immediate cover over the phone today.
[21 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : And 1st, let's go with the first one.
[22 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : The first one. OK, Alright, so let me just create application for you right there. Alright. Sorry about the wait. It's just give me one moment.

[22 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Yeah, of course. Of course.
[22 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : I just want to, I just want to compare and have a look at the what I'm what I'm getting myself into.
[23 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no problem at all. OK, let me just do that. And then so you would just like me to send you the emails and whatnot. Yep.
[23 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, just e-mail and then so I can cover, cover and squeeze at it.
[23 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Awesome. OK, so hopefully this is the last time, but I will just pop you on hold so I can just sort that out for you.
[23 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[23 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So obviously you're not waiting awkwardly while I'm just in silence. Thanks for that.
[23 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : No worries.
