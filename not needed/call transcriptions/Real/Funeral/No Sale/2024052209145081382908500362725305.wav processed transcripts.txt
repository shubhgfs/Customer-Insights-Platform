[7 seconds][Customer] : Yes. My name is Ricky Gray. I am from Tasmania on on behalf of my mother, Carol Gray, she had a funeral insurance policy in her name that she was paying my funeral insurance. Now she has since passed away and I want to cancel that that policy.
[26 seconds][Agent] : First and foremost, My condolences there, Ricky.
[29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[28 seconds][Agent] : I'm sorry to hear that.
[29 seconds][Customer] : Thank you. Thanks.
[30 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a worry. So this is a policy for yourself, is it?
[36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah. Correct. Yeah. It was coming in my mum's account, but it was apology wasn't for me.
[37 seconds][Agent] : OK, Certainly. So let me have a look at that first.
[46 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'll just quickly remind you that the calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes.
[47 seconds][Customer] : That's fine.
[47 seconds][Agent] : Any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable for your situation. And if you could kindly just state your full name, your date of birth and your address for me.
[58 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Ricky James Bell Gray 2 Rescue St.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Lovely. And what's the post code there for Swansea? Thank you very much. And just confirming apart from your mobile number, we've called in, you've called in on, we also have 0362578930.
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Swansea Date of birth 12th of the 3rd 73, 7190 130 Yep, that's correct.
[1 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Lovely and no e-mail, is that correct?
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. Let me have a look at your policy. Bear with me. I'm just waiting for those details to load.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right. 02723. Yep. 730. Yep.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK so we do have your policy 73107 correct now. I do just need to let you know the cancellations are required in writing now. I can see the policy has been enforced since September 2012.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yeah. Yep.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : You are currently insured at the moment, so $8865 and with a fortnightly premium of $9.30.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's correct.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So that's covering. Yeah. OK. So just to remind you of the policy that you do have, because obviously Mum set this up for you.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yeah.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So I'd say to provide the loved ones with the cash benefit, as I said, $8865 in the event you pass away. Now it is designed to be used for funerals and other final expenses. However the beneficiaries can use it they choose. If death was due to an accident, the benefit amount is tripled. So that would be 3 times whatever your sum insured is.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : When that was first set up back in September of 2012, for the 1st 12 months you were covered against accidental death only and after 12 months it covers death due to any cause including accident. Now, part of your policy, included in your cover is a cash out benefit, which means once the oldest person covered under the policy turns 85, you have an option to cancel your policy and receive a cash out benefit of 50% of the funeral insurance benefit amount to that one life insured. You also have a sum insured bonus. Once the oldest person covered under the policy turns 90, premiums are no longer payable and you'll also receive a 25% sum insured bonus on your funeral insurance benefit amount and no additional cost to you. And then at the age of 90, if you opt to cancel, you'll cover and receive the cash out benefit. It will be 50% of the funeral insurance, the increased funeral insurance benefit amount to that one life insured. OK, now with that there, we'll see. I mean, I know mum has passed away and my absolute condolences to your family and yourself.
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Thanks.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Was there any other reason that you're looking to cancel the cover?
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, the frozen all my mum's bank account, so nothing was taken out of it.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a worry.
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : And yeah, and I, I want to get different life insurance for that fee. Insurance from my local bank, yes.
[4 minutes][Agent] : OK, so you do know that we would still pay above and beyond anything else that you do have. So this would see if you did have something with your, your financial institution, we would still pay above and beyond that.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, at the moment they 'cause they're frozen all my mum's account, so enough to be going to take in, be taken out of it.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I understand. Yeah, I completely understand. I mean, it is something that you can update to your account by all means because you are the, even though mum paid for it, you are the policy owner.
[4 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, I'd, I'd rather cancel at the moment.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : You want to cancel it?
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So just to keep him.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Just keeping in mind if you do proceed to cancel it there Ricky. And then if you do wish to look at taking out a new policy, so you would be starting afresh. So it would be a whole new coverage at the time that you have already served on this cover won't apply and it will be a new policy. And just to give you an idea, let me just bring up those details because this one you've had for quite some time. Let me have a look and see what the difference. And the policies do work slightly differently. So let me have a look.
[5 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : So I'm only trying to the bank details into my name. Would it be any less or any more or.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : No, it'll be the same. It'll be that same premium that you're currently paying.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Right. Sorry, but yeah, OK. Right.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Just give me a minute and I'll just go up to the car and get my details and my thanks. Yeah.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : She had had bowel cancer.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Oh, no, they reckon. I've heard that. They say that's one of the worst, too.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. And the day she got diagnosed with bowel cancer, I had a attack same day.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Oh my goodness, Ricky.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I come on, I get worried. I had a attack and I've now I've got a a mechanic open two of the heart valve in the chest now, So.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Oh dear. See.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : And I say my mum down here, the local hospital, I sit in my couch for 10 days will her until she passed away.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : And that's it. You'd, you'd do anything for your mum, wouldn't you?
[5 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes][Agent] : Like, you know, they're just.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : And I said I got a phone call and I said kiss from the fire because she couldn't talk, but she knew there and I kissed from the phone. So I'll be back. I mean, mum don't go nowhere. And I walked outside so I can't talk. And so my mother had passed away and I went walked back inside and she went she took her last breath before I got back inside the back into the hospital. Right. OK, I'll give them my my details.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Oh, oh, Ricky, sure, let me just go my update.
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : I bank would have been go bank.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Sure, just a moment. I'll hop in there for you. We'll get that updated. Alrighty, the BSB when you're ready. Yep.

[7 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, so your regular payment is for $9.30 and I just did a quick look at if you were to take out a similar, so a similar sum insured. So to give you an idea, if you had cancelled this and set up a whole new policy at 88000 where you're currently insured for 8000 nine 8865 you'd on the newer policy. Just to give you a heads up that premium would start on $8000 at $15.81.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So you, you are looking at about another $6 or so more if you, if you had to cancel this and then looked at a newer one later down the track.

[8 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep. You do that from my bank. Yep.
