[2 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : MMM, Yep, that's fine.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Now in case the line drops out. Wendy, your best contact number, is it the mobile number that you're calling from? Yep. No worries. And I'll confirm that Jeffrey is a male and an Australian resident.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : The one I'm on now, that's right.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. All right. Thank you. Well, what's prompted you to look into funeral Cover on behalf of Jeffrey?
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : I was just sick to you as mine. And I thought, oh, he cancelled his. He had a problem.
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : I was just thinking of of mine and I thought he had a problem. I joined somebody else.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : I joined him up with somebody else and he had a terrible problem with it. And he ended up, they gave his money back. So that was that. And I just thought, you know, we're all getting older. Like, yeah, yeah, he's nearly 8 and so am I.
[2 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Oh, right, yeah.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : And it's. Yeah, it it was just a spur of the moment thought, actually.
[3 minutes][Agent] : Yeah, no, that's alright. Thanks for reaching out to us. Because the real funeral cover is available to Australian residents aged 4279 that can apply, but once they turn 80 it would no longer be available to apply for. So now you got called in at a a good time. So he used to have one and then yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Well, I've got my, I've, yeah, yeah, I've got mine with you. And I've got that.
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Oh well, OK, no worries.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I've had that for years.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, so you might already know a little bit about the cover, but depending on when you took it out, because this current funeral policy has been in around for the last few years, I'll tell you a little bit about TH this cover.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[3 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So it is a cash benefit that we'll be paying to his loved ones, like yourself when he passes away. Now the funds can be used not only for fee and expenses, but also any other final expenses like unpaid bills. He can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this nominate benefit amount. Would he be choosing you to be the beneficiary? Yeah, yeah, that's fine. If there's anyone else, you can also add them in as well. If death is due to an accident, then we'll be trooping the payout for you.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Under those circumstances, it's easy to apply. There are no medical checks if he's an Australian resident aged between 40 and 79.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Just so you know, Wendy, for the 1st 12 months he will be covered for accidental death only, but after the first 12 months he will be covered for death due to any cause. In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, meaning after holding his policy for 12 months, if he were first diagnosed with a tumour illness for 12 months or less to live by, a medical practitioner will pay the claim in full to help with things like medical expenses.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Right. Oh, so, so that applies to mine or not.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'm not sure about yours. For yours, yeah, you probably have to reach out to our support team because they've got access to existing policy details about able to tell you. Yeah.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Oh, so they, they, things have changed over time, have they?
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So it it could be different. Yeah, yeah, it could be different. I'm not too sure compared to that.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : But if you already have cover with us, yes, S speak to our support team that way up to any questions that you have about your policy.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So it's $3000 up to $15,000 is the range of cover he can be covered for now.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Probably 5.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Wendy, what was the benefit amount that you'd like me to get your price on 5000? Yeah, sure.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So 5000, OK. And just just while I get that price now you might pay more in total premiums other than loss of policy and the benefit amount. So please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment elements. So if you cancel outside 30 days, your cover will stop. You're not receiving anything back unless you're eligible for and choose the early cash back offer you Prem, which I'll explain a little later. Your premiums are the premiums are designed to stay the same. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Now we need the price of $5000 for Jeffrey, $65.56 a fortnight. Does that sound affordable or is there another amount you'd like that?
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : No, that sounds OK.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, all good. And when he reaches the age of 85, Wendy the Prince will cease, so there'll be nothing more to pay.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : He'll still be covered with Real. And he will also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover, which applies to $5000, means that he will receive an extra $1250 of cover. So from that age, he's got.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : That's what I thought.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : That's at 85, correct? Yeah. So from age 85, you have a total amount of $6250 of cover.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Right, right.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : So a little bit more to leak to you to take care of those funeral expenses that early cash at option at any.
[7 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : That's that's just one. That's only he doesn't get that back. That's only if he passes on.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sorry, just one that's only he doesn't get that back. That's the only passes on. What do you mean? Just like I understand your question. What do you mean? Mm, hmm. Right, yes, correct. Yeah. So nothing more to pay from 885, he'll still be covered so but and he'll get automatically the 25% bonus cover as well.
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : He said as AJ he got, he doesn't pay any more, right, right, right.
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So he's the total amount that he'll be covered for would be $6250 from that age.
[7 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : So he's covered for that. But it, it, it doesn't come back automatically. It doesn't come back from the like it's only if he passes over.
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yes.
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Right, OK.
[8 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So, so basically, so if he was to pass away before 885, for example, it's a $5000 pay up, but from 885, the part figure will be $6250 because of that bonus of 25%. Yeah. And also the next part probably answers your next question. We'll touch it on that question that you asked, that early cash out option. At any time after he reaches 85 years of age, he can choose to end his cover and we'll pay him 75% of the fuel insurance benefit.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[8 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So it's an option when he reaches that age or he can just keep it going because he doesn't pay any more premiums and he gets that bonus as well.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, right.
[8 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[9 minutes][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So, yeah, that's pretty much the fuel cover and now that you've got the price and you have a better idea of how this how it works. So how's that all sounding?
[9 minutes][Customer] : Could you also tell me what it is? Oh, it sounds quite good. Could you also tell me what it is for $3000?
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yes, yes, yeah, I can do that. Just yeah. So with $3000 when he turns 85 with that 25% bonus, that means the total would then be $3750 of cover from that age. Now for $3000, the the premium amount is $39.34 a fortnight.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Right, right.
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yes.
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, I'll keep both of those in mind if that's OK.
[9 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Is there an amount that you're leaning more towards at the moment for Jeffrey? Are you leaning more towards 3 or I think $5000 would be better?
[9 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : And umm, oh, umm, I, I haven't sort of quite thought about it.
[9 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[9 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : I mean, you know, you won't be going any in any lap of luxury. So, umm, it was 39 something good.
[9 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So it was 30, 9 something 30, yeah. So it's 3000 dollars, $39.34 a fortnight.
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Look, I think I'll take that one.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. And so you'll be paying on his behalf?
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I will.
[10 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK, that's fine. We just note that you are the purchaser, so I'll be able to get him covered for that $3000 benefit amount and I'll get all those POS documents posted out to his address today so then he can select you to be the beneficiary. Have a read through these documents. Any questions, our contact details will be on the document. This policy also gives him a 30 day cooling off. Just in case he changes his mind. You're not required to pay anything today, Wendy. You select your preferred method of payment and you select the payment out of your choice so you can push it out to a day in the future that that's suitable. Are you happy to continue?
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes please.
[10 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Alright, thank you. I'll just note your your details. So I just so just on our end here just shows that you're the one purchasing on his behalf. So that means you can also make an enquiry on his policy as well. And these will be the security questions that we'll be asking when you call in and enquire.

I've just set up a policy for her, for her husband, but since she has some questions about her existing policy, I'll just pop out a lead for you. OK, I'll just pop that.
[28 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Well, good transfer. Two things.
[28 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. I'll just drop her in. Here she comes.
