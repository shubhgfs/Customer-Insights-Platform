[5 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Umm. When it comes to that time when your mom passes away, though, Paul, you and your brothers are able to use the funds not only for her funeral, but also for other final expenses that you may have during that time.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Alright, yeah.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : And your mom's able to nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Oh well. Yep.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. But with her policy pull, there is also an accidental death benefit attached.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Alright.
[5 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So if your mom was to pass away due to an accident, you and your brothers will receive triple the chosen benefit amount. And it is easy to apply, so there's no need for your mom to undergo any medical checks.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Oh well, yeah.
[6 minutes][Agent] : All Australian investors age between 40 and 79. Acceptance is guaranteed. Perfect.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Alright, Yep.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : And if your mom was to suffer an accidental serious injuries such as quadriplegia or paraplegia as an example, before the policy anniversary following her 75th birthday, the benefit amount will also triple for her.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Alright. Yep.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : And for the 1st 12 months poor, she will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Then after the first 12 months, she'll be covered for death due to any cause.
[6 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Alright. Yep.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Another benefit that her policy will hold is that provides her with an early.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Understand.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Also, it provides her with a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding her policy for 12 months, if she was first diagnosed with the terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay her claim to her in full while she's living to be able to help you and your family with any medical expenses during that time.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : But you're able to choose cover between 3000 up to $15,000, Paul. And I'm able to go through as many pricing as you're needing me to today. And her premiums are designed to stay the same as she gets older. So they it's pretty easy to budget around.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : They won't increase and decrease during that time. Perfect. And when she reaches 85, the premiums will stop. So you won't have to pay anything more after that.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Right. Yep.
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Uh, when she turns 85, she will automatically receive a 25% bonus cover that will be applied to her benefit amount for her.
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Oh well.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : But you can have a read about our premium structure on our website. If you're wanting to find more, find information about that as well.
[7 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : And the last benefit that her cover holds as well before I pull up some pricing is that it provides her with an early cash out option. And what that is, Paul asked. At any time after she reaches 85 years of age, she can choose to enter cover and we will pay her 75 of the funeral insurance benefit. That is completely optional. But during that time that she's finding that she's wanting to take up that option that's always available for her. Perfect. But let's go through some pricing. What amount of cover would you think about looking out for you and your family during this time? Call.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Alright, yeah, look, my mum could say if anything could happen she wanted to think amazing. So it's an actual funeral, they're not cheap.
[8 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : So like we don't have a flop for her or anything. So it's a lot of money. So I know cremations aren't that expensive. So we're looking to get $15,000 to cover everything. So hopefully if anything will happen, we, we far.
[8 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. That's understandable. Paul, I'll look at the 15,000 for you then And if you find that the premiums maybe a little too much for you and your family, let me know. We can look at a lower amount of cover because keep in mind there is the accidents or death benefit as well where it will triple.
[8 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : So Yep, yeah, I'll get ya.
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : And in future if you find that your mom may require more amount of cover, you can always apply for a top up cover subject to her eligibility during that time as well.
[9 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, that's not too bad.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : So for the 15,000, the fortnightly premium is $61.81 and with her cover as well. Do you know if your mom has a current will in place call or?
[9 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No, nothing.
[9 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. Well, we will provide her with a free. I understand Paul.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Well, she's got, she's got, she's got nothing anyway, 'cause otherwise I don't think that's why she hasn't shrimped without getting the wheels done.
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, well, with her policy, we will provide her with a free online legal will that's usually valued at $160.00. But we will provide it to her for free with her policy.
[9 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, Alright, Yeah.
[9 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : And we also have this thing called a real reward attached to her policy, which is the following her first policy anniversary day. We will refund you 10% of the premiums you have paid in that time just as a thank you are staying with Bill. But in terms to the four nightly premium for the 15,000 port, do you find that that is suitable or would you like me to look at a lower amount?
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Oh, well, yeah, it, it, it is suitable.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Mm Hmm.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : It is suitable. It's just having I have to speak to my $2.00 as well because one will all be paying for it. So yeah.
[10 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, 100% poor, but I will let you know as well as that you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. So please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element.
[10 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I do that.
[10 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back unless you're eligible for and your mom decides to take up the early cash back offer.
[10 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[11 minutes][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : But I know you mentioned that you wanted to speak to your brothers, which is completely understandable. Paul, I just want to confirm your e-mail address is yourfirstandlastname@outlook.com.
