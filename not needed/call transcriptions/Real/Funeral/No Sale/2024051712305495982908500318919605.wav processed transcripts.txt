[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : In addition, if you were to suffer an accidental serious injury before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit amount will also be tripled. There are no medical checks and acceptance is guaranteed if you're an Australian resident aged between 18 and 79.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yep. So now for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death if either main insured or partner is under 75 and accidental serious injury only after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause. In addition, there is a Terminal illness benefit, which means after holding the policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with the terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay your claim in full. So the level of cover ranges from $3000 up to $15,000. And you can get cover just for yourself or you and your partner.

[6 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : This also applies to your partner if you have a joint plan. So what benefit amount would you like me to quote you on?
