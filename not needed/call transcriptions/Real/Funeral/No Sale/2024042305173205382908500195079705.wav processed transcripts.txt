[29 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[29 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So yeah, what we can do, if you like, I can give you a call, umm, and set up the life insurance on a later date when he's there and I could give umm, if you like, or we could set up the funeral insurance for him. Now until he gets the life insurance, it's up to you. Uh, I don't know.
[29 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : I don't know how long. How long does it take to do funeral cover?
[30 minutes][Agent] : Look, it's only, look, look, it's only up to, so it's, it's roughly around the same time. This is just less. There's no questions, no medical questions.
[30 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[30 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Umm, it's acceptance guaranteed as long as you're an Australian resident aged between 18 and 79. Uh, we could set up the cover for him. Umm, there is like when it comes to funeral insurance though, because there's no medical checks or medical questions for the first two months, you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. And then after the first two months, you'll be covered for death due to any cause. OK. Now, in addition, there's also the terminal illness benefits. That means after holding a policy for 12 months, if you're first diagnosed with the terminal illness for 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, we will also pay the claim in full. But without federal insurance, you could choose cover between $3000 up to $15,000. And the premiums are levels, so they are designed to stay the same as you get older. But it's totally up to you.
[30 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[30 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So we could sit, Yeah.
[30 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : So how much if I went to 15,000, how much is that? Like how much is that cover?
[31 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Just give me one moment. Now also, when he reaches the age of 85, he can choose to end his cover and we will pay 75% of that choice of benefit amount. If he continues to keep his cover beyond the age of 85, the premiums will stop and we'll also add 25% on top of his choice of benefit amount. Yeah, with the 15,000 is $21.52 a fortnight.
[31 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[31 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Do you want to go ahead with that? Yeah, yes.
[31 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : I'm just wondering, so so with mine, so with my life insurance, did mine have the funeral cover as well?
[31 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So there's a advanced payout of ten $10,000 of the benefit of the benefit amount to help with for no cost and any other final expenses.
[31 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
