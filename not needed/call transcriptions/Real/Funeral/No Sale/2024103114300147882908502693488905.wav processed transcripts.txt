But if you wanted more funeral cover, we do have a funeral policy that is available if you wanted me to quote you.
[22 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Do you have a sub for funeral colour or just just for, you know, someone because that, that funeral policy, that's for me. Is that right?
[23 minutes][Agent] : So it's all for you. The life insurance is covers only you and the funeral advance comes out of the life insurance. So that'd come out of the $400,000 there and they yeah, can get paid too. So you've listed your beneficiary today. So Leslie will be able to request the $10,000 advance out of that 400,000 to get the funeral looked after and then one that way once the funeral is all done, then we can go through the rest, the rest of the life insurance.
[23 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[23 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[23 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Whereas if we had a separate umm, funeral policy, then that's, umm, just runs as it's own funeral policy where we just work with her, get the proof of death, which, uh, doesn't have to be a death certificate like it does with the life insurance. It can be like a proof of death.
[23 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, something hospital or something like that.
[23 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but yeah, we'd work with her and yeah. And yeah, exactly. Yeah. So because the the insurance amount isn't as much on the funeral insurance, the requirements to pay it out are a little bit less stringent for it. So that that way, because we understand it's especially with the funeral, we know that that wants to get done and dusted as soon as possible. You know, like last thing we want is to have waiting around for it to happen. So yeah, we do work the best way that we can with them.
[24 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so at the funeral, I can have anybody on that list, is that right or?
[24 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Ah, if you had a separate funeral policy, yeah, you can have anybody listed down as the beneficiary there. It is designed not just for the funeral insurance, but that can be used for like final expenses as well.

[24 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[24 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[24 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : So what what's the price on that for?
[24 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : I'll just pull that up here. So for the funeral insurance, it depends on how much you're looking to get insured for. The minimum is 3000 and the maximum is 15,000.
