[21 seconds][Agent] : Sure. So firstly, I'll remind you that our calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes and any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable for your situation. Tony, would you have a policy number there at all?
[35 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I do so if I can read it the the print is so small on these things, but I'll give it a give it a go.
[47 seconds][Agent] : Sure.

[59 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. It's just loading up and just your name in for your date of birth. And what e-mail would we have for you?
[1 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, the same thing. And date of birth is 26354. e-mail is yrungaj54.nsw@gmail.com.
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, thank you. And we have you residing at unit one of two Mark St.
[1 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, that's correct. Correct.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Foster, NSW 2428 and we have a mobile in the system of 0412480430 and you're calling from your home number.
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Well from my mobile.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Is that correct or OK 'cause that number come up with an 02 number, that's all.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Oh OK.
[1 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Thank you.
[1 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Well, there's an 8 two number will be home line 999-135-9349.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you. Alrighty, so I can see you are in our guaranteed general cover. Firstly, I just need to remind you the cancellations are required in writing. Now I can see you've had this a couple of years. Was there anything in particular?
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : No, certainly as you can probably appreciate, I hate using the word cost of living, but but yes, and and and at the moment I just need to bring my budget back, back under to accommodate other expenses.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Alright, alright.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : And, and this is 1 that I, that I can, uh, pass yeah, give away. I've only got 1 beneficiary and I am on place and my beneficiary is quite financial. So a little bit of an inconvenience, but I, I think for me, uh, without you needing to, uh, just all the wires and don't, umm, I need to know the process of canceling.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a worries. I'm definitely here to help you.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[3 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So your funeral cover at the moment, it's for 7300, correct?
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Lovely. What I'll do is I'll just explain the cover and then I can give you all the details in order how to cancel the cover. Now, the policy itself is there to provide the loved ones with the cash benefit if you were to pass away. Primarily, it is defined to be used for funerals and other final expenses. However, the beneficiary can use it how they choose. Now with your policy, if death was due to an accident, the benefit amount will triple. In addition, if you were to suffer an accidental series injury before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, such as quadriplegia paraplegia, the benefit amount is also tripled. So in the and that's currently sitting at the 21,900. Now please don't take this wrong way there Anthony, but if you were in an accident and sustained a serious injury and we paid you at your triple sum, that's not the end of the cover. The death benefit is still available to your loved ones on UMM on the policy as well. Now when you first set that up back in 2020 for the 1st 12 months you were covered against accidental death or accidental series injury only and after 12 months covering death due to any cause so well and truly served your waiting period on that. Now this insurance comes with our payback guarantee. Now, what that means is the benefit your loved ones receive will always be the benefit amount you choose, or all of the premiums you paid for your funeral insurance, whichever is higher. So you really can't. This profile, you keep the cover, you're making the changes to it. In addition to this, your premium will never increase unless you change or cover, and your premium will reduce by 5% every five years you'll hold the policy. So it is to find the word. The longer you hold it, the cheaper it's gonna become. And then the longer you hold it, potentially the more insured you'll end up being covered for umm, depending on how long the policy's been in place. So, umm, just to keep in mind, if you were at any stage to revisit and come back, the new policy would be based on your age at that stage and everything then recommences, umm, the other thing that you do have with the policy and never locked into a predetermined amount. So you can always make changes to the cover and that wouldn't be stopping and starting. It would just be a continuation of cover and just quickly there to let you know at 5840 for natural courses and 17,520 for your accidental death and your series injury that brings that premium down to 3191 because that just gives you sort of an idea.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Thanks for thank you for having to say what you needed to say care of real, real life. But yeah, I, I appreciate. I I heard and totally understood everything that you said.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Absolutely. I can assist you with that.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Thank you, Sandy, that basically I'm, I'm, I'm saying I would like to cancel and, and, and yeah, I, I, yeah, as I said, you're like prices of groceries and everything else. I'm not the only, I'll even be cancelling the Netflix, so you're not the only one. But yeah, I I just need to cut some expenses down at the present at this time.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Absolutely no, not a worry and you are more than welcome to to come back and revisit a policy further down the track. Then your policies are just slightly different to what you are on. It is just a fixed premium for the term of the policy. So just to keep that in mind. Umm, and this policy that you are on, Sorry, what was that?
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : In the premium portal, yes, so I'm just in the premiums would naturally be adjusted up something that can account my age and that's not so.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Ye, yes. So it'd be based on your age at the time of application, of course.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I'm comf, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm thinking at this point in time, uh, wealth insurance is, I've appreciated even though, uh, even though just the last year or the type of thing. And I know I'm, uh, walking away from 2 grand or, or whatever it might be in that sense, But as I said, uh, a small day-to-day living expenses that tells me that this is the right option for me to do it at this time. So yeah.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Nothing like completely understandable. I think we all know it when we head off to the supermarket and fill the car and all those things that we need to to do on a day-to-day basis. So I think we all feel that pinch very much, you know, without a doubt. So, you know, completely understandable.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : I'm sure you, I'm sure you, I'm sure you're probably hearing that a little more than what you were hearing a couple of years ago.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Absolutely. And are we looking at a long or short term with the current situation? Do you have any idea or?
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : I I think I'm kind of lucky to be alive. I'm 68 going on. I think I'm pretty hap. I think that, well, you can see that I think I'm pretty happy where I'm facing. My health is relatively good. So, yeah, as I said, uh, uh, and I've, I've got a little bit in the bank and, uh, as I said, I've only got 1 beneficiary and he's quite financial. So all and all, I, I, I believe it's the right option for me at this point in time.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : That's a good thing that sure not a problem. Absolutely. Just so you are well, well aware, the minimum is $3000 and that's $16.39 a fortnight for $3000 with 9 for your accidental debt, an injury. So that would be the starting point on this policy.
[9 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no.
[9 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Sure. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call there, Anthony, we do just ask for a very simple letter in writing. Now you do have the option of the fax post or e-mail. What would suit you best?
[9 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : As I said, I please, I wish to cancel e-mail ideally.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely. Will it be coming from your e-mail address that you read out to me, the young aj54.nfw@gmail.com? Perfect. If it comes from that e-mail address there, Anthony, no signature is required. If you send it from any other e-mail facts for posts, that's when we do ask you to sign and date that. Do you have a pen and paper handy and I can give you all the details?
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, yes, Yep, e-mail.
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Let me know.
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I've got pen in hand.
[10 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[10 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : So we'll just start again. SBR. Yep. Yeah. Service. Yes. OK.
[10 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So our e-mail address, it is all lowercase service, SERVICE VICE at and then so at and then the next part's 3 words, Anthony, but it's written as 1, so no spaces in between and it's all lower case real life cover.
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Real life cover. Yep. Got that.
[10 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : And it I said about to say it does have the 2L's in there. One for real, one for life. uh.com dot AU.

[10 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So the service at reallifecover.com dot AU pop that in the address you line in the subject line there, Anthony, you can pop in cancellations and then in the body of the e-mail, it's quite simple.
[11 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. 9 plus the yeah date of birth. Yes, got that. Yes. OK, nine. Then what was the other thing?
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : It requires your name and date of birth and then a really simple statement along the lines of please cancel my policy and include the policy number and then pop your name and today's date below that today, today's date.
[11 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : 09 plus 8MM? Hmm, OK.
[11 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : And then just hit send. Once we receive your cancelled e-mail, our admin department will process the cancellation of your policy as per your PDS. They will then send you written confirmation of the cancellation within seven to 10 business days from that day. Do you just need to note that until such time the policy is cancelled, your payments will continue as normal and the cover remain in place? Having said that, when you do send that through to us, Anthony, give it say 5 minutes or so, you'll get a reply from our customer care saying thank you for your e-mail. That will be your confirmation we've received it and that's generally processed within 24 to 48 hours of receiving your request.
[12 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, very good. Look, *****. Yeah, when I took out the policy, I was very happy and I thought it was a good deal.
[12 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Mm Hmm.
[12 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : And now, as I said, yeah, financially, if I can cut costs.
[12 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Things have certainly changed in the last few years, hasn't it?
[12 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : And as I said, it's not just this, whether whether, whether we, we and all the rest of me, if I can, if I can bring it back by a couple of grand a year, which is my intention. Yeah, I'd rather have it now than yes. So I think you understand.

[14 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : I don't know where you are, but yeah, yeah, you understand.
[14 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : It's sort of like, oh, of course it's, it's kind of nice to take advantage of when you get a bit of dry weather to, you know, try and get the lawns done because otherwise they start to look awful.
