But the girl told me yesterday that umm, it wasn't, it was downgraded to this accident one because of umm, Abmi that umm, was up and above, obviously what you, your classes, umm, so-called normal, umm, but yeah, so umm, but yeah, I, I, that's for a treat because umm, at the end of the day, OK, nobody knows what's around the corner, but if I have an accident, OK, I get, I think it's on the 1st of April. I think it goes up to 311,000.

[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And there's two numbers were 0268969845 and then mobile 427969845. OK, I'll just have a yeah, you what you were saying.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I forgot where I was up to. Oh, well, yeah, I mean, OK, if I have come the 1st of April, I think the amount of time if I have an accident or, or, or you know, can't work or whatever, I don't know, umm, I get Chandra. Well, my partner gets 211,000, but if I have a heart attack or whatever, we'll get nothing.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yes, yeah. We can see the policy of that accidental death and serious injury cover at the time you were probably lost. So you went for the application but were declined.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : I, yeah, Oh, well, I didn't realise. I know that 2009 is a long time ago, but umm, yeah, I, I just get the things every anniversary, the letters saying, yeah, you've been, you know I will, yeah, we take you on board for another 12 months. Whatever it is, I'll just shove them on the desk and don't really read them. To tell you the truth.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : You're saying OK.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Umm, I just know that it comes out of my, umm, of my credit card every month. But yeah, I just, when I, I read the one that come the other day and I thought, well, this is a bit pointless because if I have a heart attack or something, my husband gets zilch and I've been playing all this time. Umm, So yeah, I, I don't, I don't know what to do.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Well, it's part of this policy.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : We don't offer anymore, but it Pennsylvania pays if you were to pass away due to an accident or if you were to suffer quadruplagia, paraplagia, hemiplagia, blindness, deafness, all total and permanent loss of use of two limbs as a direct result of an accident. Mm hmm.
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I'm not being rude or horrible, but 311,000 ain't gonna go nowhere really in in this day and age. I don't. I mean, I've paid since 2009. I don't really want to cancel, but is there an alternative that I can take apart? You know, scrap the accident and the disability 1 and go something else.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : I'll have a check. Like what? What sort of other policy you're looking at?
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Well, I don't know, you tell me. I mean, umm, she said yesterday, uh, because I'm now 6764, uh, the life, the insurance for the life thing that ran out at 64. So OK, that's out of the picture. Umm, So what else is there then?
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : There's a life funeral and the term life policies.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK, well what's the term life policy?
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So that one there that's a bit different from the life because the age eligibility is between I'll just yeah, you're within the age eligibility. I can give you a clone.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : How that one works is so it's covered you for death due to any go cause excluding suicide in the 1st 30.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : I thought so for the first four months, sorry, you'll be covered for accidental death only and then after the first 12 months you're covered death due to any cause. It also offers a living component.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So it has a terminal illness advance payment, which means after holding the policy for 12 months, if you were provided a first diagnosis of 12 months or less to live by medical practitioner, you can claim the full benefit that you have as a living benefit goes towards you know, medical costs etcetera included as well you're.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So your beneficiaries can also request an advance payment of 20% of the term life benefit amount to go towards funeral costs.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : In the event if you were to suffer an accidental death, you will receive double the benefit amount on top of your term life benefit.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Now, once your cover has remained in force for 20 years or when you turn 85, whichever comes first, the life insurance benefit expires and the premiums will cease. At this point, though, you'll cover will automatically convert to the final expenses benefit, covering you for 20% of the life insurance benefit amount for a further 10 years at no additional cost to you. But that's the term life policy we have.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK. So in comparison to what I pay now a month, what's the what would? What's the difference in payment?
[6 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So $25,000 term life would be $41.51 per fortnight.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : All right.
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : The levels start at 10,000 go up to $100,000.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, so here. So it's an extra.
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : What's that policy?
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK, so you've got something else up your sleeve.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Well, there's a funeral policy as well we have.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK, so what's the funeral policy?
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll have a look at that one. I'll just go. So the levels we offer with that one must between 3000 and $15,000.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. Mm Hmm.
[7 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : That's pretty much paid as a cash benefit to the family and then you pass away.
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : They can use it on whatever they want. It's not restricted to funeral costs.
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : If the death was due to an accident, the benefit amount triples.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : In addition to all that, if you were to suffer an accidental serious injury before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, similar to your current one, such as quadruplage or paraplage jump, the benefit now will also be tripled. So the first four months on this one, you'll be covered if you were for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. And then after the first four months you'll be covered for death due to any cause. There's no medicals or anything like that as a guaranteed acceptance.
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm. Well, that's what I thought I was getting with the first one, but obviously it didn't any. Sorry, sorry.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : The policy also offers the same Oh, you would have went. Why would have went through the questions then you you probably would have went for the questions.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I did, and I answered them honestly. Umm, but yeah, you, you advertise, you know, no, umm, you know, no blood tests required and none of this and none of that. Well, obviously there was a a hiccup, but anyway, anyway, sorry. Go on.
[8 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, there's health and livestock and some, some customers can't apply for life insurance. We there's no medical tests, but there's questions that we ask.
[8 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah. OK. Mm, hmm. Mm, hmm.
[8 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : And if you disclose certain sort of conditions, it declines with the funeral policy, though it also offers a terminal illness advance payment.
[9 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were to provide a first diagnosis of 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, you can claim the full benefit as a living benefit. Once you reach the age of 85 on this policy, the premiums will cease and we automatically add a 25% bonus cover to your benefit amount. The last two things is once you reach the age of 100, the cover will end and we pay you both the few insurance benefit amount. Yep, in force immediately priority 85th birthday and the 25% bonus cover. The policy also provides you with an early cash out option, so at any time when you reach 85 years of age you may elect to end the cover and we pay you 75% of the few insurance benefit. That's the two policies available.
[9 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK, so, uh, the funeral one then. So how much will that cost me a fortnight?
[9 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So levels between 3000 and $15,000. Which level do you want me to start at?
[10 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Well, does what I've already paid since 2009 go into this as well? Or is that just now P on out the window?
[10 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : No, Yeah, yeah. You wouldn't have there.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : So all that money I've been paying all this time since 2009 does not go one iota to if I change to a funeral policy.
[10 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : There's no, no. It's just a whole, it's a complete different policy.
[10 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : It's a bit of a joke really. Umm OK tell me what? What's the funeral one if I go say 15,000?
[10 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So 15,000.
[10 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : A fortnight. Hi. Kidding me. Look. Yeah.
[10 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : $58.47 Yep it's based on your age and well 10,000 is a bit cheaper. It's $38.98 a four knife for $10,000.
[11 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Hmm hmm. Oh I, I, I feel sick in the stomach to think that if I just say forget it, I've paid out all this money, umm since then and I'm getting nothing.
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Keep keeping in mind though something there, but keeping in mind if something was to happen, you'd be covered on the policy for that amount. So that's the reason why you pay the premiums.
[11 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Gee, I know, I understand that. But do you really think in this day and age, 311,000 I'm a nurse. I know, I I know what goes on 311,000 ain't gonna go nowhere to help me if I had an accident and I'm lying in a bed. And to tell you the truth, I wish I was dead. So I wouldn't wish that upon myself. Look, I I'm just going to think about it.
[12 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[12 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Can I think about it for a day or two?
[12 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : You're not locked into anything. That's all we can.
[12 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : And no.
[12 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Let's leave everything as is with your current policy.
[12 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK, alrighty. I'll do that.
[12 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Did you want us to they're going to call back or do you want or just leave everything as is and when you want to call back to let us know? Yeah. OK.

[12 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : The next payment will be $32.90 and that's scheduled to be debit on the 13th of March. That's all correct.
[12 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Umm am I am I able to just cap that and not let it get up any higher? I know that, that I know the amount that's paid out goes up in the increments for, you know, for what the cost of living is of this day, but can I just tap it and not, not go any further?
[12 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Well, there's two reasons.
[13 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[13 minutes][Agent] : You the the premiums go up, the once an age base increase, OK.
[13 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Mm.
[13 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : The other reason is your benefit amount goes up, you can decline that.
[13 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[13 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So your benefit aren't just stays the same, your premiums don't go up as much. Do you want to do that?
[13 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep. And yeah. Mm, Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Mm hmm.
[13 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK. So if you want to California, yes, So the premium, so it will go from $32.90 to on the renewal which is the 1st of April to just stay at $32.90 and your benefit aren't just stay the same. OK.
