So it really depends on how many days actually, umm, and how many weeks that month has. So it's some, some of the months they have 4 weeks and some of the months they have 5 weeks.

[11 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : That's OK.
[11 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so if you add accidental serious injury for you as well as your husband, it will be an extra $4.07 a fortnight. So currently you're paying $29.80.
[11 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Uh, the new fortnightly premium would be $33.87.
[11 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So the accidental serious injury is triple the amount. So if you want to go ahead with that, I'll have just have to read some details regarding that.
[11 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So do you want to go ahead with that?
[11 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes. Yep. I'll do that.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, so the accident and do you want to know regarding your benefit, like do you want to know any product specifics or just for the accident serious injury, I can read it to you or do you want me to read it for the whole policy? Whole policy that's fine Yep sure not a problem. So umm, may I confirm that that umm, you are a female Australian resident?
[12 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Maybe just check the whole policy because I haven't I haven't rang for a long time and just make sure everything's up to date, yes.
[12 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, so Joanne, uh, your final expenses insurance cover provides your family members with a cash benefit of up to $15,000 in the event that you pass away. It can be used not only for funeral expenses, but also any other, uh, final expenses like unpaid bills. If that was due to an accident, the benefit amount is triple. You currently have umm $8145.00 off benefit amount and that's for you as well As for dairy. Umm and then umm just going to check. OK, so you umm factor and get you to the policy will insure for the same amount as well as he's insured. You will be paying umm $33.87 for for tonight. Umm, so $4.07 on top of what you're paying for the accidental serious injury. Umm, I do need to let you know that for the 1st 12 months, umm yeah, covered for excellent. OK, so that one won't apply because you have taken the policy from 2011. Included in your cover is a cash out benefit, which means once the oldest person covered under the policy turns 85, you have the option to cancel your policy and receive a cash out benefit of 50% of the funeral insurance benefit a month for one life insured.
[13 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep, OK.
[14 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Umm, you also have a sum insured bonus. Once the oldest person covered under the policy turns 90, premiums are no longer payable and you will also receive a 25% sum insured bonus on the funeral insurance benefit amount at no additional cost to you from the age of 90. If you opt to cancel your cover and receive the cash or benefit, it will be 50% off your increased funeral insurance benefit amount for One Life insured.
[14 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : None.
[14 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Umm OK so I do need to advise you that there is an exclusion on this policy. For the 1st 12 months you are covered against accidental death. Only after 12 months if cover it covers due that due to any cost including an accident. This applies to the increase amount. So we are not increasing the amount, but we are just adding the accidental serious injury. So accidental serious injury cover provides a lump sum payment to help cover costs if you were seriously injured in an accident but did not pass away. Specifically, this option covers quadriplegia, paraplegia, hemiplegia, blindness, deafness, or total and permanent loss of use of two limbs. The benefit amount is equal to three times the final expenses benefit amount, and we'll cover you until the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday. Umm, So for $24,435, that's the accidental serious injury, umm, plus the benefit amount you'll be paying $33.87. Umm, so $4.07 on top of $29.80 to complete this request. Umm, your new benefit amount will be. So currently you have benefit amount of $8145.00. Umm, accidental serious injury is $24,435.00. So that's for you as well.
[16 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[16 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : As for Gary, Yep. So your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as your age. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation which means each year your benefit amount will increase by 5% with associated increase in premium. You can opt out of this indexation each year. We will let you know in advance of any changes to your benefit amount and premium. So do you have any questions before we finalize this? No. No.
[16 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : No so the fu the funeral bene funeral insurance benefits 8000, accidental bene death benefits 16,000 and the ACT tax.
[17 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So accidental death benefit is also similar to excuse me, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[17 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : You're right, you're right.
[17 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Accidental serious injury and accidental death benefit are the same? Yes. So it's triple the amount. So what you are saying accidental death benefit, it's that amount plus your benefit amount. So which equals to triple. So both are $24,435.
[17 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Alright, alright. Because the statement that I've got is only 16.
[17 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, plus plus the benefit amount.
