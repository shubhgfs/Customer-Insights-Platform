[1 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, All right, so I'll save that. All right, it won't be too long. All right, so I can have a better understanding of why you're looking into funeral insurance today. Are you new to it or you currently have, you know, some cover in place? Yeah.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : We don't have anything and we're getting older, so that's why.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK. No, that's definitely fair enough. Yeah.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : That's the reason.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's the reason.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Alright, what I'll do, I'll explain the main features and benefits and run through some options with you. OK, so our cover is designed to provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to your loved ones when you pass away. They can use the funds not only for funeral expenses but also other final expenses like unpaid bills. You can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this benefit amount. And if death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple OK.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[2 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : In addition, before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, if you were to suffer an accidental serious injuries such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit amount will also triple.
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, it's easy to apply, there are no medical checks and acceptance is guaranteed if you're an Australian resident aged between 18 and 79.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Right. OK, Yeah.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so just so you know, for the 1st 12 months you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months you'll be covered for death due to any cause. In addition, there is a terminal ill illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with a 12 month or less to leave by medical practitioner, we will pay your claim in full to help you with things like medical expenses.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so you can choose between 3000 up to $15,000. And a couple of things to note, your premiums are level, which means they're designed to stay the same as you get older. And when you reach the age of 85, your premiums will cease. So you have nothing more to pay and you'll automatically, automatically receive a 25% bonus cover and this will be applied to your benefit amount. Any questions for me so far? No. OK, So your cover also provides you with an early cash out option. So anytime after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover and we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : No, no, right.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : This also applies applies to your partner if you do have a joint plan there. OK, so let's go through some pricing together. As I mentioned, level of cover ranges from 3000 up to 15,000. All right, you can get yourself covered or yeah, like Steven as well.
