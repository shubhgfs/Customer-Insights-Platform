So what I'll do for you is I'll explain the main features and benefits and just run through some pricing with you as well, just to explain kind of what you know what comes with the price uh today yes. So what I cover is designed uh to provide for yourself for this. It's designed to provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to your loved ones when you pass away, so they can use the funds not only for funeral expenses, but also any other final expenses like unpaid bills as well. Now, is there anyone that you're wanting to, you know, provide that financial protection for or anyone in mind that you might want to be nominated as a beneficiary? Your wife?

[2 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : You can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive their nominated benefit amount. And if death is due to an accident, what your chosen benefit amount will actually triple. So that's just built in part of the policy. In addition as well, before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, if you were to suffer an accidental serious injuries such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit amount will also triple for yourself.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Right.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that's all.

[3 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : We don't send you that to the doctors to get blood tests or anything like that. As long as you're an Australian resident aged between 40 and 79, acceptance is guaranteed, which you've already covered.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : So you're already accepted for the cover Rd. It's just about finding the right cover for yourself and your wife as well. Yeah.

[3 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : And just so you know, for the 1st 12 months, you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury early. After the first 12 months, you'll be covered for death due to any cause. And in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit that's included in the cover as well, which means after holding the policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or left to live by a medical practitioner and that unfortunate instance, what we do, payout the claim to you in full to help with things like medical expenses and to just plan out for the future with your loved ones as well. Yeah.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So how's that sounding to you so far, the whole cover itself?
[3 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah, that sounds, sounds reasonable. Yeah.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And did you have any questions for me so far at this stage?
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I'm, I'm I've only just started investigating. So this is still just an investigating sort of enquiry so we can get ahead around.
[4 minutes][Agent] : I know that's a lot of information already yeah fair enough yeah of course OK no no no one no worries.
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : So Yep, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for letting me know the way that you're still shopping at the market as well umm with our cover here right, you can choose between $3000 up to $50,000 and a couple of things tonight as well in regards to this premiums you can uh your premium is level. So what that means is it's designed to stay the same as you get older. There are no yearly increases or anything like that. And when you reach the age of 85, a couple of things happen out to your premiums. I know that's still, you know, quite a few years to go for yourself. But when you reach the age of 85, your premiums will cease. So you'll have nothing more to pay.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : You still remain covered. And you also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover on top of your benefit amount as well.

[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So that's applied to your benefit amount.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So for example, let's say you took a $10,000 policy. When you reach the age of 85, umm, you'll receive an additional 25% of bonus cover, which will bring it up to 12. Uh, 12,500. Yeah, awesome. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website if you were curious about it.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Great.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Awesome and along with that with turning 85 as well, that is a big milestone as well. So uh, what you cover also provides you is an early cash out option. So at any time after you reach 885 years of age, you can choose to end your cover and we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. So that might come in handy.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, sure.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : That's just an option for yourself, of course, at that stage, but in case you find yourself in a, you know, a tough situation could come in handy for a rainy day sort of thing, you know?
