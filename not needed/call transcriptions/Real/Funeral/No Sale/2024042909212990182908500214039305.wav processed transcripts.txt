[3 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : What was that again?
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Oh, sorry Raven. Umm, so just so I can have a better understanding of why you're looking into funeral insurance today. Uh, are you new to it or do you currently have some cover in place?
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : My my colour.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : No worries. Alright, well what I'll do is explain the main features and benefits and run through some options with you. So Raymond, our company is designed to provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to your loved ones when you pass away. They can use the funds not only for funeral expenses but also any other final expenses like unpaid bills. You can nominate up to five beneficiaries to receive this benefit amount and if death is due to an accident, your chosen benefit will triple. In addition, before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, if you were to suffer an accidental serious injuries such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit amount will will also triple. It's easy to apply, there are no medical checks and acceptance is guaranteed if you're an Australian resident aged between 18 and 79. Just so you know, for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months you'll be covered for death due to any cause.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less, uh, or or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay your claim in full to help with those things like medical expenses. So Raymond, uh, you could choose between $3000 up to $15,000. And a couple of things to note, your premiums are level, which means they are designed to stay the same as you get older. And when you reach the age of 85, your premiums will cease. So you have nothing more to pay and you Al and you will also automatically receive a 25 percent bonus cover. This will be applied to your benefit amount. Do you have any questions for me so far?
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : It's not not too young.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : No worries, love it, love it. OK Betty, your cover also provides you with an early cash out option. So anytime a after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. This also applies to your partner if you have a joint plan. So let's go through some pricing together. As I mentioned, the level of cover ranges from $3000 up to $15,000 and you can get cover just for yourself or you and your partner. So WH what benefit amount would you like me to look at? 1st 15? OK, let's have a look at that one. So just remember the the value for accidental serious injury is also adjusted and it's three times the base amount.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : 15 Yeah, this is a joint thing between me and 15H.

We will umm, send you out a free wheel kit value that's $30 E uh, with each policy. So for that one, like explained, I was the real reward after the first pre the anniversary of your first policy premium, you'll get back $295.46 for you to spend on whatever you like.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : What's dear house insurance to be kids? We've got a house insurance. It's 300,000.
[9 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : That's so how's, how's that sounding so far? Did you want me to look at some other quotes for you?
[9 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Well, it'll be good if it is about 50.
[10 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So just remember the accidental serious injury and accidental accidental serious injury and accidental death will triple to $45,000 each.
[10 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[10 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So if you were to die unfortunately in an in an accident in the 1st 12 months your the 15,000 will triple to 45,000 12,000 each so. So for $12,000 each it comes to $90.91 per fortnight with a real reward of $236.37.
[11 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[11 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So how does how's that sounding in terms of suitability?
[11 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Oh, it's sounding alright.
[11 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK. That's no rush.
[11 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : I can you just give us a bit of time to think about it.
[11 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's OK. That's fine.
[11 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Just want to get a few other points, that's all.

[11 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Just yeah, I'm running pensioner so.
[11 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So umm, you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the PO policy than the benefit amount. Please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside the 30 days, your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back unless you are eligible and choose the early cash back offer. So, so the 12,000 each. How, how does that sound so far? Because what I could do is what I could do for you is get you immediately covered over the phone today. I can send you out all the policy documents to review. This policy gives you a 30 day cooling off. So if you decide this policy is not suitable for for either of you and cancel within the 30 days, then you'll receive a full refund of your premium unless a claim has been made.
