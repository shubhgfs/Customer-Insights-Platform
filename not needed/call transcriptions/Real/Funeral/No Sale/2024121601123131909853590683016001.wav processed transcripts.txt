[34 seconds][Agent] : Any backup number at all or just the mobile and the address? I've got Unit 2 at 16 Taylor Court, Caboolture, QLD 4510 and e-mail mped73@outlook.com.
[49 seconds][Customer] : Yes, thank you.

[55 seconds][Customer] : No. Raining. Raining. Raining.
[57 seconds][Agent] : Oh, really?
[57 seconds][Customer] : Windy.
[58 seconds][Agent] : Oh, goodness. I can. Oh, really? OK. Oh, you'll be sick of mine now.
[59 seconds][Customer] : It's been raining for about four days yes.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : There, I thought that Queensland was always fine. Fine and sunny. Not every day, no. OK, fair enough. Oh, really? OK. Oh, that makes. Yeah. OK, fair enough. Now me can understand you're looking at putting a stop for the funeral insurance policy at home with us.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : At night it's No, it's the wet season in QLD Yeah.
[1 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Oh goodness.
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : I'm unemployed at the moment and I found a cheaper, better deal at the moment, yes. I'm just trying to cut my costs and everything, yeah.
[1 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, I understand. Understand. Sorry to hear. Look, in order to get things finalised, all we require is a simple letter in writing. But obviously you've been a valued member with us for a couple of years. Me, you know, we want to help out if we can. So it's just a short term thing while you're getting yourself into a new job. Is that right?
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Well, yeah, sort of. Well, yeah, Trying to cut costs, obviously all the time because that's the cost of living.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : MMM, No, on this day and age, we're all trying to, aren't we?
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : But uh, yeah, I mean, I understand. Like obviously if things getting a bit tough while you're, while you're off work, umm, do you have any time frame on when you'll be getting back to work? That's a little bit of how long is a piece of string, isn't it?
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : You'll be back in the new year at some stage.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Well, I don't know.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : I don't know if I would be going back to work. So I've got illnesses, that's the problem. Yeah. So.
[2 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Oh, goodness. OK, Understand. Understand. Well, look, obviously we wanna help out if we can, Megan. And if it's just a matter of getting through the the next few months, we can certainly help out. Obviously, it sounds like there's the possibility that things may go a little longer than that, but hopefully you get some good news and you're back up and running sooner rather than later.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Oh.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Because if the policy is normally affordable for you, I see it's what are we, $14.82 per fortnight? If that's normally affordable for you while you're working and it's just why you've got some time off due to the ill health, what we could do is actually waive the premiums for a few months to give you some respite. Basically what that means is you're still covered for the next three months. You don't just don't have to worry about premiums for three months. So it'll get you through till close to the end of March. And as I say, hopefully by that stage you've got some light at the end of the tunnel. I mean, if you have well and good, the policy just carries on regardless. Of course, if things are still tough in three months time, you can always let us know and we'll see if there's anything else we can do. But obviously you've been a been a valued member with us for some time. Mary, Megan, sorry. And we want to help out if we can. If it'd help out to give you a few months of not having to worry about the premiums, we'd be happy to help out.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Oh OK then, Well the other question is I'm looking at being covered for $10,000. How much would the premium be if I went up 'cause I know mine is 7 1/2 at the moment isn't it?
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, currently seven and a half, $1000. Let me just cover off some policy information and then we'll look at the premium. Let me. So as it stands, obviously you're, we, you've got our real funeral cover at 7 and a half, $1000. So the policy provides you landlines with that cash benefit if you pass away.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Oh.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : And of course, if death was due to an accident, the benefit amount triples. In addition, you've got accidental serious injury cover on here. So if you were to suffer an accidental serious injury before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, such as quadriplegia or paraplegia, the benefit amount will also be tripled. So yeah, triple payout for accidental serious injuries as well. You also have a terminal illness advance payment, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were provided a first diagnosis of 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, you can claim your full benefit as a living benefit.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Once you reach the age of 85, your premiums will cease and we will automatically add a 25% bonus cover to your benefit amount. And then once you reach the age of 100, your cover will end and we will pay you both the funeral insurance benefit amount in force immediately prior to your 85th birthday and the 25% bonus cover. This policy also provides you with an only cash out option. At any time After you reach 85 years of age, you may elect to enter cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Now of course with these policies there is that 12 month waiting period. For the 1st 12 months you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause. So of course you've already served that waiting period. So that's all taken care of on your policy. But it would apply to an increase just so you're aware.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So the, the waiting period would apply to an increase in cover, but in the original cover's obviously all taken care of. OK. And then you were looking at $10,000, is that right?
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Oh, now we might not be able to top up this one. This one may need to actually, yes, I think let me just double check with this policy, we don't, we have the option to top it up. You can take in a a new cover for for a top up amount, but let me just confirm. Yeah. So, yeah, we can't increase the benefit amount on an existing policy, but you can keep your existing policy, of course, and you can take out an additional cover to top it up if you chose to. The only trick there is, of course, the minimum is $3000. So it's from three up to $15,000.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : And so that would actually put you at 10 1/2, but $3000 cover would be, oh, one second. It's trying to, oh, I see. My apologies, Megan, it's trying to make your policy go to $3000 and we don't want that.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : I'm gonna get nothing for $3000 these days.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Let me just see if the system won't let me do it quite for you. The other way, $3000 swap cover would come in at $6.46 per fortnight, so that'd give you 10 1/2 or 646 for us.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : That's $20.31.
[7 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : I'm just jumping back to make sure I give you a little rough figure. Oh goodness. Come on computer. My apologies, Megan, I've just pushed the wrong button and now it's going to have a big long think before it lets me push the right one.
[8 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : No, that's wrong.
[8 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that's made. That took far longer than that shut off. So your original cover is $14.82, so that would be a total of 2128. But bear in mind, of course, you've only got three $3000 worth waiting period. The rest of it's all got the waiting period changed.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course we can put it on. Yep. Well, yeah, we'll give you some response while you're getting yourself back on your feet. That's no problem at all.
[8 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Well, what I might do is well do that first suggestion that you said if that's possible the for month waiting bill while you look for work, that's wonderful.
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : And at the end of the three month period, you'll get a reminder notice to let you know what's happening. Of course things are due to pick up. If you're in a better spot at that stage, great, well and good, you don't need to do a thing. But of course, running a phone call away if things are still tough. Now, I do need to just run through a little bit of information with you. We've done sort of covered it freely briefly, but just a little bit more detailed information on what we're doing. I'm just checking here. The next payment is scheduled to come out later this week. Oh, that's not until Friday now.
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : We'll have plenty of time to get things sorted out at our end before then. So Megan, based on what you've explained to me, I'd like to let you know that in accordance with the Life Insurance Code of Practice, real insurance has a hardship provision. This is to help customers who are suffering significant financial difficulty due to an unforeseen of E where they expect it to be resolved in the near future. Based on this description, would you agree that you are suffering temporary financial hardship?
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what I can do is assist you by waiving your premiums for three months from the 19th of December being the date your premiums were last paid up to. During this time you will not need to pay any premiums and your cover will remain in force without any restrictions. This is a once off premium waiver. Megan, can I please confirm you understand and agree to keep your policy in place by accepting this once off premium waiver and agree for your payments to resume on the 28th of March for 1482 on a fortnightly basis?
[10 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : How long do I have to keep the premium in place after the hold comes off? Like how long do I have to?
[10 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : There's no restrictions.
[10 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK then. Yeah. Alright then. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Yeah.
[10 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, there's OK.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Thank you. Because I thought like six months.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Oh, sorry, just a clear yes or no for the reporting.
[10 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Excellent.
[10 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, thank you.
[10 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Sorry, did you have a question?
[10 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. No, no. Like if I changed like a month later or something.
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. Yeah, no, you're not locked into anything.
[10 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't restricted to keep this policy for a long term. Oh, OK. Or cancel or something.
[11 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, if you want to increase once you or add to the cover all after your after that Porsche.
[11 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[11 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Or exactly if things are still tough, if that's what it. Yeah, obviously that's still an option if need be.
[11 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, thank you. Yes.
[11 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So I mean, obviously, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let us know if things are still grim and we'll see if there's anything else we can do to help out. But yeah, you've been a valued member with us for several years, so I'm glad there's a a little bit of help we can offer. But yeah, that's all taken care of. Megan, we'll get a letter out to you to confirm what we've discussed today, and you'll also get a reminder letter about a month before it's due to pick up again. So around about the end of February, you should receive a letter from us early March just to remind you that things are picking up at the end of March. And yeah, as I say, if things are still tough at that stage, let us know. Otherwise, it'll all look after itself.
[11 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Oh, wonderful. Thank you so much for your help.
[11 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Good.
[11 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Enjoy your day and have a wonderful Christmas.
[11 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Thank you very much for your time and your patience, Megan. And same to you. All the best.
[11 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[11 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Take care. Bye. Bye.
[11 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Thank you. Bye.
