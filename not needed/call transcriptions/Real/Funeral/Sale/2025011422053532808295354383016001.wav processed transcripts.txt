[57 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Just so I can put you because you've come through to our sales team. So just so I can put you through to the right place, what were you looking at doing there, Mark? Yeah, I can help.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Mate, I'm looking at the the cost of just having funeral cover because I'm paying $164 a fortnight and I'm on a pension and I, I just, it's just killing me mate, literally.
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. No, no, of course. It's always good to review everything. Have you, have you had it in place for a long time? I can have a look since 2012.
[1 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : And I've, I've paid basically I've paid 27 grand and my health is alright.
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So it's been a while, Yeah.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : And I've been talking to my son about it and he's made, he's financially very well off.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it'll make a difference in terms of saving you. Yeah. Yeah. Now what?
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : And he just said, look, Dad, I'm just happy if you just paid for the, the funeral and just, you know, stick your money, stick your money in the Super account there because he said you've spent 27 grand and, and I'm, I'm, yeah, mate, I'm paying $164.00 out of my pension a fortnight.
[2 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : What I'll do, Mark, is I'll take you through how the funeral cover works and I'll give you a price. Umm, if it sounds suitable and more affordable, you can just let me know.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : But umm with our funeral cover so there are no medical checks required. Just the way it works is for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Only after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any causes. Both. You know, The thing is if your, if your death is due to an accident, mark, whatever your chosen benefit is, it will triple. OK. Now there's also a terminal illness benefit with the funeral cover. So after holding a policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with the terminal illness with 12 months for us to live by a medical practitioner, we can pay out your funeral cover earlier. So you can choose from 3000 to $15,000 of cover mark for the funeral.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : It does depend if you're looking at a cremation or a burial. Do you know how much cover you'd be looking at or what type of funeral you'd be looking at?
[3 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Oh mate, I'll I'll have I'll be having a cremation and I'll be looking at 15.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. So I'll give you a quote for 15. If you need me to go lower, you can just let me know.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So, OK, so at the moment that if you're looking at the maximum funeral cover available, in terms of pricing, you'd be looking at $48.08 per fortnight. Yep. The main, yeah, the main difference. I was just gonna say the main difference as well with the life insurance and the funeral cover is with the funeral cover, you don't have to worry about your price going up every year with your age because your premiums are designed to stay the same as you get older.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : 48 Fortnite and and of course, sorry, go on, right.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So to check in with you though, Mark, how is that sounding compared to the life insurance so far?
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Pull a beat the hell out of 164.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, saves you $100 pretty much.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : It's yeah. And that and that gives me 15,000, right?
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Because what I, Yeah. So the way it works generally with our funeral claims, as soon as we've received the documents from your son, it's paid out within 24 to 48 hours.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So that gives me $15,000 cover and that's that's made access accessible to my son when I die, basically stayed away in that right.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So that the with the payout as well. Obviously if the, if the cremation ends up costing a little bit less, whatever is leftover, that's for your son to keep.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : So the cost of the cremation comes out of the 15 grand.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Obviously he's got it. He pays, he pays that, you paying the 15 and he has to pay for everything basically.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So you can, well, yeah, we have, we have no say what happens with the 15th.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So you can use it to pay off the cremation final expenses, those sort of things. Because on, according to the government's Money smart website, Mark, umm, private funerals typically cost somewhere in the region of $4000 for a basic cremation. So whatever's leftover, that's for him to use them for all expenses. It's it's up to the family.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, yeah, sure. OK.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Of course, we have no say, but umm, there's a couple of extra features which I'll go through with you as well just to cover everything else. Umm, what happens when you reach 85 mark?
[6 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : What?
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Your premiums will seats, so you'll still be covered, but you don't have to pay anymore and you automatically receive a 25% bonus cover on top of your $15,000.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : What?
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, we did give you the option if you want to cash out your policy early. So any time after you've reached the age of 35, you can choose to end your cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Now just just to check in with you though, do you have any questions around the funeral cover or pretty straightforward there.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : No, no, that's pretty straightforward, mate.
[7 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Now with your in terms of what you wanna do, Mark. So if the life insurance isn't affordable anymore or if it's a bit out of the budget and the funeral cover meets your needs more so, we can try to cancel the life insurance and replace it with the funeral cover.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. Yeah, alright, alright.
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So I can see your your usual payments are scheduled for the 27th of Jan. So if it helps out, you can still get the funeral cover in place today and receive your full documents to go through. The life insurance would then be canceled and then you can have your first payment come out when your life insurance is going to.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : So my first, I can change it and my next payment will be only $48.
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Exactly right.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Alright, well, let's let's do that because I've got to. I've just got to do that, mate, because it's just.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah. That's good that you're reviewing your options because especially like you said, as you're getting older and you're on a pension, it's a bit hard to keep up with those payments.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yes. Yep.

So you are approved and you have reviewed this policy in full. So may not be identical to your existing cover. You should also consider the benefits that may not apply or waiting here. It's the may start again.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. I know, Matthew, I know.
[9 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Now, of course, as you're aware, this is an insurance policy, so you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy from the percent amount and just sorry, sorry, but I know, I know, you know, I know you're aware, but I just as part of the compliance, Sorry, I just had to.
