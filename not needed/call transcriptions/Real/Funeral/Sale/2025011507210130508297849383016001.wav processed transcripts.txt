[1 seconds][Customer] : Hello, Vicky. Speaking.
[3 seconds][Agent] : Good afternoon. It's showing calling from real Insurance giving you a call in regards to an online expression of interest that was made in regards to some funeral insurance. How you going?
[13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, good. Thank you.
[15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, good. Thanks. So the reason for my call is because you've made that expression of interest online. It's to go through the main features and benefits of our funeral policy, run through what's covered, as well as some pricing with you.
[14 seconds][Customer] : And yeah, yeah, sure.
[26 seconds][Agent] : While I have you on the phone now, I will let you know that all the calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is genuine in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. Now, for security purposes and to confirm I've got the correct details here, I'll confirm I am speaking to Vicky Singh.
[43 seconds][Customer] : Yep, correct.
[43 seconds][Agent] : And Vicky, we've got your date and your first name spelled Vickie Perfect and Singh SING.
[52 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[54 seconds][Agent] : So that was all correct, perfect.
[56 seconds][Customer] : Yes, correct. Sure I am.
[57 seconds][Agent] : And your date of birth the 15th of November 1969 and you are a female Australian resident, Perfect. So Vicky, I can see here when you might be inquiring online here, you were looking at $13,000 cover.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Uh, now you do have the option to choose the level of cover, anywhere from $3000 up to $15,000 cover. We can definitely start with the 13,000 and we can have a look at different amounts if that was something you're interested in as well.
[1 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm. Yes, Sir.
[1 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Now, umm, with the, uh, with the funeral insurance, what it is designed to do, it is designed to provide a cash benefit to your loved ones if you were to pass away. And, uh, they can use those funds, umm, not only for, uh, funeral expenses, but also any expenses there might be at that time. So, umm, we don't stipulate how they are to use those funds. We do provide that to them as a cash benefit.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : And, uh, we do, uh, generally have claims paid within 24 to 48 business hours of us receiving all the necessary documentation.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Umm, now you can nominate up to five beneficiaries, uh, who you'd like to receive, uh, those funds there. Uh, you can even nominate how much you'd like each one to receive.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : And if you would have passed away and your death was due to an accident, that chosen benefit amount will actually triple in that instance, OK. So, uh, for example, if you had the $13,000 cover and you would have passed away and your death was due to an accident, your beneficiaries would receive $39,000. OK, now it is easy to apply. There's no medical checks. We don't ask you any health questions.
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : As long as you are an Australian resident and, and you are aged between 40 and 79, which you are, acceptance is guaranteed there for you.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm. Yep.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, now for the $13,000 cover, you're looking at a fortnight in premium there, Vicki of $31.78. That's per fortnight.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : How's that sounding there for you?
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that sounds pretty good.
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, now I will let you know that for the 1st 12 months speaking, you will be covered for accidental deaths and accidental serious injury.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Only after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause whatsoever.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep. OK.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Now in addition to that, there is also a terminal illness benefit including the company. Hopefully this is something you won't even need to use, but it is there for you nonetheless. What that means is after holding your policy for 12 months, if you if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, we will actually pay that claim to you in full while you're still alive and you can use those funds to assist you with any medical expenses you might have at that time.
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. OK.
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, now how's that $13,000 cover sounding with that fortnightly premium of $31.78 in terms of suitability and affordability for you?
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think that sounds OK.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Can you tell me how much? Like if I did if then like, my mum's just passed away.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry to hear that. Yeah. So you don't want to leave them with that burden?
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So that's what's making me think I wanna get this organised for my kids, yeah.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK. Well, $15,000 cover for yourself would be a fortnightly premium of $36.67 per fortnight.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : OK, now. So does that like increase each year?
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : No. So your premiums, they are designed to stay the same as you get older.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So with the uh, with the premiums, umm, they will only change uh, if you make changes to your policy or if the insurer adjusts the premium rates. But the insurer can only make adjustments if they make, uh, adjustments to all, umm, to all real funeral policy holders. Since we've had this product in place, which is nearly five years, there has been no premium changes.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, so as I said, the premiums are designed to stay the same as you get older.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : And then when you reach the age of 85, your premiums will actually stop. So you'll have no more premiums left to pay. The policy will actually still remain in place and will actually cover you at no additional cost to yourself until you turn 100. And once you reach 85, you'll also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover and that will be applied to your benefit amount. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[5 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Now, how's that $15,000 cover sounding? Is that sounding like something you'd be more interested in?
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think it probably would be.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, now bear in mind too, Vicky, that time, if you were happy, let's say that to, I mean, I just get something in place. Let's say you started with the $15,000 cover and then down the track, your circumstances change. You wanted to either decrease the level of cover or vice versa. You want to start off with something lower and then you wanted to, umm, apply for additional cover. You can apply to do so. That would just be subject to eligibility at the time.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep. OK.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, now mm. Hmm.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So with the 12 months like the thing, so if if like because I travel to work every day. So if so I had an accident and passed away, is it in that 12 months that would that be covered if it was an accident? Yeah, OK.
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yes, so, so, so, so accidental death is you are covered that triple the benefit amount that applies to the whole like while you've got the policy in, in in place, OK, but for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. So just an example, if you have $15,000 cover and you would have set the policy up, umm, let's say today and in a month's time you were, you know, hopefully that's not something that does happen. But umm, if you were to pass away and your death was due to an accident, with $15,000 cover, your beneficiaries would receive $45,000.
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK? Now included in this policy as well is what we call a real reward. And what this means is following your first policy anniversary day to be here, we will actually refund you 10% of the premiums you've paid in that time. And with the $15,000 cover that we would be $95.34.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now the policy does also provide you with another option once you reach 85 and that's what we call an early cash out option. So with any time after you reach 85 years of age, you can actually choose to end your cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, now, so how is that $15,000 cover sounding like something you'd be more leaning towards at this stage?
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think so.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And so, so sorry to hear about the recent loss of your, your mom as well. Was it was that sudden or was was she? She was not. Oh, OK.
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no, she was she was 90 and she had she had dementia for quite a few years, but she got influenza.
[7 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK.
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : And yeah, that was sort of the the catalyst.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So yeah.
[8 minutes][Agent] : Well, and I, yeah, it's, it's still not easy. It doesn't matter how old they are or what.
[8 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, exactly. And yeah.
[8 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : I lost my father three years ago and it's still hard, but, yeah, it's very hard.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : And because he had a funeral policy, you know, it was a lot easier.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that was. That's great. Great to know. Yeah. Hmm. Mm.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Hers was. They say it was an insurance line.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : But you found that that was that was that that relieved a bit of the burden there?
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : I think it was called, but I know my yeah, I did, I did.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yes, yeah. OK. Well, what I'll do is if I can just confirm your residential address, Vicky, just starting with your post code and suburb there if I can.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm. Yeah. And the address there. Yeah. And where, where abouts is that? Where abouts is Manila is that?
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : So Post Code's 2346 and it's Manila Mani Double LA 65, Kanangra KANANGR A. So it's, have you heard of Tamworth?
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yes, yes.
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So we're about half an hour north of Tamworth.
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK. And that's also your postal address as well. OK, perfect. And we've got a mobile number here ending in 420 as the best contact number.
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that's it.

Now, umm, I will let you know as well that included in the umm policy is also a umm, you we do also provide you with the free online legal will OK, and that's started at $160.00.

Should you need assistance in getting that in place. And that's something if you're not making that you can on forward that to anyone else that you don't like to give that to. OK, now you may pay more in total premiums over the life of a policy than the benefit amount. Please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you can't go outside of the 30 days you'll cover will stop and you will not receive anything back unless you are eligible for and choose the only cash back offer.
