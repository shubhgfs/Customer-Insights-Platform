[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Alright son, same address. OK, OK, 4 Barber St. OK, I'm just adding null there as well. Alright, so with we OK, so it the amount has to equal 100% in total now because it depends on whether you want equal distribution. The best that I can do it if you want close to equal 1 would have to get 33.34% and the other two would have to get 33.33%. So one of them will get that extra 01 percent.
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, I'll probably get my my eldest child to get the extra.
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : That's the only which is Seamus. OK, it's only .01% anyway.
[6 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. You sold that up to the 100%.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So 33.34, Francesca 33.33 and Knoll Yep, 33.33 Yep, that all equals out to 100%. Just updating, and I can confirm now on this call recording that that your three children are your beneficiary on your old policy. And now I'm also going to go into the new one that you just set up and you want them to be the beneficiary for that as well, Is that correct? Alright, beautiful. I'm going to set that. I'm going to set that up too. It's already in the system, so it'll be easy to Add all of them in there.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yeah.
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So, Seamus, yeah, no, it's fine. Better late than never, as they say So.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : No, I need to try and do this year, yeah.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So you've done the right thing. Alright, Irene, I'm just adding him up and same thing. Seamus 33.34 Thanks. Francesca 33.3% and null 33.33% adding that in there and dating and I can confirm on the new policy as well. Your three children are your beneficiary. Now you'll get updated policy schedules for both of them individually sent out to you Irene, which will show you beneficiaries now listed. Now with the new policy, you will more than likely get your original documents and it will not go beneficiaries. Don't worry, a a few days later you'll get an amended policy schedule and that's the only page you have to swap out. It's all done now for you, for both policies.
