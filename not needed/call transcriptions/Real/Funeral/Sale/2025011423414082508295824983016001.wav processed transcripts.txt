[1 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[3 seconds][Agent] : Hi Philip, that's guy he's calling from Real Insurance. How are you going today, man?
[6 seconds][Customer] : Thank you, Brad. How are you?
[8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, not too bad as well. Thanks for asking that. So I've just received an enquiry online from you today for some funeral insurance cover.
[15 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[15 seconds][Agent] : So I wanted to run you through. Yeah, perfect. I just wanted to help you with the pricing and we'll have a chat about what the cover does for you and how it pays out and any questions, I'm happy to stop for you.
[26 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yep. Right.
[26 seconds][Agent] : Let me know, OK, I'll do a few checks and then we'll jump straight in and have a look. So today our calls recorded. Any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation there.
[40 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[37 seconds][Agent] : And I do have Phillip, uh, with a double L and, and Dobbs DO double BS for your surname. Is that all correct?
[40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's correct. Yeah.
[46 seconds][Agent] : Thanks, Phil. And, uh, 27th of November 1950 for your birthday. So you're 74 at the moment.
[53 seconds][Customer] : That's correct. Yeah.
[54 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And you are a male Australian resident, of course.
[57 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I am. Yeah.
[58 seconds][Agent] : Thanks Phil. And just so I can understand how to best help and explain this to you today, mate.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : No, no, this is my first application. Yeah.
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Are you new to funeral insurance or have you had it once before or first time? OK. And you just thought it was about time to get something in place in case the unexpected happens or what?
[1 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's that's about it.
[1 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Was there something that prompted it or Yeah.
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : I want to leave my fiancee covered for that cost difference if it is required. Yeah.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yep. I completely understand, man. That's fine. All good. Umm. So with our funeral insurance, it's designed to provide a cash benefit so that you're able to leave the money as a lump sum in full to the person or people of your choice when you pass away.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : That's great.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and we call them beneficiaries. As you probably already know, you can choose up to five with us, uh, at one time. And that's just in case you wanted to leave an, uh, percentage to more than one person so they can all play a part. If you are comfortable with just picking 1:00, that's fine as well. They'll just get the whole amount.
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So you get to decide that after you take the policy, umm, and if they use like most of it, like let's say they use a big chunk of the benefit you leave to them on the funeral and there's some money leftover, whatever's leftover they can still spend in any other way they need to.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Fine. It's OK.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, with, that's complete for him with it and, umm, the benefits, we'll just go through those now. So you're gonna get them all. I'll just give you an example on each. So that makes sense. So the first one is accidental death. This could be something as simple as a fault or a car accident bill.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : If you pass away within 90 days of the accident 1st occurring, it will be a triple payout. So if you had a $15,000 cover it'd then be a $45,000 payout for example.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : OK. OK. Let's move on here.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, now the accidental death benefit will begin immediately and it will stay in place the entirety of the policy, which is all the way up into the age of 100.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So that one doesn't expire until the cover finishes. All right, uh, the second benefit has a time frame on it. This one's called accidental series injury. So it's a living, living benefit for you to get the money. So in the event you were to suffer an accidental serious injury such as say cordyeplasia or paraplegia, for an example, the before the policy anniversary after your 75th birthday. So between now and then the benefit amount will also triple. In that regard. That triple amount will be coming to you.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So it can be used for things like medical costs, a carer or your bills and anything else.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah. Yeah.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, if, if that benefit is paid out like that while you're alive, Phil, your original funeral benefit you choose will still continue and remain in place, uh, until you pass away. So that way there's still something paid out for your funeral, which is the reason for the cover at the end of the day. Does that make sense?
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's true. Yeah.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Cool. So that's built in, umm, there's no medical checks either. Umm, we don't even need you to fill any forms in anything else. So it's a guaranteed acceptance so long as you're an Australian resident between age 40 and 79.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah, right.
[3 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Now in that regard, Phil, for the 1st 12 months, you will only be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury, which are the 1st 2 that we went through. Then after the first 12 months, you'll be then covered for death due to any cause from there moving forward. And that'll be more like your natural causes of death such as your heart as heart cancer, strokes, etcetera.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, just to be clear of that is because people that are already, I'll, they can get this covered too. Uh, but it doesn't mean somebody with, you know, a cancer diagnosis, for example, can take the cover and turn around two weeks after getting it and claim on. And that's what cause of death like cancer. So no matter who you are when you first get this, you have to serve that same way. Anybody encourage like everybody else.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : That's fine. Yeah.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, cool. There's also uh, I know illness is not a nice thing to talk about, but there is a terminal illness benefit on the cover too.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So after you have held your policy for the 1st 12 months, if by chance you were then first diagnosed with a terminal illness and a medical practitioner diagnosis you with 12 months or less to live, umm what you do mate is just call us yourself.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. Yeah.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Umm, at that time, you'll be able to claim yourself and we'll pay you out your entire funeral benefit while you're alive so you can receive that money early and do what you wish with it. So you might want to put it towards medical costs, but you probably might even want to tick off a bucket list with family and give them those memories. I always still can, but it's up to you.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK, now I'm going to get some pricing up and we'll go through that. Before I do that, is there any questions about the benefits we've gone through so far?
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No, that's pretty covers at all.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yep, cool.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : How are you going to reply by e-mail?
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Umm, well, we'll send you all the documents through e-mail and post, but we'll get you organized today if we can find you something simple, uh, and affordable of course. But, uh, I've got a little bit more to explain about the payments in the cover and what I just need to get the pricing up first. Does that make sense?
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yep cool. Umm, let's take our time with this part anyway because we can go between 3000 up to 15,000. You can go in the middle of that in five hundreds. I can check as many as you want. So you did put in for 14,000 online.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, Yeah, I I put 4000, but anyway.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Is that what you wanna check first 04? OK, must have been a mistake. Give me one SEC. So for $4000 of cover I can give you that and offer you that cover today, mate, for $27.47 a fortnight. So 27 decimal .47. And that's every two weeks, that is.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, yeah, and that'd be the direct debit, would it?
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we do direct debit. Yeah, it's nice and seamless. So you can either do a Visa or MasterCard or base pay an account number, whatever suits you better.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK then.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Do you want to look at any other amounts or would that be enough?
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that would be enough 'cause I'm just, I'm going to do a promotion actually.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah, that's fair. That's fair. I've only ever been through this once in my life. Feel I've been pretty lucky so far. I'm 32 so I'm still pretty young, but umm, my nan passing COVID and we didn't really have many options so we, we went with the cremation as well. And umm, well, we're lucky enough just to have 25 people then, you know what I mean? So it is what it is with that. But have you been through a few scenarios in your lifetime? You had to organize a few yourself or lucky enough not to.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, lucky enough not to at this stage.
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : That's good, man. Very lucky. You know, I, I didn't do it myself. My, my dad took care of everything. But I was there and I was seeing what was going on and what he had to do.
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, like, like I think why pick that? I inquired about your situation. My fiance has got a policy with you.
[7 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : And it's kind of prepared me a little bit, but OK, cool.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So, umm, that, well that's fine, that's pretty good. So you'll both have cover. Umm, we, in that regard, you might, she might have told you that, umm, the real reward following your first policy anniversary date, we actually give you, give you a refund. So we're going to refund you 10% of the premiums you've paid in that time. So thank you. So you'll get back $71.43 and you can go and spend that however you like.
[8 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK.
[8 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So it'll come back to you. Umm, we're going to send you a free online legal will from safe will as well.
[8 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Phil, if if you want to do a new Willow update 1, umm, they do cost $160.00 if someone wanted to buy one from say full, but we're going to provide you one for free.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK. It's good.
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So you'll get a separate e-mail from them within a day or two. Just follow the prompts.
[8 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but there will be a hard copy pamphlet with your paper documents if you wish to follow that when you're online as well.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, now there's a little bit more to the cover mate, and then I can get you organized if you're happy with everything.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Alright then.
[8 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So with the premiums, they are designed to stay the same as you get older with this cover only until you reach 85.
[8 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Now when you hit your 85th birthday, we're gonna do three things to your policy. So let's go through those. So the first thing is we're gonna stop your premiums, which means you don't have to pay an anything anymore.
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : After 85, I don't know.
[9 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : On your 85th birthday. Yeah.
[9 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So as soon as you hit 85, no more paying for this. Your cover will stay in place up into the age of 100.
[9 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[9 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So for for those 15 years, you'll still be covered. You just don't need to worry about the payments.
[9 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : The second thing we do when you turn 85 feels we'll give you a 25% bonus cover.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So that'll increase your cover to for you.
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Alright.
[9 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : And then what we wanna do and just have a think about what I explained to you earlier. So remember how accidental death is the first benefit and that stays in place the whole time. Umm, so if you had to suffer an accidental death between now and 85, it'll be 4000 * 3, right? Which is 12,000.
[9 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. Yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : But if you, uh, pass away between 85 and 100, then instead of 4000, is the 25% on top of 4000 what you've covered for in full, which would be 5000. So the extra $1000. So then it'll be a $15,000 payout if it's an accidental debt between 85 and 100. That's how that works.
[10 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, Alright.
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : If you make it to 100, I know that's rare, but the day before your 100th birthday, the cover finishes and you still get paid the benefit and the bonus cover yourself, which will be the 5000.
[10 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, good.
[10 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, now the third benefit is an optional 1. So what that realistically means is it's going to become available for you to ask for when you turn 85 years of age or over. Whether or not you ask for it is your choice. So it is the early cash out option.
[10 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Umm, you can choose to end your cover after you reach 85 years of age and we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit while you're living field. Umm, please just keep in mind for me mate, the bonus cover is not included with that, so you'll be taking a little bit less and what you're actually covered for if you keep it in place, but it's there in case you need to spare money at the end of the day.
[10 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, OK.
[11 minutes][Agent] : Don't forget you're not paying anymore for the policy once you reach 85 anyway, so if you keep it in place, you're covered for the 5000 in total.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : All right, and that's pretty much the gist mate. I've gone through everything. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website too. Regardless, anyway, and just as it is an insurance policy, you may, may, uh, you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. Uh, please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you're not receiving anything back unless you're eligible for interest that are the cash back offer, of course.
[11 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[11 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, Umm, just to let you know, uh, your options and what we can do. If you may, I can definitely send you a generic e-mail, umm, with the pricing without any cover, but alternatively, you're happy for everything, mate. We're more than happy to protect you now over the phone and give you that Peace of Mind.
[11 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[11 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Uh, for what we've talked about, we'll send you all the complete documentation through e-mail and post so you can go and review them in your own time.
[12 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : You want a postal address, I guess.
[12 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : We will provide you yeah I'll grab it off you in a SEC. If you're happy for this one umm, we're gonna give you a 30 day cooling off. With this option too mate.
[12 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : If you're happy for this one umm, The reason for that is it's gonna give you a bit of time to read for everything thoroughly and if it's not suitable after you've read everything, just call us back. If you cancel within those 30 days, we'll give you a full refund of the premium unless you make a claim in that time to be honest.
[12 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[12 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : But on top of that too mate, we don't need an upfront payment with this option. We allow you to choose when you want that to be and you don't need the back pay from today until the first payment day either. OK.
[12 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : O OK.
[12 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Are you happy to continue with being covered today for the 4000? Yep Yep, sorry. Do you have any other questions or?
[12 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yeah, not really.
