[2 seconds][Agent] : Hi, good morning, Christine. My name is DJ here calling from Real. And how you doing today, Matt?
[2 seconds][Customer] : Alright, I'm good. Thank you.
[9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, very good. Thank you for asking. Christine. I was just following up from that online inquiry that was made for us on our website there regarding some of our funeral insurance. So I'm here to take you through that pricing, but also happy to answer any questions about the coverage as well.
[8 seconds][Customer] : How are you? Thank you.
[23 seconds][Agent] : So I'll just quickly remind you, no, you're welcome. I'll just quickly remind you that our calls are recorded and media advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation.
[33 seconds][Customer] : That's fine.
[33 seconds][Agent] : And I'll just double, just double checking to make sure that your details have come through correctly as well. So I'm speaking with Christine Kern, is that correct?
[40 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[41 seconds][Agent] : And the date of birth, Christine, that is the 12th of September 1958.
[46 seconds][Customer] : That's right, that's correct. Yes.
[46 seconds][Agent] : And just confirming that you're an Australian resident, OK. And looking at the coverage you'd have seen on our website that the first range anywhere from the $3000 up to the $15,000. If you don't mind me asking, just to give me a bit of understanding of the inquiry today, what sparked and interest you want to take a look at this insurance for yourself, Christine?
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Just been considering life and finances as over the last few months and as a single woman, I don't have a lot of assets or a lot of money lying around. So I've been considering not lumping my son Lewis.
[1 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : That all makes sense. So you just want to pan here and just make sure there's no financial burden.
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : My funeral cost, Yeah, yes.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Therefore your sons have to cover these upfront cost when if that time does come. And then what we've just mentioned there that that's exactly what I like our funeral coverages to do with the day, Christine, it is there to ease that burden of your love watch. I'm happy to cover these costs. So for that purpose, our policy has been designed to be paid out nice and quickly. So once we do receive the relevant documentation to process a claim for funeral insurance, these funds generally get paid out within 24 to 48 business hours. So we just want to make sure that we can have that money paid out as quick as possible to your loved 1. So hopefully the financial side of things during this time is the last of their worries. And one of the benefits of actually organizing some funeral insurance at your age today compared to say where he later down the track when you rolled up is a premium that do work out to be cheaper.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yes, good. Yeah.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : And it's very simple to apply for as well. So there's no medicals or any blood tests to complete. But just so you know, for the 1st 12 months, you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. And after the first 12 months, you will be covered for death due to any cause. So once you've actually held the policy that's for 12 months, Christine, no matter how you pass away from that point onwards, you can rest assured that you'll be covered under this policy. But if Touchwood, if you passed away unexpectedly from an accident at any time off, you are covered under this policy.
[2 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : We do triple the benefit amount that you're insured for, OK?
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's very reasonable, Yeah. Mm hmm.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So if you come for the likes of say the $15,000, that's going to power the total of $45,000 to beneficiaries for accidental death.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK. Mm hmm.
[3 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now also for that extra peace in mind at no extra cost, in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit.
[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : This is something that we hope that you'll never have to use, but it just means that after holding your policy with us for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, then we can pay out the funeral insurance to you directly whilst you are still living and you can use that money. What is the cost that you may need to use that money for during that time?
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No, OK. That, well, that's really good. Thank you.
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's right. And a couple things to note with the policy also Christine is, uh, in terms of the premiums that you pay, umm, they are designed to stay the same.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, So you don't have to worry about them increasing every year as you're getting older, but umm, if you do wish to, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. But the last feature of the policy is what we refer to as a early cash out option.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So at any time after you reach 85 years of age, you'll have an option to be able to choose the Intel cover with us. And if you do, we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit amount directly to you whilst you are still living.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : But let's say you decide from once you reach your age of 85, you decide that I just want to stay covered.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Umm, instead you could just keep your policy in place with us and stay covered from the age of 85 and you won't actually have to worry about paying in your premium point onwards.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK, no, that's fine. Thank you.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, no, that's all right. But is that, is that all made sense so far, Christine.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : It does. Thank you.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, you're welcome. And did you have any questions about the cover before we go through some pricing next?
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, that's fine. Umm, that's fine. I just yeah. Umm, umm, no, everything's fine. I don't have any questions.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Now that's OK, cool. Now they've got a good understanding of how that covered those for presumable we'll go through that pricing together.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So you can choose anywhere from the $3000 up to the $15,000 to SUFU in terms of like your, your wishes whenever that time does come. Do you know if you'd be looking into like a cremation or burial service during this time?
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : I do cremation.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Chromatical? There's just give me an indication here because according to the government's Money Smart website, private funerals typically cost somewhere in the region of $4000 for basic cremation, up to $15,000 for more detailed burial service. But, and, and looking at the coverage, what, what amount of cover would you like to get to start off with?
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I'm thinking the 15.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Let's make sure we're starting at the top for the 15,000. And if you want me to bring that down from there, just let me know, OK. Just looking at the coverage of the $15,000 on a full nightly basis that comes to 50.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Hang, hang on a second. I'm, I'm just on the phone. Mum, I'm just on the phone. I'm talking on the phone. I'm talking to a man about some stuff. If it's OK, I'll be. I'll be finished in a minute. Sorry.
[6 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's OK. Oh, no, that's all right.
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : I care for my mother with who has Alzheimer's, and she's, yeah, she's having a bad day today. Sorry. Yeah.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Oh **** no, that's OK. That's so apologize for, umm, my grandfather actually suffered from dementia, so I know exactly where you're, where you're coming from there.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Well, so difficult. Yeah.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, That's, uh, that is very difficult. So good on your phone. I'm obviously care for your mother. I know it is difficult, but umm, stay strong and, and you're doing well. It's umm, yeah.
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Just in terms of the cover of the $15,000 fortnightly Christine, that would be $50.47. That's fortnightly, so $58.47. So just uh, around $29.00 a week roughly.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : $50.00 and 47 and that's a fortnight, OK. And I can just repay that or that debit.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So in terms of yeah, it's all set up through an automatic direct debit, we don't have the option for BPAID, but yeah, it's all done through automatic direct debits come out of your preferred account just with the policy. Just please be aware this insurance does not have anything to investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you'll not receive anything back. And it may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit of now. But do you want me to bring down the cover from the $15,000 Christine? Or would you be happy to start off with that, that amount there?
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : I think I'm starting. I think I'm gonna go with the 15 and stay with that.
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. I'll let you know this.
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : That would be fine.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Cool. I'll just let you know the policy is flexible. So that way if your circumstances do change, need to bring down your cover.
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm, OK.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Umm, it says suppose given us a call to apply to reduce your level of cover and that will just in return reduce the premiums that you pay as well.
