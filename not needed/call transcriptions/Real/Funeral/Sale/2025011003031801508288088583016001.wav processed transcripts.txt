[24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, not a problem. Now, Jeffrey.

[38 seconds][Customer] : Geoffrey Malcolm Carvery, 251258 for One RA Rd., Wilson, WA 657 sue74@westnet.com dot AU.
[55 seconds][Agent] : Amazing, Thank you so much. And just in case Michael didn't mention it, all calls are recorded. And any advice to providers generally, nature may not be suitable to this situation. Just just lastly, confirming both gender and residency, of course, you're a male and also an Australian resident, correct?
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much. Now talk to me just with respect to this cover, I'd love to just get an A quick understanding of what's happened that's made you reach out. Are you are you feeling that you're currently unders underinsured at the moment or is something OK? Just want to re examine it.
[1 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I got my policy anniversary notice and realised that I'm only, I've only got $4000 cover so and haven't been to a couple of funerals of late. Yeah.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : I see. Right. I got you Listen. So, so sorry to hear if you you're experienced lost and and and you've been a funeral recently. That's not a good certainly not a good way to find out this sort of information. But I guess the if we're gonna take a silver lining away from this, at least it's put it on the radar that you maybe need to look at this again, huh?
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, for sure.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK. OK.
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So at the moment I've only got $4000 cover, so I'm looking to have 10,000 total, correct?
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So in which case we'd be, uh, doing that through an additional pop up policy for $6000 to make the total coverage 10,000, is that what you're saying? So, Yep, great.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So our process, Jeffrey, is just to reintroduce the product to you. The reason why we do that is because this is acting as a secondary policy beside the 1st and sometimes the terms and conditions get updated. And so in order to make sure you're across what you're being covered for, I'm just gonna quickly ex re explain to you how it all works. I'll take you first costs to ensure that it is affordable for you, assuming that we've got your approval. Happy to get it in place. We'll start that straight away for you.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, so as I go through this, Jeff, if you've got questions, don't hesitate to umm, jump on in the early stage. But in essence, we try and keep it straightforward and uncomplicated. It's a guaranteed acceptance product for our funeral insurance, which means that, uh, so long as of course, you're an Australian resident between the ages of 40 and 79, which we've already established with you, but that means that for the 1st 12 months, Jeff, you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. After the first 12 months, you'll then be covered for death to any 'cause just to clarify that statement, we're only referring to the additional top up policy. Of course, your existing cover is already in force and assuming you've already had that for 12 months, you'd, you, you'd most likely already be covered for death due to any cause. OK? So we're not referring to your existing policy, only to the additional policy that we're going to put on in place.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, that's wrong.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, good. Now, in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner. Of course, hopefully never death. But in the worst case scenario that does occur, it's a living benefit that can be paid directly to you to help with the costs you may be facing at times, such as your medical expenses, hopefully give you the best finding chance of overcoming your diagnosis. In the event the identity is due to an accident, we triple the chosen benefit amount. And with respect to the accidental serious injury component, it stays in force up until the whole anniversary following the 70th birthday. And it covers events such as quadraplegia or paraplegia. So if you were SU to suffer an event like that during the time that you're covered, we also pay our triple the benefit amount in that situation. And that's a living benefit as well, Jeff. So if that gets paid out, it's not preventing your loved ones down the line from claiming on the death policy. It's over and above that disk, umm, component. OK.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's fine.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : The premiums for the cover are designed to stay the same as you get older. In other words, they're not going to go up to you as you age. Once you reach 85, they're gonna completely cease. So there's nothing further to pay from that age. At that stage. We also automatically add a bonus 25% cover to your benefit amount as a little thank you to you. And we add in an early cash adoption, which just means that anytime after the age of 85, Jeff, you're voluntarily able to end your cover early and we'll pay out 75% of the funeral insurance benefit directly to you. So a little bit of flexibility built into the policy in case circumstances change in the future. Obviously, I appreciate that most people probably don't want to enact that, but it's there if you need it. OK, now you can always find further information about our premium structure on our website. Along with everything else I've just covered off. There's two of the things that I just want to put on your radar. Firstly, you may pay more on top of premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. That is, of course, subject to how long you live. I'm hoping in your case, Jeff, it's a long one, but without that crystal ball, none of us really know, right. And the other thing is with this insurance, please be aware and understand that it does not have a savings or an investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep, correct going off.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : And when I refer to that 30 days, that's the early the, sorry, not 30 days, I'm referring to you, I beg your pardon, is recording. That's very correct. Exactly right. So within that first 30 days after the first payment you've made, you've got a full 30 days in which it's fully refundable and most of the claims have been made. Otherwise outside that. Unless you choose the early cash back offer, once you've reached 85, there's no savings or investment element. Makes sense.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep, all good.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK. Thank you so much. So Jeff, with respect to the cost, the two determining factors are simply your age, the commencement, So, so this is based on a 66 year old and the benefit amount selected, so $6000. So if you're looking at $6000 for your current age, it's $23.39 a fortnight.
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's one.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : In addition, you're already paying OK, You're comfortable with that cost.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : If you're Co, you'd be comfortable with the cost, Jeff, and you're happy with the terms and conditions. As I said, we can arrange to start this straight away. Uh, if you'd like me to line up the pay cycle to match your existing policy, that's no troubles at all, but we get you to nominate your own first payment date so that you can line it up to whatever suits. So just confirming you're happy to con, OK.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Uh, now I could load it up with you. It's the current one. That'll be that'll be good.
[7 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yep, no, no trouble. So just officially confirming Jeff that you're happy to continue at an additional top up policy of $6000 at a cost of $23.39.
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : I am.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And we're setting the first payment date for the 17th of January, is that correct?
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that'll be fine.
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And then it'll just be fortnightly thereafter. Now, Jeff, I don't have any access to your existing payment details that are all securely encrypted, so I need you to give them to me again. Do you want this set up as a direct debit in release? I'll need the BSB and account number. Or would you prefer to use a Visa MasterCard? Sure.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : No, if we can do it the same way, probably don't have the details with me Cos I'm sitting in the car at the moment.
[8 minutes][Agent] : Sometimes when people are in a bind like yourself, they have their banking app on the phone and they're able to grab those details that way. As a worst case scenario, Jeff, we can always just pop it on a card and update it in the future if you need to do that.
[7 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, that'd be fine. I can give you a call back on it. So yeah, quick.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, So just use your cards for the moment.
[8 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : That number will be UH51.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : I don't, don't stop. Stop.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Sorry. Stop.
[8 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Pardon me. Yeah.
[8 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Jeff, please, just for security purposes, while obtaining your card details, the call recording will stop and we'll recommend some expected details. None. Submitted. Just reminding you, please advise the call recording is now resumed for quality and monitoring purposes. OK, so with the address details that I confirmed with you before, they're all up to date and you get your mail sent to your home address I'm assuming?
[9 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Correct.
[9 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So the last step in that case, Jeff is just agreed, read you a declaration statement to confirm your acceptance. So I'll read through that in full. At the end there's a couple of questions. If you accept, you'll be covered for that moment.
