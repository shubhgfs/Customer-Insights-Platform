[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : So Lynn will be, uh, in 10 years time, she would, she'll be approaching 85 and the total uh, for those premiums came to 17,857, which is a lot more than the $10,000 that we were talking about.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, well then the please keep in mind it is here to protect, you know do wish leading yourself a long and healthy life, but it is here to protect her between now and then if anything was to happen. And also remember that if her death is due to accident, that chosen benefit that would triple to $30,000. OK. So those are some of the benefits in place as well more?
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Well, that's, that's, that's a myth. I'm looking at certain things. Now you talk.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[2 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : You mentioned to me after 12 months we get it back. Cash back of 178.
[2 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Let me quickly look into it. First, can I get, I'll just get them to confirm her first name, last name and date of birth, please.

[2 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Mm Hmm yes.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful. Thank you. That Graham laughs, laughs at me every time.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that is ridiculous.
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Sometimes the obvious we do need to ask.
[2 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : You know you have to be careful.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Now nowaday there is not just, you know, male or female, there is also other as well.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Absolutely AB well about that sale fee am grand. We carry on.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So we do need to confirm umm and also so OK, that's alright. Umm well yes Sir Graham, we are following a first year anniversary. The real reward cash back is $178.57. OK, Yep.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Thank you Wendy care right now question is will that happen every year?
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : No, just for the first year.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Oh, hell.
[3 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : So in.
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : MMM, yeah. Hmm. Mm.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : In other words, yeah, because I was just working it out, but $178 and every year as a cash back would bring it back to a RE a more reasonable figure, the premiums.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, totally understand, like Graham, if you want to work it out that way very realistically, yes, umm, but look, as mentioned, you know, with the reason why you are looking to is to, you know, have that Peace of Mind if anything was to happen between now and then, you know, to live again, as as mentioned, we do wish you a long and healthy life there. So and and it's just bear in mind, you know, the the triple the benefit now you know, if there for street for accident there. So those, those are the the features and benefits.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah well, I, I, I think that's lovely. You know, triple the benefit, the umm and uh, due to accident, but God, you know who would, who would wish that?
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, Uh, mm, hmm. Of course.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : The other I have is umm, during the 10 year.
[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : And if we wish, or if Lynn wishes, can she cancel the policy and get the money back?
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : No, so it's not this policy does not have a saving or investment element, OK? So therefore, once she cancels, she will lose everything. The only time that she she wants to cancel and then she wants to be able to cash out is after she reached her 85th birthday. So she can choose to end her cover and we will pay her 75% of the federal insurance benefit.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : 75% is it?
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, correct. OK, so just rehashing them to Lean because I haven't spoken to her.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So Lean, I'll just let you know the features and benefits because I've read them out to Graham already is that you know for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental series injury only after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause. OK, so now I need he doesn't, you know, have something to leave behind for grams and after the funeral or you know any final expenses.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : There is also a protection for you. So in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first on as the terminal illness with 12 months, unless by a medical practitioner such as cancer, we will pay the claim amount in full to you while you are still alive.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So you can use that money for whatever you want, OK?
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm. Mm, hmm.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Umm, just so you know as well, if you were to suffer an accidental serious injury such as quadruplager or paraplager before the policy anniversary following your 70th birthday, that benefits and that will also triple, OK? Umm, premium are designed to stay the same as you get older and when you reach the age of 85, your premium will cease, meaning you have nothing more to pay and your cover will continue for free.
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : And at that time you will receive a 25% bonus cover that gets applied to the benefit amount as well.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK, so that's another thing Graham.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Now 25% of what?
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : There is a 25% bonus cover that gets applied to the your benefit amount, OK, of whatever you're chosen as your benefit amount, which is the 10,000 for this instance.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : So 25% of that would be 2 1/2 thousand.
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right in there.
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So that will be automatically, you will automatically receive that on top of your benefit amount. OK. Information about premium structure is also available on your website.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that sorry that that 2 1/2 thousand is added to the 10,000.
[7 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Correct.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[8 minutes][Agent] : Yeah.
[8 minutes][Customer] : At what? At what point?
[8 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So that's applied to your benefit amount after she reached the age of 85. OK.
[8 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Alright, yeah.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : And also the cash out option as mentioned rings at any time after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose the annual cover and we will pay you 75% of your insurance benefits. So that's optional. So if you do wanna take it out, you do have the option there, OK. And as mentioned, you may pay more in total premiums over the last of the policies and the benefit now. So please be aware this insurance does not have a saving or investment element. So if you cancel us after 30 days, your cover will stop and you're not receiving anything back unless you're eligible for choose the early cash back offer.
