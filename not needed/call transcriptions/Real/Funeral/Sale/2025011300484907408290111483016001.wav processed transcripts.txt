[3 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I get you. Yep.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : It was a really sorry, crappy year last year, and it was the last thing on my mind, the last thing. And I went like where I'm sitting here, I'm just gonna get this done. It has to be done.

[4 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : I'm 63, so I understand what you're saying.
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Oh, oh, goodness me. I know.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Alright, let let me get you a hubby.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : And time just disappears like that.
[4 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I get you, I get you. I think once you hit 60, it's like wait, wait, wait. Hang on a minute. Just slow down. It's me. Alright? What's the name for the hubby, please?
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah:.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Collins. Colin.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Ian.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And if you got the same surname as yourself, TITEAL. Yeah.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep, no teal TEALTEA outlaw.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. And what's his date of birth?
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep, the 23rd of the 8th, 1958.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yep, 1958. OK, so he's, he's six years old. And he is he a male Australian resident? Is that all correct?
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : OK, so let me look here. I'll put him here as Mr. I'll put him there as your husband.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, There we go. Alright. OK, anyone? So everything I'm about to speak about is for both of you, OK? Because you're both under the age of 75. So let me explain so how the cover works. It's a cash benefit for your loved ones now, umm, then use it for funeral, final expenses, anything at all, OK? And it's up to $15,000 each, alright?
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Umm, please keep in mind for both of you, if your death was due to an accident, the benefit amount your family receives will be tripled for them. OK? So let's say you've got $5000 each, right? If your death was due to an accident, your family will get 15,000 in that case.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK, right.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Alright OK now it's easy to apply. I don't for any medical checks. Because you're both Australian residents age between 40 and 79. It is a guaranteed acceptance for you.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, now be because you're both under the age of 75, there is there's a couple of living benefits, but one of them is called an accidental serious injury component. So basically if you were to have a really serious car accident, this is where you might be able to look at this one. So if you were to suffer an accidental serious injury or if column was before your policy anniversary and your 75th birthday, and I'm talking about things such as quadriplegic or paraplegic for instance, what's gonna happen is the benefit and that's triple and it's paid to you instead.
[6 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so let's see now I don't mean instead, sorry, I take that word out. It's paid to you. Now all colonies, that was the case. Now if that was the case and you do make a claim on that, but you don't pass away from the injuries, the policy is still in place there for your funeral cover as well because it is a living benefit. Does that make sense?
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Understand.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So I mean, hopefully that never happens, but it's there if needed.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, So for both of you, how the cover works for the 1st 12 months for both of you, you will both be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury, which is only, which is tripling. OK.
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Then after the first four months, everything kicks in. So after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause. And also for both of you, there's another living benefit. In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means holding your policy for 12 months if either of you, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness, we're 12 months always to leave by a medical practitioner. What we're doing in that case is paying the claim in full to you instead. OK, so you've got 2 living benefits on there basically.
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Right, Yes. Oh good God, I have enough trouble.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : All right now, depending on what your needs are, depending on what you're wanting, because people have lots of the ideas of what they want when the time comes, whether it's a burial or a cremation or whether it's fancy, whether it's not fancy, both things.
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I have enough trouble working on the living side of things, let alone the diving side.
[8 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So, so you know and I can help you with that. I can show you we've got an excerpt from the government's Money Smart website so I can give you ideas of what things cost as well.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So we can look between 3 and 15,000. But a couple of things I really want you to understand with this policy, your premiums are designed to stay the same for you year on year as you get older.
[8 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK, got to reach 85.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Alright, and then when you're you've 85, they stop, nothing more for you to pay, but the policy is still in place, OK Yep. Well, hopefully you will.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Oh goodness.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Now when you reach 85, there's a bonus there. Your family will actually get an extra 25% bonus cover applied at no cost to you, but you're not paying anything extra after 85 and neither is Colin.
[8 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : But the policy is still in place, OK.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. Now if you understood everything I've said so far, it is.
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : You've got any questions for me?
[9 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : No, not yet.
[9 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, excellent.
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Not yet.
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Because I'd like to break it all down to make it as simple as possible. I want you to be clear as water, not mud.
[9 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : There are some of them are very confusing.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So now I do understand what you're saying. That's why I always break it down so that you've got a clear understanding because you need to know what you've got. Yeah.
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So the last thing that is there for you if either of you, when you get to 85, if you want to, and you don't have to, but if you didn't wanna end your cover, you can choose to end your cover and we'll pay out to 75% of the funeral insurance benefit of that. It's called what we call an early cash out option.
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[9 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So if you decide when you get to 85, you know what, I wanna end this all. Umm, I wanna ha take the early cash out option and have a party. You can do that instead. OK, I know.
[9 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Good God, it'd be somebody, wouldn't it?
[9 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : So you can look between 3 and $15,000 of cover. Now let me explain to you. This is from the government's Money Smart website. Umm. So depending on what you're wanting at the time. According to the government's Money Smart website, private funerals typically cost somewhere in the region for $4000 for basic cremation and can be up to $15,000 for more detailed burial service. And that's including all the costs associated with your funeral. OK, So what are you guys wanting in the future? Like what amount do you want to look at first? Because I can play around with the figures for a little bit.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, no, it's definitely barrel you. We've got our plot.
[10 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : You cremation or a burial or oh, oh, mm hmm.
[10 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : That's the thing. We've got our plot. It's just and we we just.
[10 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So some of the costs are already covered. Yeah.
[10 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, the plot's covered for two the both of us.
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK. ***** and bobs.
[10 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : So it's the initial when you pass to when you get planted.
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha.
[11 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I'm sort of thinking, I'm not sure what we're actually, we haven't discussed it any further than the plot at this stage.
[11 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, OK. But that's already paid for. Yeah.
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : But yes, yes, that's already done and dusted so and that's not going to change.
[11 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Alright, well, well, let's start in the middle, umm, because you can look for three up to 15,000. In the middle is where it's actually just been automatically loaded. I'll show you that and then I can play around with these figures so we get something that works for you. So if you looked at 8000 each, which is still $24,000 for your accidental debt and accidental series injury cover for both of you, alright, Rhonda, yours would come in at $37.22 per fortnight.
[11 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[11 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Collins comes in at $35.08 per fortnight.
[12 minutes][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So the two of you together is coming in at $72.30 per fortnight now basically just over $36 a week probably. And that of course is only two. You reached age of 85 and then that will stop and the same for Colin there as well.
[12 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[12 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : But does that sound 7230 cents a fortnight? Does that sound like that's within your budget or do you want me to look for a different amount that's covering both of you?
[12 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : It's, yeah, that, and I get that.
[12 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[12 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : It sounds reasonable in the fact that if I have to pay out for a funeral that we're not covered for, they're gonna demand it all at once and that won't happen.
[12 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, I get you, I get you.
[12 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[12 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Well, let me cover off on a couple of things and we can look at your options. I just want to explain a couple of things as well to you. Get your details up and we can look at your options. So you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. Please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you will not receive anything back. We do, however, give you a refund following your policy anniversary date. We do refund back to you 10% of the premiums that you had paid in at that time as a thank you. So you'd get $188 back so you can go out for dinner or something. And if you don't have a will in place, we do provide you with a free online legal will and this is valued at $160.00 with your policy. That's complementary for you. OK, You do get it in an e-mail.
[13 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yep, we have a willing place.
[13 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, alright, alright.
[13 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : We've got some of the boxes ticked.
[13 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : But if you do decide you want to update or something, you've got some of them. That's cool. That's good. Alright, let me update your details. What's your e-mail address? Thank you. Rhonda. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Where?
[13 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : So Splash RJC at hotmail.com.
[13 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Where did this names come from?
[13 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Well, Splash was the name of the business I had.
[14 minutes][Agent] : Oh, yeah, oh, what was the business? Was it swimming business or?
[13 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : The RJC is my initial and yeah, there is no ceramic splash of color. It was. Yeah.
[14 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Oh, oh, I thought you meant like a swimming school or something. Oh, my mind was going all over the place. Nice.
[14 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah. Well, no backtrack. It was easier than that. Yep. Yep.
[14 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Hmm. All right, so mobile, 0417035614 mm. Do you have a landline as well or just a mobile? It's OK. What's your post code? Where you reside? Thanks. Rhonda.
[14 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : No, we just use the mobile 3355.
[14 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : These are in Victoria. OK. And what's a, umm, town? Thanks. Suburb.
[14 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : I am, I'm in Windaray, which is a suburb of Ballarat.
[14 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK. So Windery? Yeah. I love Ballarat. It's pretty pretty. I love Sovereign Hill. I loved it. What's the address at Windery? It's not the same, but yeah. Oh.
[14 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Look, I can tell you now, 36, super huge, this place now super huge.
[15 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Oh, wow.
[15 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : There's so many people from Melbourne have moved here and it's just grown this city hugely. I would say we have.
[15 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Oh, so it's not a little country town I loved.
[15 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : No, it's not the one that I moved to either.
[15 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK.
[15 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[15 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Oh, all right. Now. Now.
[15 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : It's sad.
[15 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : I don't want to go back now.
[15 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : I've been here. 20. No, sorry.
[15 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[15 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : I was sovereign history 26 years ago. I moved here. There were 90,000 people. 26 years. Yeah. Yep.
[15 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Well, I went there on my honeymoon 30 years ago and umm, I remember Ballarat being a lovely little place where I could actually get a really nice roast meal with roasted vegetables because I've been on the road and, you know, it's like eating everywhere. I just wanted something plain. And I just went to this little pub and I got the most beautiful roast dinner and I said, can I just get, I don't want the meat, I'll give it to my husband. I just want a really big plate of roast vegetables. And I looked at me silly and I went, no, no, I want all the vegetables in the gravy. And they were accommodating and, and it was really yummy. It was just a real standard Aussie roast. It was just absolutely beautiful. And they said, yeah, we, we're country, so we do it that way. So, and it was a lovely little sandstone pub. It was like Sandstock, I think it was. It was very, very old and it was in Ballarat and I, I loved it. It's really nice. So I got nice memories.
[16 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep, No, 30 years ago, a lot of those, yeah. So 30 years ago, a lot of those pubs aren't even here now.
[16 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : I bet you they weren't either. Yeah, I bet you they're all gone. All right.
[16 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : No, not all of them, some of them.
[16 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. All right, let's get your address. So 36. Oh, nice name. And is your home address and your postal address both the same? OK. All right, Let me have a look here for you. So. OK, is that OK? So what I'm able to do I'm able to actually both get you covered in over the phone today. You're not however required to make any payments at all today. It's actually set up for date in the future of your choice. So I'll work with you on that and I will send all your policy documents to review. You'll get an e-mail very shortly. You'll get everything out to the home address. You get it generally within 5 working days and our policy gives you a full 30 day cooling off. As well. So if you find that it's not suitable for you and you wanna cancel, as long as you let us know within the 30 days, you'll get a full refund of all of your premium unless you made a claim. It can cover you today for both of you and put the date in the future and you'll both be covered today. What would you like to use? A savings, a check account or a card? Thanks.
[16 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : But anyway, yeah, moving right along 36 Violet Grove yes, Yep, Yep, Yep. I will give you a card.
[17 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Alright, now do you wanna leave it on 8000? That's the one you're happy with?
[17 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : So Well, I don't know really. It's the cost.
[17 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Well, that's 7230 per fortnight, so yeah.
[18 minutes][Customer] : Yeah.
[18 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I'm so sorry.
[18 minutes][Customer] : I'm sort of thinking along the line of how much are they going to increase funerals by on, you know, like a yearly basis pretty much because I know when I buried someone 20 years ago, a bunch of buried people born now is just totally different.
[18 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : And I don't really want to have a shortfall to have to pick up, if you know what I mean. Yeah. True.
[18 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : The thing is, I wanna make sure it's within your budget, though, OK, So I can take it up a little bit if you want.
[18 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I recognize it. This.
[18 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Let me show you 10,000 or leave it on the eighth, OK?
[18 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's, that's the for for each of us, isn't it?
[18 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's correct. That's covering both of you. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
[18 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[18 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Mm. Hmm. Yeah. MMM.
[18 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : And and it may not take that, but when I found out the cost of Wales 2 years ago for she for my mother-in-law again they had a heart attack.
[19 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : You see, and that's the thing.
[19 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : They probably have been expensive.
[19 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Some people want something really simple and other people want something really elaborate. And when it comes to things like flowers and that and Cuffins and that depends on what they're wanting. Like some people I've spoken to people that have things that are completely over the top, you know, like, umm, they're going intern and they're getting bombed and all sorts of stuff. And then other people, yeah, they just want some wildflowers on, on the coffin or they just want, you know, they don't, they don't want them, you know. Yeah, like they do. And there's so many different options that you can have. Yeah. So if if you stick with the 8000, it's still coming in at your 24,000 if your death with you to an accident or for your accident or serious injury of you still got that.
[19 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, So what I can OK, Yes.
[19 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Look, look, I think it's probably plenty and it gives you, look, if you need to make something different, at least you've got the backup there to do that.
[20 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : You got the buffer. Yeah, I get you. Alright.
[20 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that's what I'm kind of thinking. And I know it's got to be paid for and I'm fine about that. That's all good.
[20 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Alright. So what day in this?
[20 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : I'm not thinking I'm gonna make it 85 S.
[20 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Well, So what day in the future do you want your first payment to come out then? Thank you. I'll work with you.
[20 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : I will give you a date on that.
[20 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. And have a look.
[20 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : I'll give you a date. What's today? Today is the first. We've got the 13th. OK, we can do it for the 16th.
[20 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : 13th Monday, Yeah. So that's Thursday and then fortnightly after that. Yeah.
[20 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Yep.
