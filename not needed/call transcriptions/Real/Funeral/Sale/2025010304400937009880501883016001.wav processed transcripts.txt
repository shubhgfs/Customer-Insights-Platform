[8 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No, we can, we can afford that.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK, Well, that's great. It is important. Affordability is the most important thing when coming to this kind of stuff. Umm, do you? All of us will have a current well in place by any chance, Sherry?

[9 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
