[10 seconds][Agent] : That's good to hear. Carly.
[15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that's cool. Yeah.
[11 seconds][Agent] : I'm just giving you a call back here today to pull up on the funeral insurance inquiry there to have a look into that one further for you, just so I can speak a little bit more freely. I'll I'll just let you know that all of our calls are recorded. Any advice to provide? Is similar nature going to be suitable to your situation? Do you mind just confirming your full name and date of birth, please?
[31 seconds][Customer] : Claire Louise Baston, 4th of the 4th, 1984.
[35 seconds][Agent] : Lovely. Thanks so much for confirming those details there, Carly. So from what I can see there, umm, previously we were able to quote you, uh, $10,000 of the funeral insurance coming in at 4, about $16.08 per fortnight there for you. How's that sounding in terms of suitability for you?
[49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[54 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. No worries. The, uh, what I'll do there is I'll just make sure that this quote is all correct. So you can select anywhere from the $3000 to the $15,000 mark. And you're happy with the $10,000, is that right?
[1 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Actually, can you do the 15?
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : The 5th day, Yeah. No worries. Let me bring that one up for you.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : How's your day been today so far there, Carly?
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Good. Yeah, good. And yours.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's good to hear you. Yeah, not bad. Can't complain.
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Where are you? Oh, geez. They're not that clear with the other one.
[1 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Unfortunately, the weather's not too great today, but umm, we're here in Sydney, No, the last two days. So on Tuesday I think it wasn't a 40Â°.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, far out. I'm in Melbourne and it's ******* pretty hot.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : But the last two days been rainy and miserable, unfortunately, or at least you get some, some. If we look at $15,000 there, Carly, it brings it up to $24.12 per fortnight. Is that OK?
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's alright.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Lovely. Just keep in mind for the 1st 12 months you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury Only after the first 12 months you'll be covered for deaths due to any cause.
[1 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit included as well, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, that claim can be paid directly to you to help you have any medical expenses there.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : OK, cool.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Did you have someone in mind there, Carly, that you would be listing down as your beneficiary? You too perfect.
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : My two sons, Jordan and Noah Walker. Yeah, yeah, yes, right.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : No worries, we'll get them listed down as the beneficiaries and then if anything happens they call it that lump sum benefit will be paid directly to them with the cost of the cover. Your premiums are designed to stay the same as you get older.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : There's no yearly based increase or anything like that. As this is the insurance policy, you may pay more in total premiums over the last of the policy than the benefit amount. So please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you wouldn't receive anything back unless you are eligible for and choose the early cash back offer, which is an option that you have available to you there. Carly, at any time after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose the end your cover and we will pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit while you're living.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm sorry.
