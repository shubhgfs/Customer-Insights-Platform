[2 seconds][Agent] : Welcome to Real INSURANCE. You're speaking with DJ. How can I help you today?
[6 seconds][Customer] : Oh, hi. I was just wondered. I was just wanting to give a bit of an idea about the real insurance, how much it's gonna cost and that sort of stuff for funeral insurance.
[16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. I'd be happy to take you through some of our funeral coverage. Have you gone with us before in the past name or would this be your first time today?
[21 seconds][Customer] : No, no, the first time.
[23 seconds][Agent] : First time. I just want to say thank you for taking the time out of your morning. You're coming through to us here at Real INSURANCE. Just so I can bring up some updated information on the pricing of our funeral coverage. I'll just get you to confirm a few of your details. So if I could just start off with your first name. Thank you, and last name, please, Denise. And then just your date of birth. So that was the first of what month, Sir?
[38 seconds][Customer] : Denise Denise Rowe Rowe 1st of May 1948, May 1st of the 5th 1948.
[56 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for that. And just confirming, Denise, that you're an Australian resident, is that correct?
[1 minutes][Customer] : Born and bred here.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : That's fine. Just have to provide to my end. So was that a useful note to add to that residency question? Yep. Cool. And just with the mobile number that you've called us off today, is this your best contact number for yourself?
[1 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes it is.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Now while the processing is uploaded here for our funeral coverage, Denise, I'll explain to you a bit more about how the cover works and what's included in the cost as well. If at any time, if you do have any questions, don't hesitate to let me know, OK? I'll be happy to answer this for you. But if you don't mind me asking, just to give me an understanding of your inquiry today, what sparked the interest? You want to take a look at this insurance for yourself?
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Oh no, it's just I'm 76 now. I'm hoping to do the next 20 years, but I may not.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Well, in touch, but hopefully nothing that's happened anytime soon for sure.
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : I just wanted to have it have myself covered for my kids so that when I do go, they can afford to bury me.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, No, that all makes sense. Well, I didn't say that's pretty much what our funeral coverage is designed to do. They need to be paid out as a lump sum payment to your beneficiaries to be able to cover these costs.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So hopefully that's not a financial burden there for them to have to cover on their own as you mentioned. And for that purpose, self funeral covered the needs that is being designed to be paid out most quickly. So once we do receive the relevant documentation to process the claim for funeral insurance, these funds generally get paid out within 24 to 48 business hours.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Mm, Hmm.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So we just want to make sure that we can have these funds paid out as quick as possible. So hopefully the financial side of things is the last of your loved ones were restring this time.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : And when it comes to organizing the funeral coverage, it's very simple. It's all done over the phone. So there's no medicals, blood tests or anything like that required from you.
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : But just so you know, for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death only. And after the first 12 months you will be covered for death due to any cause.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So you can rest assured that once you've held the policy of 12 for 12 months, Denise, no matter how you pass away from that point onwards, you can rest assure that you'll be covered.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : But if touch would, if you happen to pass away unexpectedly from an accident at any time, wash you are covered under this policy with us. The benefit amount that you're covered for that actually triples. So let's say you account for the likes of umm, the say $5000 as an example.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : None.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : That benefit amount with triple for accidental debt compound a total of $15,000 to UB Fisheries. OK. Now also for that extra peace in mind at no extra cost, there is a So in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to look by a medical practitioner, then we can pay out your claim in full just to help with things like medical expenses, et cetera. But a couple of things in this policy, Denise, is your premiums are designed to stay the same. So you don't have to worry about our premiums increasing every year as you're getting older.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : But once you reach the age of 85, there is an option where you can actually anytime after you reach 85 years of age, you have an option to be able to choose the inch or cover with us. And if you do, we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit amount directly to you whilst your wife still living. But if you prefer to stay covered on the age of 85, you can just keep your policy in place with us and stay covered and you won't have to worry about paying any more premiums from the age of 85. OK. But if you do wish to Dinesh, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. But has that all made sense so far?
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, Yes it does. Yes, it does.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : And did you have any questions before we start by for some pricing?
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No, not really. I just want to make sure that the kids are covered, that's all. So that when I go, I've got enough money.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : No, for sure, that makes sense. Well, we'll go through some pricing. I'll work with you today, Denise, so we can find that cover that you're happy to leave behind for your children. So how many children do you have? So, and, and grandchildren as well.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Bear with ME3, 3 my 3 grandchildren.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Oh, nice. And, umm, because in terms of how we do payout the funds, you can nominate up to five beneficiaries, uh, to receive their nominated benefit amount. And have you organized a will for yourself at this stage? Uh, Denise. Oh, OK, cool. That's fine. Because, umm, with our customers, we do actually provide for free online legal will, which is valued at $160.00 of each policy. So if you need to organize a new one, you can use it to help make that process easy and hopefully save some money in the process of doing so as well. Is whenever it does, whenever that time does come. Denise, have you given any thought of whether you'd be looking into like the cremation or burial service during this time?
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK, it'll be a cremation.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Cremation. So sorry to hear.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : My husband passed away three years ago and with my peers.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Oh, nice.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Ashes here and the kids are gonna join us together and get it together.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that makes sense because in terms of the cover that we do offer does range from the $3000 up to the $15,000. How much cover were you wanting to look at to start off with please?
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : No, probably. How much is it? I think it was about four and a half thousand for my husband. So probably 5 or $6000, something like that.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. Did you want me to start off at the the five or the 6000? Yeah, sure.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : 5000 yes, that'd be happy.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So if you're looking at the $5000 of cover fortnightly, that would be $42.42, so just over $21.00 a week roughly. And if you're looking, I'll give you so that, uh, $6000 could clear with as well. So for the $6000 of cover, that one would be $50.91 a fortnight, so just over $25 a week roughly. But once you've actually held your policy of us for 12 months, Denise, so following your first policy anniversary date, we will be refunding your back 10% of the premiums that you've paid to us in that time. So there's no way of saying thank you. So based off the $6000 of cover, you'll see back the real award of $132.35.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Well, based off the $5000 of cover, you'll receive back the real award of $110.30. OK.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : I think I'd go for the $5000.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's totally fine. And looking further down the track, Denise, if you decide that you need that extra cover with us any time from now on before you turn 80, you can actually give us a call to apply to take out a separate top up policy of up to another $10,000 subject to eligibility. Or you can apply to reducing level of cover as well. But just please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment elements. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your cover will stop and you'll not receive anything back. And you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. But what I'll do next here, Denise, is I'll just go ahead and update all your contact details. So we can always just send that all out to you. Do you have an e-mail address? So we can send the electronic copy of that to you today? Yep.
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, Yep, it's Rowe. Rowe, Denise. 894 at gmail.com.

[8 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : And can I just confirm, Denise, are you happy to continue with the coverage of the $5000?
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. So good news is you have the Peace of Mind on that. You'll be covered for the $5000 over the phone from today. And you can actually choose that payment date to start within the next 30 days to suit you as well. And then that's just going to come out every fortnight from that date that you select that to start from. OK. Now, if you want to have a take, let's take a look at your calendar and just let me know what you prefer that directly, but to start from, no questions.
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Alright, now starting from next Friday, that's my pension day, so it can come out that day.
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So next Friday, I'll just let you know that will be the Friday the 17th of January. Does that work well for you?
[9 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[9 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And what's the direct debit, Denise?
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : I'll give you my card number.

And we don't need you to read out the security numbers at the back either. So you keep that for your own security, but I'll just pause that call recording for you now.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : None.
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Reminder, it just reads, please be advised that the call recording has now issued for quality and monitoring purposes. But just to finalize your cover today, Denise, I just have to quickly read out a verbal declaration of your next.
