[42 seconds][Agent] : Oh, yeah, yeah, We have life insurance. We've got both life and funeral products there. We've also got like an income protection and stuff there too. So you're looking to start one for yourself now, aren't you?

[1 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : One in 70. Lovely. Alright, I'll just bring this up here. OK. And do you have an e-mail address you're happy to list with this? Yeah.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep, it's e.mylastnamehanahui@hotmail.com.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, beautiful. OK, alright. And the number we're talking on now, that's your best contact.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : What?
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Number one ending in 680. Lovely. Alright, now for the, so it was the funeral insurance you're looking at or was it a life insurance you're looking to swap over to you because the life insurance does have a funeral complainant included in it.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Well, the funeral 1 was just so easy peasy. And So what?
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, alright, let's pull that up here.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : What sort of what sort of life insurance are we talking about and what sort of death insurance? So if I was to die, they could just put put you guys straight through and then the money comes through. So I thought, yeah.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so yeah, so they both work a little bit differently. Now, the funeral advance works the same as a funeral cover in the sense that like the funeral insurance, because it's designed for the funeral, which is time sensitive, we don't require an actual death certificate. It's more along the lines of proof of death that we're looking for, which comes can come along the lines of like a doctor or a doctor's note or a letter from the hospital or something like that.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : And then, yeah, there's that claim form to get sorted and then we get that money to you. Once everything's been submitted and we've gone through that yet 2 to one to two business days, we'd get that money across to you. It's just same as the funeral advance. Now a funeral advance comes out of the life insurance as an advance payment to get the funeral sorted. And then the rest of the life insurance would get handled at a pace it suits the family, you know, after they've had a chance to grieve there. But with the funeral insurance, the minimum and maximum is between 3000 and $15,000, whereas the life insurance, the minimum is $100,000 I believe there. And it depends on your, so your application is to the maximum that you can do. So yeah, like the, I think like the, the, the highest threshold for the life insurance is like $2,000,000. But yeah, the minimum's 100,000. So like there's more of an application process involved in the life insurance because it is for obviously like a lot higher amount. The funeral insurance is a fairly simple process to get sorted out there. So I mean, it depends on what suits or circumstances or what you're looking for to be covered in the policy. Yeah, beautiful.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Well, the one that you just mentioned, the one where all you need is a report from the hospital or what have you and it gets paid out after a couple of days, that's definitely one that I'd like.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK. So that'll be the funeral insurance there where the minimums the 3000 and the maximums 15,000. How much were you thinking of being covered for on that 1 then?
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, the 15.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So for 15,000 and as a fortnightly monthly or annual payment?
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : So how much are the payments monthly?
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So as a monthly payment, that would be $76.85 a month, 85 cents, yeah.
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : So $76.80 K, Yeah, $76.85. And if we split that into fortnightly, that's 39.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So as a fortnightly payment, it's $35.47 because the way that it works out is we get the annual payment and divide it by either 12 months or 26 fortnights.
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, let's go with the actually, yeah, no, go with the 7685 if you can. Thanks.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, go with the monthly one there. Beautiful.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yes, thanks.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Alright, so yeah, what I'll do. So I don't actually have access to set that one up fully. I'll go and get one of our specialists on the line here. You can set that up for you. I'll just put you on a brief hold while I reach out to them.

[7 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : And if I could also have a look at your guys life insurance as well, because I'd rather keep everything all in one and you guys were were amazing so quite happy to.

I'll, I'll, if we do, we'll, we'll give you a call sometime over the next one or two business or a couple of times over the next one or two business days to try and get that sorted out for you.

[11 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : All right, what I'll do, I'll try one more time. I'll put you on hold and I'll try one more time. Yeah, just do that. If not, then I'll leave notes to, you know, make sure that we call and maybe we'll work out, you know, times that you're available. And I'll leave those in the notes there so that I can give you a call accordingly. Or if we haven't called you, you can call us obviously, if you find yourself with some time there.
