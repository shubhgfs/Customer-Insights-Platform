[37 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's correct.
[39 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic. All right, awesome. Yeah. Just so I can get a bit of a better understanding of your situation there. Kathy, what's, what's got you looking into funeral insurance recently? Umm, do you have something in place or are you completely new to it?
[50 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm completely new to it.
[53 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Yep. OK. Oh, no. OK.
[53 seconds][Customer] : I just, I just have, I ha, I'm single, I have two daughters and I just, you know, I had a friend that was caught in a, a stabbing incident and, and, you know, it kind of just kind of just made me think that if anything ever happened, how would my girls, you know, be able to cover the costs, etcetera.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK.
[1 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : And so I've just been having a, a think and I know there are plans out there. Look, yeah, I, I don't know how to go about it. I don't know what to do.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. No, I understand 100%.
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : So, yeah, that's why I applied just to put my feelings out there just to see, you know.
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a problem, Kathy. Well, I'm so sorry to hear about your friend. It's, it really is unfortunate moments like that in life that do put things into perspective for ourselves sometimes. But umm, yeah.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Especially when he was not good.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : But honestly, yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, are you Sir? OK, Yeah.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Like he's, he's really 50s and he was, he was trying to sell a car on marketplace and yeah.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Wow.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : And the guy tried to hijack it and it's just, you know, it, it just brings things to realization of. And yeah. And I just, I just thought, oh, what is it? Yeah, yeah. That that's my reason.
[2 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 100%. Well, thank you so much for sharing that. And honestly, it, that's what funeral cover is designed to do. It is to give you that Peace of Mind that your loved ones are gonna be financially protected of the cost of the funeral if something, yeah, completely something was to happen, something unexpected. So, yeah, that is what our cover is designed to do there. Uh, what I'll do, uh, running through the process and give you the, uh, main features and benefits so we can run through some pricing options together.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So our cover is designed to provide a cash benefit of up to $15,000 to your loved ones when you pass away. They can use the funds not only for the funeral expenses, but any other final expenses at the time, something like unpaid bills. So you can nominate 5 beneficiaries, so you can nominate two daughters there to receive the nominated benefit amount. If death is due to an accident, then the charge and benefit will triple. And an accident would be something that's not like natural causes, so something similar to what might have happened to your friend. Yeah, uh, it's really easy to apply. There's no medical checks. If you're an Australian resident age between 40 and 79, acceptance is guaranteed. Uh, just so you know as well, if you were to suffer an accidental serious injury such as quadriplegia or paraplegia before the policy anniversary following your 75th birthday, the benefit amount will also triple. And for the first four months, you'll be called for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months, you'll be coming for death due to any cause. In addition, uh, Kathy, there is a terminal illness benefit. Uh, so not going with this, never has to apply to yourself, but is there for that Peace of Mind. So after holding a policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner who will pay your claim in full while you are alive to help with things like expenses. OK, Now you can choose between $3000 up to $15,000. Uh, a couple of things to note here is your premiums are designed to stay the same as you get older.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Uh, when you reach the age of 85, your premiums will cease. So cover still stays in place, but you just have nothing more to pay. Uh, on top of that, you will also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover, which will be applied to your benefit amount. Uh, you can also find information about our pre instruction on our website. Uh, Kathy, do you have any questions for me so far about anything?
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't think so. I think I'm yeah, I think I'm OK.
[4 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK all right no worries. Well, final benefit then we can get into the uh, the pricing together, so the cover also provides you with an early cash out option. So anytime after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover and we'll pay you 75% of the fuel insurance benefit. OK uh now let's go through some pricing. As I mentioned, the level of cover ranges from 3000 up to $15,000. Uh, what benefit amount would you like me to look at first? And I'm more than happy to provide as many different pricing options as you'd like. I can see here that you put in $9000 online. We can just choose the starting spot.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Oh gosh, yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Then we can go up or down just depending on, you know, what fits the budget.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : OK, let's do that.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, of course.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Like I said, I really have no idea what you know, and I'm just looking into it like, I just wanna know what's available, what OP, you know, the options, etcetera. Yeah.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yes, definitely, 100%. I think that's a great idea. OK, so for a $9000 benefit amount, you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $21.28. Do you feel that $9000 would be enough to, you know, cover the cost of a funeral and protects your daughters if it were to happen?
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : So, OK, Well, umm, yeah, I'd probably not.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Maybe maybe.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. What's the 15,000 mm?
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So $15,000 fortnightly premium of $35.47 and keeping in mind when you do purchase the policy, it's looking in that price at the time of application. So even as you get older, it will still remain at the $35.47.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah, OK.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : It's not going to increase as you get older in terms of, you know, affordability. I know you're just starting to look into this at the moment, but did you have a an idea in mind of how much you wanted to, you know, put aside towards the your funeral insurance at all?
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : It was, it was around 30, between 30 to 40 a fortnight, Yeah.
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, so $15,000 is the, uh, the maximum benefit amount. Again, you get the, uh, the triple payout if it was, you know, an accidental death. So if, uh, that was, if something was to happen, umm, you would've passed away from an accident, Uh, the beneficiaries would receive $45,000.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yep uh, on top of that, uh, you also received the, uh, real rewards, uh, which is attached to the policy. So following your first policy anniversary date, we'll refund you 10% of the premiums you've paid in that time. I also received a free online legal bill. You got $160.00 for each policy. So have you got a, have you got a will in place already Tucky?
[7 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK, no, I'm getting that in place next week.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Oh, no worries. Have you?
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : So you've already umm, oh, OK, beautiful. Well, with this one, if you do, you wanna just if you're getting something already in place, that's fantastic, But if you do have a need to make changes, this one is gonna be sent to your e-mail. It's something that you can yeah use at any time site at $160.00. It is fully legalized as well.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : How much is it?
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Super easy to get set up uh, so that one is gonna come free with uh, the policy, but it's valued at 160 dollars. Yeah yeah.
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, so how do how do I do that?

[9 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : That's part of the package. Yeah. You'll receive that for free. Yeah.
[9 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Now keep in mind you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. So please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside of the 30 days, your couple will stop. You'll not receive anything back unless you're eligible for and choose the early cash back option. But Kathy, what I can do for you today is get you immediately covered over the phone and I'll send out the policy documents for you to review. So you can have a sit down, have a chat with your daughters, let them know this is something that you're thinking about getting in place. The policy gives you a 30 day calling off. If you decide the policy is not suitable for you and cancel within the 30 days, you would receive a full refund of your premium.
[9 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : OK. So what's upfront the payment upfront?
[9 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So once the claim has been made in that time, OK, so yeah, there's actually nothing to pay today. We can choose the collection, our first collection date that's suitable for you. A lot of people like to choose it when their when their payday rolls around.
