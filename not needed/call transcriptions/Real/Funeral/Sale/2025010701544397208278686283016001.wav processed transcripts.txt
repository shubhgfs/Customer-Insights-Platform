[1 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : That took a long, a lot, a lot of time to process.
[1 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : And in that time, yeah. And they sort of said in that time it's advanced that bad like they've tried radiation, very heavy dosage, but nothing's working. So they just sort of said just did all the affairs in order sort of thing.

[1 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : And I was reading on the real insurance website the other night in regards.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK. No, take your time, no rush.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So I'm just taking a looking through my screenshots because I took sorry and I did notice something on there. I don't know whether it would apply to mum where she's already been sort of giving that terminal diagnosis and he hasn't got in effect yet. Something about a benefit amount paid in advance or something rather. Charmaine, I was just a bit confused.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : MMM, umm. What I'll do, I'll take you through all the information like a step by step process so you have some idea about how our policy is designed for your mum. OK, So what I'll do, I'll start off by creating a profile of her, so making sure the date of birth and the and the full name it. We do require that in order to provide you with the accurate pricing.

[4 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, that's correct.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Oh, you're beautiful. How is she doing in in terms of health? Like, is she like, does she need like this?
[4 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Not too good to be honest.
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. Yeah.
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Like there's she's got COPD, pulmonary fibrosis and I've seen his heart disease. She's got the stage 4 cervical and over cancer.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah, cervical cancer, Yeah. I'm so sorry that she's going through so much in terms of her health.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yes and yeah.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but but miracle can happen. Dylan, I always do believe in God as well. Sometimes prayer, some of the prayer can be answered. So keep on praying and hopefully she can take a miraculous recovery and bounce back to her normal life. Or as long as she can stay with you without the family members. OK.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that would definitely be good.
[5 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. Of course. Having a mom is such a blessing. I I lost my mom four years ago. But. But I know that she's there with me spiritually because mom let they never leave you alone.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yes, very true. I'm so sorry to hear about that.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK. That's fine. So, Dylan, what I'll do today, I'll take you through the policy information in terms of how the policy will be designed for your mom. And just a friendly reminder as well that all of our calls are recorded. Any advice that I do provide, it is generally nature and it may not be suitable to your situation. OK.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So do you want, have you ever looked into funeral cover for for yourself or for your mom in the past? Or is this the first time that you're making the inquiry?
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : This is the first time I've thought of yeah. Never really wanted to sort out face reality I guess, but I guess it's got to do it when needed outside.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : First time, Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's OK. Sometimes we don't, we don't, we don't understand until it's umm, we do really need the feel like of of the need, but umm, but thank you for the for the call today. I'm more than happy to go through the information and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me today. OK Sir Dylan, with the policy, it is designed to provide that cash benefit.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : The minimum amount is $3000 and the maximum is $15,000 that your mom she can apply and it will be paid up to the beneficiary when she passes away and the beneficiary she can apply from one to five people. She can not leave them down. For example, if she wants you to be her beneficiary, she can nominate you for the full amount. So when you pass away, you'll be receiving that money as a lump sum cash to take care of our funeral cost.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, Do you have a piece of mind as worthy lens the the cash benefit amount the beneficiary they can use not just for the funeral cost though, but also for any other final expenses. For example, if she leaves behind any medical cost, any medical expenses bill or any other unpaid sort sort of rent or any mortgage bill, you can use that money to pay the other expenses off too.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, you're welcome. So in terms of the benefit fee amount, you have a bit of range to go to for your mum. Between $3000 goes up to $15,000.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : What amount? Yeah.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : So I was actually saying to mum, she said she'd probably prefer to go with the maximum amount just basically there, help out with the financials as much as possible. And I just thought I said, well, if you rent the maximum amount, I guess it's the end of the day. Like that's more that I could use towards giving her a date and sort of funeral type of thing.
[8 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Of course, of course, to, to respect our final wishes as well.
[8 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : And yes, definitely.
[8 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Has, has she told you about anything like what type of funeral service she might want to have when the time comes, whether it's gonna be termination or burial? Oh, oh, oh, that's beautiful. Yeah, that's beautiful. That's a bit very beautiful thought. But the reason why I asked you that question, do you want because I can give you some of the funeral facts so you can some have some like some idea about how much the cremation of the burial service can cost your mom. OK.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : No, she did say she wants to be buried back in her hometown with like close to her mum because they were really close to the thing and yes.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So according to the government's management website, the private funerals, it typically cost somewhere in the region of $4000 for a basic cremation and it goes up to $15,000 for a more detailed burial service, OK.
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So Dylan, as you can see, getting cremated, it is generally less expensive, OK? Without getting buried, it is slightly more expensive than getting cremated, OK. Did you want me to start off with the $15,000 and let's see how we go in terms of the pricing. And if it's too much, you can lower it down to say 10,000 or $12,000. Do you think that would be a good idea?
[9 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes. That sounds wonderful, darling. Thank you.
[9 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a problem. So start off with the $15,000 and then we can lower it down according to your mom's or your personal needs. OK, beautiful. So in terms of the application process for your mom, it is quite easy and simple. Whether she has the the stage 4 cancer or COPD, it's not going to affect the application form. OK, We didn't go through any medical check up on her.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[9 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : The acceptance is guaranteed for your mom. Only two things that we check Dylan.
[10 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[10 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : First one is whether she is an Australian resident and the second one is age between 40 and 79.
[10 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[10 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : And I did take those two with you today. So you have a Peace of Mind that she's already approved and E eligible to take out the policy.
[10 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh. Thank you.
[10 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, You're welcome. And you have a Peace of Mind, Elaine, that you also can take out the policy for your mom as well. I don't need to speak to your mom as long as the premium it is going to come out from your bank account. OK.
[10 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's Yep.
[10 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : If the policy does sounding affordable and suitable to yourself, are you going to be the one who's going to take out the policy for mom or your mom's going to pay? Yep.
[10 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : I'll probably do like all the application side for her just because she's not very tech savvy and all that stuff either.
[11 minutes][Agent] : Hmm.
[10 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : I will we pretty much we both help each other financially when it's needed does so if on a week, fortnight or month or whenever it's done if she sort of doesn't have the money, I'll be the one to pay it.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Hmm, of course it does make sense. Mom is there to help you. That's what mom does. Yeah, of course. So the reason why I told you that, Dylan, because you I'm talking to you today. So you sometimes some people don't know that they can also take out the policy for 3rd party as well. So for the funeral insurance, you can take out the policy for your mom. I don't need to speak to her as long as the premium is coming off from your account. And in the future, if your mom, she wants to take over, she can change the bank account to her name and she she can continue to pay for the insurance for herself as well.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : But that cycle and if that makes sense, very good, very good, wonderful. Thank you.
[11 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Alright, you're welcome. So what I'll do, I'll quickly run you through some of the main key points that comes with the policy. One of the benefits your mom has with the policy is called an accidental death benefit.
[11 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[11 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : It means that if her death is due to an accidental reason, a $15,000 policy, it will convert to $45,000 so the beneficiary can claim the money on OK.
[12 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : And the second benefit your mom has which is called an accidental serious injury. Just so you know, if she was to suffer an accidental serious injury such as quadriplegia or paraplegia before the policy adversary following her 75th birthday, the benefit amount, it will get triple as well. So that $15,000 cover fund will convert to $45,000. So she can access that money towards her medical costs as well.
[12 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[12 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK Dylan, I'll run you through about the waiting period. Since we don't go through any medical record of your mom, we don't go through her medical check as well. So there is a waiting period involved Dylan.
[13 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[13 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So for the 1st 12 months, she will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only after.
[13 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : So pretty much like oh, sorry, go on.
[13 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : No, no, that's OK. And what, what question did you have, Dylan?
[13 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I was just going to so basically within the 1st 12 months. It's just only covers like accidental, but if if they passed away 18 months after, it's sort of accidental and natural course coverage, if that makes sense.
[13 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So since we don't go through any medical record of her, so This is why the policy has been waiting for you involved. So we're going to cover her. But for the 1st 12 months, she will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury only. And Dylan, after the first 12 months, she will be covered for death due to any cause. So once you check the waiting period, regardless of how she passes away, for example, it could be the medical reason of how she passed away, or it could be due to any natural death or due to an accidental death. We don't, we are not going to look at the reason why she passed away. She'll be covered regardless, OK?
[13 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[14 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Mm, Hmm.
[14 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : And my other question with that, that if within the first, oh, how would I word it, say for example, if like within the 1st 12 months, say if when he goes to see her specialist next, if they said, oh, Donny, you've only got probably say six months left to live. How does that come into effect?
[14 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Sort of thing dull, like, 'cause we don't know, but they can't sort of give us a rough time frame at the moment, like they're specialists with the cancer side of things, he said. Oh, I want to say you've got a year or two less, he said. But I can't, like can't mind read what the cancer does. Yes.
[15 minutes][Agent] : Yeah yeah, they don't want to give you give her an exact time frame to give that hope extra uh yeah, I completely understand where you're coming from umm but one of the thing I have one of my friend's mom, she'll also going through like radiotherapy and chemotherapy as well. Umm, I feel like a mental support is one of the biggest strand at this stage.
[15 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[15 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Like umm again, maybe umm yeah, tell her like she she'll, she needs to be strong to go through all the all the radiotherapy. I know it's not that easy to say that because she's the one who's going through that. Uh, but yeah.
[15 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Oh, definitely like, and she's not a very big bill, shall we say, like with everything going on the way to sort of shedding off a doll. Like my, my little 3 year old boy is almost as heavy as her, shall we say, like she's only 28.2 kilos.
[15 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Oh, awful thing.
[15 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : So my, yeah, my mate's 7 year old child is actually heavier than what my mum is.
[16 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Oh, it's because of what? What the medical treatment she's going through all the side effects of the radiotherapy. I think maybe it was. Do you think this is the reason why she's that, like losing the weight?
[16 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : So Oh yeah, she's just sort of shedding the weight, but not in a good weight type of thing. And it's.
[16 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I'm glad that she has you. I'm sure that you're looking after her the weight it should be, but thank you for doing that for Mom. OK, so let's.
[16 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no.
[16 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So Dylan, I'll, I'll be very nice and clear with you about the waiting period. OK. So as I said before, after the first 12 months, she will be covered for death due to any cause. OK.
[16 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[16 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : In addition, in addition as well, there is a living benefit included. In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding her policy for 12 months, if she was fast diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, we are gonna pay her that $15,000 amount in full so she can use that money towards things like her medical expenses.
[17 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[17 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[17 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep. Yeah, that is one thing.
[17 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that.
[17 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : I been trying to sort of give a definite answer on is like AI guess it's say a rough time frame, like expectancy sort of thing, just as we can sort of be prepared for it sort of thing.
[17 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : But like you sort of ask them and one says, oh, I wanna say a couple of years and I don't know whether they're just saying that giving false hope to make you sort of not stress. And then you talk to the doctor and he said, oh, I was telling patients that have had this same thing and they've only sort of they've been given 12 months, only this six type of scenario. And it's, yeah, definitely one of the most stressful factors of the whole thing.
[18 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Of course, of course is done certainly as well, but I hope, as I said first, I'm sending my career senior way and to your family hope she can take a like a miracle recovery. Who knows.
[18 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : We can only hope.
[18 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : And you had a exactly right. You had a question about the that you have read something online. You know, it's not about the terminal illness benefit, that question that you had that you have asked me before. I hope that answered that query as well. So for example, the terminal illness benefit something like once you hold the policy for 12 months, OK. And they, the doctor tells her, the medical practitioner tells her that she has the, that she has been diagnosed with the terminal illness and she has only 12 months or less to leave. Then she can apply for that $15,000 cash benefit to help her with the medical cost.
[18 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[19 minutes][Agent] : OK, so I'll retash that back again, uh, if you like. So in addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding her policy for 12 months, if she was fast diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less delayed by a medical practitioner, we can pay half the, we, we will pay half the $15,000 claim in full to book to help her with the medical cost to, so she can receive the best care possible.
[19 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Oh, thank you.
[19 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, what I'll do, You're welcome. So Dylan, what I'll do now I'll take you to the pricing, but am I being clear to you so far in, uh, in terms of the policy information?
[19 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yes, perfectly clear and understandable, Dale. Thank you so much.
[19 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : You're welcome. So Dylan, let's take you through the pricing. For the $15,000 cover fortnightly basis, we are looking at $40.82.
[19 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : That's so every two weeks, $40.02.
[19 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : That is every two weeks rough roughly about $20.41 a week, OK.
[20 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. That's, yeah, that's not too bad at all, Dale.
[20 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : And it oh, I'm glad and a couple of things to note as well that our premiums are level, which means our premiums are designed to stay the same as she gets older. OK.
[20 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Oh, wonderful.
[20 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : And and if you need more information, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website too. There's one option available. Dylan, I just have to run you through. Regardless, I hope your mom makes Mirac miraculous recovery. So at any time she turns 85, there's a cash out option available. So after she reaches 85 years of age, she can choose to end the cover by herself and we are going to pay her the 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. OK, so I'll take you back to the pricing again. Dylan, how does the $15,000 cover sounding with the fortnightly payment of $40.82? Is that coming manageable and suitable for yourself?
[20 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes, that'd be manageable. Darl, when was the first payment on that have to be done? Darl would it have to be done? It's just.
[21 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Good question, Dylan. We, we work in a direct debit system, OK, The first payment, you don't have to make any payment today.
[21 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Thank you. Yeah, just we are both only.
[21 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : I can push it up to 30 days for you as well, OK, OK.
[21 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Like I only get a carer's payment once a fortnight and mum only gets her disability support pension once a fortnight as well from Centrelink though, so.
[21 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : I can line up with the payday for you as well. So every fortnightly basis on that day that you get paid, the payment will be deducted from your account. OK, so Dylan, are you going to be the one who will be taking out the policy for mom? Is it gonna come out from your account?
[21 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Do you want it to come from mine or yours, Mum? Mum said. Could we take it from hers? If that's alright, Darl? Could she get paid before I do?
[22 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Of of course I can do that. But I do need to speak to Donna then and and she will be the main policy holder. So she is signing her signing the policy up for herself, if that makes sense.
[22 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Or do you want me to get him to take it out of mine? Mum? So it's and like when you get paid I'll just transfer. Could we do that though?
[22 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[22 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : What I'll do, I'll get it taken out of mine and when mum gets paid, because she'll be paid before I will, I'll just transfer that $40.82 from my her account across to mine and.
[22 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. He can do that. It's entirely up to you. And as I said, in the future, Donna can call us back and she can update the banking in under her details as well under her banking so she can pay for her own insurance because she's the main policy holder. OK. But at this, we can get the policy started by checking your banking details as well. So because you are the one who's checking out the policy for ma'am Dylan, I do need to obtain your full name, date of birth and some of the details. I'm going to ask you now. OK.
[22 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep.

[24 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Alright. Just a friendly reminder to Donna that all of our calls are recorded. Any advice that I do provide is generally nature may not be suitable to your situation.
