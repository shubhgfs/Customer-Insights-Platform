[1 seconds][Agent] : Welcome to Real Insurance. You're speaking with Cooper. How can I help?
[5 seconds][Customer] : Where are you, Cooper? I'm just been watching your ads on TV. Slightly interested in funeral insurance.
[19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I can help you. Have a look at that one. I just laid up some quotes here for you. Just to be able to do that, I have to pop in here a few details. So what was your name?
[31 seconds][Customer] : Bradley Charles Reid.
[35 seconds][Agent] : The and what was your date of birth?
[33 seconds][Customer] : Reid, 6661. Too old?
[44 seconds][Agent] : OK, 61 and no, not at all. I just got to double check your e-mail. Australia interested.
[56 seconds][Customer] : I hope so.
[57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no worries Bradley. Just going to let you know on my end as well, all their calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation.
[56 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I understand.
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, hopping into this one here.
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : I understand the what?
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Bradley, is it kind of first time looking into some cover or is it your first time looking into some cover?
[1 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Well, first time never.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, no worries. So what I'll do then I'll run through nice and quick just how the fuel cover works. And if you have any questions, feel free to jump in as well. While I'm doing that, I'll just load up the quotes here for us. We can go through multiple as well, get some different price points for you. So feel free to again, jump in if you have any questions. But yeah, pretty, pretty straightforward there, Bradley. So how it's how it works probably would have seen on the ad, just pays out a lump sum payment in the event that you pass away and goes to whoever you nominate as your beneficiaries as well.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Not a problem, No.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Those beneficiaries are nice and simple. You can just nominate up to five of those people to receive that money if you want to.
[2 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, the only one. Oh, nice.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : You could just, yeah, you could just do do one, make it nice and simple. Now with this beneficiaries as well, if you would have passed away due to an accident, we'll pay out triple whatever you're insured for to them.
[2 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I I watch.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So 15,080, that's 45.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, mate.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. I'm not that worried. I'll be dead, so won't really. I won't really care.
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Sorry.
[2 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Well, any extra money stay.
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : I'm pragmatic.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah well if it makes a difference any extra money does stay with your family, so it's not like it's going down the drain or anything. If it costs 10,000 to the funeral, you have 5 the extra sorry 15 the extra 5 stays with them. Yeah, for the 1st 12 months. Important part to note here, you'll be covered for accidental death and accidental series injury only. And after the first 12 months, you'll be covered for death if you'd any cause.
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : In addition, there is a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding the policy for 12 months, if you're first diagnosed with the terminal illness with 12 months or less a week by a medical practitioner, we can pay out your claim in full to help out with things like medical expenses. Now, the thing they probably suit with the premiums there. The others don't stay the same as you get older. So they don't go up as you age or anything like that. And also, any time after you reach age 85, you can choose to end your cover. We'll pay you 70.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Well, I'm better to reach 64, so let's go there. Stop.
[3 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, still a long while to go, but yeah, you could.
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : You'd think.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, you could choose to end your cover and we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. But I'm hopping into the quote there. Bradley, before we do, any questions for me so far or pretty straightforward?
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes][Agent] : No worries, let me go if you do. But you can choose anywhere from 3000 up to $15,000 of cover. What amount do you think would be suitable for this? You know, cost for yourself directly?
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : I don't know what what's an average funeral cost?
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yes, it depends on of course what you're wanting. Do you reckon you'd learn more towards a cremation or burial?
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Arkham Nation? Burnley.
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : All right. So according to the government's Money Smart website, private funerals typically cost somewhere in the region of $4000 for basic Commission, up to $15,000 for more detailed burial service.
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. No, I'm. I'm not.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So big range down depending on what you're wanting.
[4 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : I'm not make. As I said, I'm pragmatic. I'm not gonna really worry.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Everybody else has to worry.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Well, yeah, where do you think you'd want to start? And then we can always adjust it from there if you're leaning more towards the basic side.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : I don't know, basic $4000 or something, make it 5000 if I'm not going to worry about it. Yeah.
[4 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, if you looked at, if you looked at 5000, it'd be an Indi, sorry. It'd be a fortnightly premium of $16.77 per fortnight for 5000.
[5 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that sounds reasonable.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yes, around 8 bucks a week roughly.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's good.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : It equates to that sounds like it fits in the budget. Yeah, too easy.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Well, well.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Another thing is another thing is, well, yeah, those premiums are designed to stay the same as you get older, so it doesn't get progressively more expensive as you age or anything like that. Yeah, with the coverage. Well, if you haven't done your will just yet, if it is something you are wanting to do. If not, you can just let you sit there. Basically we give you a free online legal will which is valid at 160 dollars dollars with each policy. So it's not an upsell or anything, just comes with the policy at no extra cost. You can use that one.
[5 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Did you say $150.00 a week? Oh, OK, Sorry. Yeah.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : No $160.00 will W yeah, online legal will and also that you know, with it being an insurance policy, we do let you know as well. You may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. So please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So if you cancel outside within 30 days, your cover will stop. You will not receive anything back unless you are eligible for it.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : That's fine mate, that's fine.
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Choose early cash back offer and you can also find information and you can also find information about our premium instruction website. But what I'll do there, Bradley, I'll pop in here an address. It just makes me do the pop in to the next part. What state are you in there, mate? Claisen, what was your post today? Golcus 215 And what suburb was that one airport anyways? And what would the address be in Southport, Norman? No worries.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : QLD Delco 41 Five Airport, it'll be #3/ 44 Little Norman St., Airport 4215.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : SO3/44 anyways. Alright, no worries. Is that your postal address as well?
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's correct.
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : There too easy now what we can do there for you badly. Because yeah, it is sounding suitable to 5000. Basically it allows us to get you immediately covered over the phone today without you having to make any upfront payments. So that instead allows us to send out the full documents to you to review, come in by e-mail and post. So you get 2 copies. You can have a read over it. You've also got a 30 day cooling off. As well. So if you do change your mind for whatever reason and decide to cancel within that 30 days, you get a full refund of any premium you paid unless a claim has been made. And as I mentioned as well, there's no payments required today. You're allowed to line up with a day you select in the future. That gives you enough time to review those documents before anything comes out.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Oh, Audible, do me a favour. Don't give me an e-mail because I'm, I'm not that I was born in the wrong era.
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Prefer not.
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : If you give me a hard copy.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we can do that.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, give me a hard copy.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's easy. And double checking. They may be happy to continue. Yeah. So is there a date in the future that would be most suitable for you for the first deduction date, like a payday or anything like that?
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Like something on paper at the moment, yes, that would be. That would be this Friday.
[8 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : What would kind of be the most suitable this Friday? So that would be the 17th.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : And would you prefer to note down the Bradley, a account number like a BSP, an account or a Visa or MasterCard? What's easier for you?
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK, Now you want. OK. I'm not.
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So nothing will come out until Friday?
[9 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : I'm not really happy about giving over things that I suppose I'd have to. Can you give me a second to give me a card? There.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, no rush.
[9 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Hang on. Hello. What do you need?
[10 minutes][Agent] : Yeah, still here, mate, Either a Visa or MasterCard or a BSP account number, whatever is easier. No surcharge either way.
