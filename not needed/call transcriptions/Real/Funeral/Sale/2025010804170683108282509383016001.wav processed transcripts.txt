Now if you the event was to happens, just say you are insane and let's knock on wood and you know that happens overseas OK, because he's considered as a beneficiary. He could just give us a call to advise us of your, uh, yes, OK.
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : And then we'd go from our claims department would go through that with you.
[8 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : I've just got everything covered. I mean, I don't know how long I'm going to have to go to look after normal.
[8 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. No, no, look, I understand like like just to let you know, you do have a benefit amount of $10,000, OK? So like as I said, I, I don't want to, you know, like you know, it's always not good to talk about it, but in the event of your death, OK. But now we've got a beneficiary listed that is your fund, OK?
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Like he would just give us a call. Obviously he would not have to let us know, notify us of your death and then our claims team would walk him through it about how to proceed from there. But he's just as a beneficiary in in the event of that, OK.
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : How much would it be extra for me if I if I up to 15?
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So did you want to top it up? Is that, is that the question that you're asking?
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's just so I can leave in something.
[9 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, Can you just have a look first? OK. So I'm just going to look at a few things, alright, to see if you can increase it, OK?
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK. I don't know why I thought it was for 15,000. I used to be with someone else and it got changed and I went with you and I don't know why. I thought I'd put it for 15,000.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Alright, OK, so I'm just having a look at your policy here. OK, so you can keep your existing cover, OK? And then we can also, uh, basically sell you a, uh, new handover funeral cover for a increased amount or canceling the existing cover and replace, uh, with a new handover funeral cover. So, OK, so like it, it's up to you what you would like to do.
[9 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, which would be the cheapest way they need to do?
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So like like like that, that, that would, that would be a top up cover basically.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Because if I can't, I just need to do a top up for him.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, Did you like I can put you through to our umm, our sales team or did you wanna maybe sit and have a bit of a think about it or.
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : I think I just want to know the the cheapest way because I think if I cancel my policy, I have to start from scratch, don't and then it'll just go because of my age, it'll go up.
[10 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's correct.
[10 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : So I yeah.
[10 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : It might go out like it is a sometimes it is a space, OK, So be like maybe a separate policy, OK, let me just check for you. So I'm just gonna place you on a quick hold, OK? I'll be right back. OK. I do apologize if no longer than two minutes, alright?
[10 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : So I think it I think it'd be cheaper if I just dropped up 5001 SEC That's alright.
[12 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much for holding there for me, Samantha.
[12 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : That's fine.
[12 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK, so now I'm going to transfer you to to our sales team. OK, They can discuss, umm, maybe a top up cover. So that would be another policy. OK, so you'd have two. All right, so I'll pop it to you then. But you can also discuss, you know, if you wanted to maybe cancel, start a new one, whatever. It does work best for you.
[12 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, but like just a recap on our phone call though. I've updated that beneficiary. You will receive a change of insurance at the end of in the mail, OK, which will have those details on there for you.
[12 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : That's lovely. Thank you. Thanks for your help.
[12 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK MMM, no problem at all. And if it's longer than two minutes, we'll wait, uh for a sales person. I do apologize.
