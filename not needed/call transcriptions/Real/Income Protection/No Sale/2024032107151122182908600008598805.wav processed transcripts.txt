[14 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[15 seconds][Agent] : Hi there. Right now it's Rob calling from real insurance. How you doing?
[20 seconds][Customer] : Oh hey mate, sorry it kept coming up as suspected scam.
[26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, and that's fair enough. Umm, the choice of working in a call center is that if we call someone and the number that uh, pops up, they don't recognize and they flag it as them, uh, it comes up for everyone. But I can assure you the only reason I'm calling is because we received your inquiry for life insurance at exactly 416 PM yesterday and we are not open on the weekends. So we're just trying to call up explain how the couple works and months or some points with you.
[56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, alright. No worries.
[58 seconds][Agent] : Cool. Sorry, can I just confirm we did receive your details here as Mr. Raina Summers date of birth. Sorry, what was that?
[1 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Lachlan, Lachlan Rain. Lachlan Rain of summers.
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. So you go by your middle name now.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : No, I usually go by my first name.
[1 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, sure. So is Lachlan spelled the standard Bay? Lachlan.
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : All right, and I've got your middle name as I've got your date of birth as the 20th of March 1998. Awesome. And you are a male and an Australian resident. Beautiful. Thanks very much for confirming that for me. While everything loads up, I do also need to let you know that all calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation.
[1 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : And umm, just so I can get like an understanding of your circumstances. I mean quite young compared to a lot of people I speak to, but what's actually got you interested in life insurance?
[2 minutes][Customer] : I need like a accident and illness policy. Yes, somewhat, yeah.
[2 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, so more like income protection, OK, because life insurance, just so you are aware, what it's designed to do is basically pay a lump sum to a nominated beneficiary of your choosing when you die, or basically if you were to be diagnosed with the terminal illness. Whereas income protection, umm, it is designed to pay a monthly income benefit directly to you if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[2 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So is that the one you actually meant to click on?
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, cool, no worries. Now, excuse me, let me just change the service income protection then, umm, basically the way that, uh, we work out income protection is we have a set of yes or no questions we need to ask you about your job and your health and lifestyle to determine how much we can offer to you and, uh, the like parameters of the cover. So when I say that's, umm, the, with the income protection, we offer an income benefit of 70, I'm sorry, up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from a minimum of $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000.
[3 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. Yep.
[3 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now, obviously if you're eligible for the maximum, you don't have to take it. If you just want to look at something small, that is completely up to you. And then, uh, if you're approved, umm, depending on obviously the terms we can offer you cover once in place, it will cover you after your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Umm, and keep in mind there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS. I'm happy to run through those for you if you need to. Uh, also the premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible, which can make it even more cost effective for you come and the financial year.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Does that all make sense so far? OK, cool. So before answering any of your questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all of our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact, uh, your cover at claims time. So may I first ask, uh, do you work 15 hours or more per week? Excellent. Is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment? OK, so that'd be no then do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle? Uh, so yes.
[4 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, it's mostly outside all of the above.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah. So heavy physical duties may include driving commercial vehicles, operating machinery, carrying, lifting, pushing, pulling or operating heavy machinery.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[5 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So you do that also. Excuse me again, are you qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role?
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[5 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. UMM do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew? Entertainment or sporting industry? Air Force, Army, armed forces or do you handle explosives? Excellent. Do you regularly work underground or underwater? Work at heights above 10 meters? Work offshore? Carry a fire Hart, excuse me, firearm or drive long haul.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. All righty. So that was the duties based assessment. So we're going to load this up for us now. Now, based on your duties, you can select A benefit amount anywhere from a minimum of $1000 up to the maximum of $15,000.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : So monthly.
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : What amount would you like me to quote you on by taking into account what you earn, Uh, like in terms of monthly? Yeah. How much? How much would help you out if you were sick or injured and unable to work and suffer loss of income?
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Oh damn, *** ****.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Uh, uh, we let we can always, uh, uh, like reverse engineer. Do you know what your annual income is before tax?
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. How much did you end before tax?
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : C Could we just like do about like 4 grand or something?
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, sure. Could do 4000. And could I please confirm with you, Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : No worries. All right, so if we're looking at $4000 here, I just need to confirm, uh, can you please confirm that the total annual income before tax is at least minimum of $68,600? Yeah. Is it at least or higher than that $68,600?
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : So my yearly wage higher than sorry, yes.
[7 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. Cool. All right, so we can definitely look at the $4000 for you. Umm now are you employed or self-employed?
[7 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's higher self-employed.
[8 minutes][Agent] : All right awesome. So pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts, less any business expenses and excluding superannuation contributions. This is the amount that the business would otherwise cease earning in the event you are unable to work due to a disability. Excuse me. So like I mentioned, we can uh, go up to obviously more if you need it, but I'm leaving it at less level $4000 for you as you requested. Now you have the option to select different waiting periods and benefit periods based on your circumstances. So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : You can choose either 30 days or 90 days, but just keep in mind that the income benefit you've paid in arrears, which means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first elevated with a claim and then every 30 days after that. Which waiting period would you like me to quote you on? Sure. Now the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. You can choose between six months to, uh, sorry, six months, one year, two years or five years. Which one would you like me to look at first?
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Just be 30 days one year.
[9 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Sure. All right. Now included in the policy is a rehabilitation benefit and it's designed to pay a reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit to a maximum of $3000 to help with the rehabilitation costs while claiming. Or you can choose that we reimburse up to six times your income benefit towards the cost of equipment or modifications required to assist your return to work. OK, There is also a final expenses benefit built in which pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away to assist with things like funeral expenses or other final expenses at that time. Umm, and then looking at this one for you. Umm, as you are self-employed, do you pay yourself weekly, fortnightly or monthly?
[9 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I'll pay myself monthly.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure. So would you prefer a monthly quote? Would that be best for you?
[10 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[10 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : All right, cool vents. Now looking at this one here on a monthly figure, you're looking at a premium of $109.24, which works out to be about $3.60 per day. Does that sound like it would be suitable to cover you being, uh, for income protection?
[10 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : So how, how much was it again? Sorry, 100. So I have to pay that.
[10 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So $109.24 per month basically, if you rounded up 110.
[11 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : I have to pay that a month.
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, that's fine.
[11 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. Now also keep in mind your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase as your age. So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year would go to $111.35 per month. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website.
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Alright. Thank you.
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : And no worries so far, is everything sounding all good? You understand how it's all going so far.
[11 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[11 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Excellent, excellent. I'm going to take you through these health and lifestyle questions because the final price and terms of cover are determined on the outcome. Before I do that, can I just confirm if we are able to get you approved, we'll get a copy of the policy sent out to you via e-mail and then a hard copy in the mail.

This adjustment will only apply with the total amount of the benefit payable plus the ongoing income exceeds 70% of your pre disability income. Righty. Umm, so that only applies where, uh, if you're still getting money from the business even though you're off. Umm, if you don't earn an income while you're off, then that's not applying to you, right? Because the question was, uh, would the business continue to make money if you were unable to work? So that's, that's in that regard. So where it's if it doesn't affect your salary, that's different. OK, awesome. Umm, and then there has been a slight payment change, uh, which is called a loading due to BMI. So with the monthly premium, this has come up to a total now of $157.83. This is something that can be applied to be reviewed in the future, but would that still be suitable? Would you like me to see if I can adjust something to make it a bit cheaper for you?
[26 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that's fine.
[27 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Awesome.
[27 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : I just, I just want a quote, that's all.

[28 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[28 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : And by all means take your time to review everything and, and see if it is gonna fit what you need.
