[42 seconds][Agent] : Yep, everything's all good bud.
[44 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah. OK.
[46 seconds][Agent] : Alright, no job for that. So yes, I'll let you know.
[49 seconds][Customer] : Got you. Yeah.
[48 seconds][Agent] : Again, all our calls are recorded and any advice providers general in nature amounts to situation and so you can proceed. Once again, can I get you to reconfirm your full name and date of birth please?
[58 seconds][Customer] : Eight of July 1986. Uh huh. Mm, hmm. Mm hmm.
[1 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Alright, good day. Thank you bud. Alright, so uh yeah, no, when we were speaking, we uh, we're noting down the details of the insurance. So, uh, prior to doing Li health and lifestyle questions, we're just going down umm, uh, things like the amount of cover necessary uh, and other benefit periods and waiting periods. OK. And umm, as I can remember, we're looking at $8750 uh, per month as the monthly benefit amount, uh, maximum based off your annual pre tax income. And now where we go on to well explain to you that we have different waiting periods and benefit periods that apply to the insurance.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : The waiting period being the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable of the insurance event.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[1 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So now like around this is in relation to when you actually make a claim on the insurance, OK, the options are 30 days or 90 days. And keep in mind the income benefits paid monthly in arrears. So if you were to say choose a 30 day waiting period, the first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible claim.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : 30 days, yeah.
[2 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : And it's up to you what's necessary if you need the income benefits sooner rather than later than yeah, perhaps 30 days work. O we'll, we'll work off that for you.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : What's the difference? What's the difference between 30 and 60? Is that?
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : 30 and 90 days are the two options. Now there is a, there is a cost difference.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Diane Yeah. Mm. Hmm.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Umm I'd also the exact difference because there are quite a few different factors that go into income protection color, but effectively 90 days is significantly cheaper on the basis that it is a longer amount of time to wait. OK. Otherwise, so I mean listen, if you do have things like savings or anything like that, that can just buy longer nine day waiting period, it would be cheaper, but obviously we can address that only if necessary. The other thing here though in the my look around is the benefit. The benefit. Is the maximum amount of time we'll pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So it's effectively the maximum amount of time that we could pay a claim to you. Per claim, the options are six months, one year, two years or five years. The shorter the cheaper and the longer the more expensive. And as six months being the shortest is the cheapest option here. OK, what? What benefit. Would you like to look at first though?
[3 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm, mm hmm mm hmm, I think show this one.
[3 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. It's about 6 months. No problems. Look off that for you then, mate. And so otherwise, umm, from here, then what I'm gonna arrange is I'll, uh, look help from last our questions. That way we can find out not only your eligibility for the insurance and the look around, but also terms of which we can offer you to cover, such as what the cost would be and other factors like that.
