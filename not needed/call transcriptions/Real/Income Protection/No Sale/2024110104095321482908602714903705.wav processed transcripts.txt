[23 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : So is it, can this be cancelled at any time as well?
[23 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So, uh, is it can it be canceled at any time as well?
[23 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yes. OK.
[23 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : The policy itself yeah you can apply to cancel the cover yeah, there's no cancellation fee. So it's $32 a fortnight, $32.66 per fortnight. OK.

[23 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And umm, just with the, if you become six, umm, you get how much of your wage? Yeah, I'll just, yeah, go ahead. Sorry. You go Fin, you're finishing and then I'll come 5% of your wage or something. You get.
[23 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : And just with the if you become sick, you get how much of your wage, 75% of your wage or something, you get, Yeah.
[24 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So the way the income protection works is that if you are unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and yourself or loss of income, we provide a monthly benefit directly to you.

[24 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[24 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : And as I mentioned the last time, keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS and premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible, which can make it even more cost effective for you. So just let us know you can get in touch when the time comes.
[24 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.

[25 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Uh, you actually selected, let me just bring that up, 1500 dollars, $1500. And, uh, you chose a benefit period of 30 days. Uh, sorry, a benefit period of six months and a waiting period of 30 days on this one. That's what you had chosen the last time.
[25 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, yeah.

[25 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[25 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, Say, for example, do you want to bring the premium down a bit? Yeah.
[25 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : That, yeah, that'd be great.
[25 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome.
[25 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yes.
[25 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So if I change the 30 days waiting period to 90 days, let me just have a look and see what the premium will be. OK, Just bear with me. I just need to jump into your application. So just to quickly explain as well, umm, and you did confirm the last time that you are employed at the moment, right? Yes.
[25 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yes. Yes.
[25 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK, so that hasn't changed so yeah, perfect. So the waiting period, remember is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event.
[25 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : No, Yes.
[26 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid in arrears. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So if you choose a 90 days waiting period, your first payment would be 120 days after you were first eligible to claim you. Every person has their own individual circumstances.
[26 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[26 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So depending on, uh, your sustainability, umm, so say for example, if you choose the 90 day of waiting period, let me just have a look and see what the payment comes down to. OK, bear with me. Yeah.
[26 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[26 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So keeping everything else the same, if you're bring, if you're extending the waiting period, then now your payment has come down to what it was previously, $16.48 for a fortnight. Is that better now? Yeah, it is.
