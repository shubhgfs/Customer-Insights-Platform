Any advice we provide is general nature, may not be said with your situation. Fur, can I have you confirm for me your details? Tim, your full name and date of birth please?
[23 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah. Timothy Michael Dickinson, 27, of the 5th, 1979.
[41 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic. OK, that's fine. So the income prediction cover there that you went through with Tim and what has come back here with a final answer. I'll just look into that for you. OK. So Tim, Mr. Tim Dickinson, do you agree to the following changes to your agreed quote for the following exclusion applies for Tim Dickinson in regards to the benefit of income protection. Now Income. No income protection benefit will be paid on in this policy due to any claims arising directly or indirectly from any disease or disorder of the left and or the right knee, including the joint muscles, cartilage, ligaments and tendons or related treatment or surgery. OK. Apart from that, everything else is still the same. So you're looking at paying $85.01 a fortnight and that will get you covered. So that's been approved. Happy with that.
[1 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, I guess so.
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Like, you know, had no trouble with my knees for the last 25 years and 100%.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I understand where you're coming from. But it's I guess because it's the previous, I guess preexisting condition that that happened in the past and that's the reason why that that happened. And the good news is you have been approved with with the exclusion there though in case.
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : So can I just ask a question?
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure.
[2 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK, just for argument's sake, just say I have a car crash and I injure other parts of my body as well as my knees.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yep. No, basically what will happen is that they they assess the claim, they'll be L looking to it and see what was it. What happened is the car crash you injured the parts of your body and then they'll assess accordingly. So we've been. Yep.
[2 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : He's gonna go oh sorry no, it's knees are there and that not covered no, but head injuries and all that and and knees are done as well because of the knees are injured.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Well, see, that's not my, my, my part of the department there. But I mean, what you're asking me is a claims question, which is, and it's always, it's, it's viewed case by case, obviously.
[2 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Does that mean it wipes the whole thing or well, because MMM.
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So in that scenario that you've, that you've just presented there, I would imagine what would happen is that they would assess that and understand it was, it was, it was an injury, not due to the knee. It was an injury due to a car accident. If that was the case. And then they'll, they'll assess that and see, you know, what, what, what parts of the body is injured and so forth. And I'll and I'll go according you to that. OK. So, but like I said, I mean that's that's, that's a a scenario where you've just presented me with with a is a quite a unique scenario there. But the we've got we've got.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : If you're in a car, car, there's gonna be multiple injuries.
[3 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I would imagine. Yeah, you're right. Yeah.
[3 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : But what I'm saying, yeah, if if there's one part of my body not covered, is that kind of what anything else like otherwise there's no point in me having any cover then if it's.
[3 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : No. Well, I mean for everything else you are covered. So you've you've got an exclusion for this and I'll just read that exclusion again. Just so it's clear for you, it's no income protection benefit will be will be paid by under this policy due to any claims arising directly or indirectly from any disease or disorder of the left hand or right knee, including the joint, muscle, cartilage, ligaments and tendons or related treatment or surgery.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : OK, that's that's any disease from that, but not injury.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So apart from that, Yep, yeah, that, that could that's, that's derived from from I guess that's right.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : So if I was to injure my knees it would be covered.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, the that's the I'll just repeat the exclusion again just so it's clear in your mind.
