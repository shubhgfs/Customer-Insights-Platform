[13 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : No, it doesn't mean HPV.
[13 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So HPVA, look, let me read you the definition of what hepatitis is and then you let me know if you've ever had this condition, OK?
[13 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, is the uh huh.
[13 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So just give us one second, OK? Won't be too long there. I'm just going to bring it up here, OK? Because we've got medical definitions here in generally, if you've ever had hepatitis, you probably know that you've had it in the past, OK? So let me just bring it up. So I have this four types of hepatitis. There's hepatitis AAB and C. So hepatitis means inflammation of the liver due to varying causes.
[14 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Umm.
[14 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So hepatitis A&A are viral but acute and do not have any lasting effects. Hepatitis B&C, however, are chronic in nature and can have long, uh, long term effects. These types of hepatitis can be transferred via blood. So for example, passed on from mother to child or as the results of unsafe sex or needle sharing. OK, so in that case with hepatitis, would that be a yes or a no?
[14 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I don't know. I haven't checked it or I I didn't notice.
[14 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So we're not asking if you've had a check, we EV we're asking if you have that, if you have, if you have ever had it or any symptoms of it.
[14 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : I don't know this answer well. I I'm not suffering any symptoms but maybe you said yes but I'm not too sure at the moment.
[14 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : But when you say I don't understand, Hon. So when you say you're not too sure. So because it's either you've had umm, you know, symptoms you've had in the past or you haven't generally. So it's one of those things with the hepatitis, you know, if if you've had it, then we'll have to put a yes. If you haven't, then we'll have then we can put a note for you. You have had hepatitis in the past.
[15 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Well, I don't think yes, yes, that's what I call me.
[15 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Ah, well, I'm not too sure. With hepatitis, 70% of people have it.
[15 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Is it like a 70% people doesn't have it W Well, look, I don't even fully understand why they don't have the tires you need, but let's call it yes because I'm not too sure.
[15 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Well, well, I'll just read you the definition of what hepatitis is. Hepatitis is that condition that I just read out to yourself. Harm, HPV.
[15 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, there's been HPVBHPV type, Yeah, HPV type B.
[15 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : HPV. What's HPV?
[16 minutes][Customer] : Yeah. Well, I guess we're, well, like both of them are. None of them are for doctors. So yeah, let's put it yes.
[16 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, so if you're answering a yes to that, then umm, then it's now asking what type of hepatitis have you suffer? Have you had or are you currently suffering from? Are you AB or C or got no other?
[16 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : WH, WH, WH. What's a fee? I think I I think I must have the general one. I could just get the general one. The none seem to be fine. Yeah.
[16 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, so look, if you're a bit unsure, because it sounds like you're a bit unsure about this question, what I need to do is you need to find out from your doctor may, if you, if you've even ever had it, because I'm not too sure what you're referring to. About 70% of people having hepatitis. Umm, you know, I'm not too sure about that.
[16 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Well.
[16 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So the best thing to do here, because the way that you respond to what could affect the outcome of the application to let you know, OK, so it could mean that you're approved or unsuccessful, or it could mean that you'll be umm, have an exclusion applied to it. So the best thing to do here, and like I said, with hepatitis on generally speaking, if you've ever had it in the past, you would probably know that you've had it. But I'm not too sure if if you're, if you're just like mistaken from for another condition or, or what have you. But what I can do for you so far is put this on hold for yourself for now. If you can find out from your doctor if you've ever had hepatitis, and if you have, then find out what type of hepatitis you've had.
[17 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I have California. Can you can you spell spell the word?

[18 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's right. Yes.
[18 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, so we'll put them there for you. That's fine. Now the next one is disorder of the liver, yes or no.

[25 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[25 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, So but besides that it is asking other than what you have already told me about in the past three years, have you sought medical advice or treatment by medical practitioner or specialist or you're awaiting results for any medical tests or investigations such as but not limited to any surgeries, X-ray scans, blood test or biopsy? Yes or no? And other than what you have already told me about a contemplating seeking medical advice for any symptoms or current experiencing within the next two weeks, yes or no? And other than what you have already told me about, have you ever during your working career required more than two consecutive weeks off work due to illness or injury? Yes or no?
[25 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[26 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. So three questions to go home and we're done. So the next one reads to the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family, living or deceased, ever been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, Huntington's disease, or familial eczematous polyposis? Yes or no and to the best of your knowledge of any of your immediate family suffered from cancer, heart conditions, stroke or other virtual disease prior to age 60, yes or no? And the last question, Hon, and we're done for today. Other than one of events, just certificate vouchers, do you engage in or intent to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fare paying passenger on a recognized airline? Motor racing, parachuting, machineering up sailing, scuba diving, day within 40 meters, cave or wreck diving or any other hazardous activity, Yes or no?
[26 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[27 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. So Hon, that's the end of the application. So what I'll do is have that submitted for your software. This will come back within literally just a few moments and letting us know what the outcome is for you. OK, So won't be too long.
[27 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[27 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, So hold the great news there is that your application is approved with the delayed terms and to let you know that the only change there was the exclusion with the irritable bowel syndrome, the IBS. So just a reminder again that my benefit will be payable under this policy due to any disease or disorder relating to irritable bowel syndrome RBS, including any complications arising from treatment thereof. So basically what I've explained to yourself earlier, OK. But besides that, there was no change to the premiums. Everything still remains the same at that $48.58 per fortnight. So now that you've been approved, the honk to get yourself covered.
[28 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, now have a second $48 per month.
[28 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Oh, sorry, per month. Sorry, my apologies because normally we, we normally hesitate for that per fortnight. So I do apologize. Sorry. That's the monthly right. Sorry, every month.
[28 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, so $24.00 per 4/9.
[28 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK, so if you want to do it fortnightly, it works out to be slightly less than 24. So the fortnightly right is $22.42 per fortnight.
[28 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Well, it doesn't make a difference.
[28 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : What would you like to do it fortnightly or monthly then?
[28 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : 049 is fine.
