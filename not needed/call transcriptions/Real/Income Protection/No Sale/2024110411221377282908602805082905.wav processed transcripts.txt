[24 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So we're basing it off when you did the injury, uh, and it was six months after you got the, the, the crutches off and everything like that.

[32 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : I'll collect your payment details and read you out a declaration.
[32 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK.

[32 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[32 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So what we do, we look into the future because we could allow the time for the underwriters to, to, umm, to go through everything for you.
[33 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[33 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So, so looking into the future, is there a day that's, uh, that you would like to have your first payment come out there? Yes.
[33 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : This year, yes, most likely it will be on not October, but that's not November. Yeah.
[33 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : In November, well, the furthest I can push the first payment date is up to 30 days from today.
[33 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : 30 days from today. OK. Yeah. So OK. So does that mean it has to be next month?
[33 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yes, that's right.
[33 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Oh, OK. 30 from O34 October. Oh, ****. Yeah. So that's 20. That's 24th. Yeah.
[33 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So the furthest I can push it back would be the 30th of next month, the 24th, but that would be the Thursday there.
[33 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine.
[33 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. Beautiful. Now, before I do take down anything else, I did want to let you know there is a few other things that do come in this policy as well.
[33 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[33 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So I wanted to let you know that included in your policy is a rehabilitation benefit along with a final expenses benefit.

Umm, and as well, I wanted to let you know that your premium is stepped, which means it would generally increase each year as you age.
[34 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[34 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year would be S uh, it would be $26.69.
[34 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah.
[34 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : So, uh, it goes up just a little bit as actually, no, I'm wrong. It actually goes down.
[34 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah.
[34 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : So this year $26.83, next year is $26.69, and then again it goes down again to to $26.67 for the year after that.
[34 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Why does it go down?
[34 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[34 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[34 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So because, umm, because as, as you're of a young age at the moment, there is a little bit of a risk for you because obviously, umm, they'd be making umm, the decisions that being younger is a lot more riskier than people, uh, of an older age.
[35 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : That old I Yeah. Yeah.
[35 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : That's right. So no, it'll be the same for me as I'm only 24.
[35 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah.
[35 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : So yes, that's right. So as you do get older, it does decrease a little bit. And then as soon as you hit 30 again, it does then go back up again.
[35 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Anything goes up in your 30, OK.
[35 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : So, uh, yes. So, uh, I can actually say, sorry, it's 29, but it's also rise back up again. So back in when you are 29, it will go to $29.32 as an example.
[35 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : And then it just increases from there.
[35 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : That's, that's exactly right. Yeah.
[35 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[35 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK. Now from that you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. But I just wanted to ask, Luke, how is it all sounding so far? OK.

[36 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Well when it comes down to it, I hope you don't have to use it right now because because they it constitutes you having an injury on illness to stop work to then be able to receive this.

Hannover relies upon the information you have provided when assessing your application. That includes the information we initially collected from you to provide a quote. Hannover has set a target market determination for this product, which describes the type of consumers this product is designed for. Our distribution practices are consistent with this determination and you can obtain a copy on our website. I need to remind you of the duty to take reasonable care that you agreed to. Can you please confirm that you have answered all of our questions in accordance with your duty, yes or no?
[39 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[40 minutes][Agent] : Beautiful, and we may from time to time provide offers to you via the communication methods you have provided to us in relation to other products and services. By agreeing to this declaration, you consent to allow us to contact you for this purpose until you opt out.
[40 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[40 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : You can update this at any time by contacting us, but the accepted cover provides the following insurance cover for Luke Massimo, a monthly insured amount of $1800 with a waiting period of 30 days and a benefit period of six months. The monthly income benefit payable in the event of a claim may be less than the monthly insured amounts as your income benefit is limited to 70% of your average monthly income over any 12 consecutive months during the two years before you suffered your disabling sickness or injury. Now your income benefit can also be reduced if you receive other disability payments from other sources. There is a final expenses benefit of $10,000 paid to your beneficiaries if you pass away while your policy is in place. Now for Luke Massimo, uh, an income protection benefit, a loading was applied during the application process. By agreeing to this declaration, do you agree to any non standard exclusions or loadings placed in your policy and you understand they will remain in place for the life of the policy. You may request that any of these alternative terms to be reviewed at any time by calling us. Your cover expires on October 24th, 2063 at 12:00 AM. Your premium for your first year of cover is $26.83 per fortnight. Your premium is a stepped premium which means it will be calculated at each policy anniversary and will generally increase each year. Included in your premium is an amount payable by Hanover 2 GFS of between 37% and 51% to cover costs. Your premium will be debited from your nominated bank account in the name of Luke Massimo which you authorized the debit form and have provided to us. The policy documentation, PDS and FST will be mailed to you and if you have provided us with an e-mail address, your policy documentation will also be emailed to you today.
[41 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : None.
[41 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : You should carefully consider these documents to ensure the product meets your needs. You have a 30 day cooling off. When you may cancel your policy and any premium you may have paid will be refunded in full unless you have lodged a claim. There are risks associated with the placing policies as your new policy may not be identical to your existing cover. We recommend that you do not cancel any existing policy until you have received any review in our policy in full. We have a complaints process which you can access at any time by contacting us. All details are available online and in the documentation we are sending you. And the last two questions I do have for you here, just ask do you understand and agree with the declaration, yes or no?
[42 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[42 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : And would you like any other information or would you like me to read any part of the PDS to you, yes or no? OK. What information do you require there?
