[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, understood.
[1 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. Yeah, thanks. So we obviously spoke originally, uh, like late last month. And we spoke again, uh, a couple of days ago you mentioned, umm, yeah, on Tuesday you mentioned that you were happy with what we discussed, but you just wanted to look at a different amount, which we did go through the new quote for you there on Tuesday. If you mind me asking, were you happy with that? Were you wanting to find out your eligibility, see if you're eligible for the insurance? Yeah, sure. Yep.
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Tuesday, yeah, yeah, yeah, I, I just got AI just got a few questions regarding the if I choose for let's say the 90 day WI waiting period, can I, can I change it please for, for for the 30 days. Later on right?
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Y you, you want me to see what it'll be if, uh N uh, so you would not be able to no, because that'll be a, a different risk to change it, uh, at this same risk for the insurer. So with regards to the period, you can umm, so you can always reduce the benefit. So if you went for two years, for example, you can reduce it to one year or six months, but not the not, not the not the waiting period, correct?
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Uh uh, waiting right. So if I choose for five years, I can change for two years.
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Correct. Yes, you can always go down, but you wouldn't be able to increase it. So if you went for one year, you wouldn't be able then to apply to change it with two years or five years. What you would need to do in that scenario is cancel the policy and start a new one with the with the five years if you wanted to do it that way.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I see. OK. So any time for the exchange like waiting period as well, you will need to cancel the parking, start a new one.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Unless, unless it's it's not the basically it's if it's a higher risk for the for the insurer, then yes, it would need to cancel and replace. If it's not a higher risk, then you can always apply to change it as well. Subjects that we at the time.
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : What situation would a would a be a high risk?
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Let me let me find out for you. I'll pop you on hold just for one quick SEC. I'll find out exactly. So I'm not giving you any mistakes.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : OK, the OK, thank you.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, Sarah, I'll be one SEC won't be long. Zero yeah, thank you for your patience yeah, I quickly double checked with my supervisor because obviously want to do the right thing by you and by the company don't want to give any wrong information. Umm, but to answer your question, uh, you can apply to decrease, uh, sorry, you, you, you can always umm, so with the, with the periods, as I mentioned, you can apply, uh, with the, sorry, losing my thoughts here with the benefit, the benefit. You can always apply to reduce it. So from five years to two years or or, or or or lower in the future, you can always apply to do that. But with the waiting period, you can, you wouldn't be able to reduce. You can apply to increase it.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, Yeah, OK. So the way it appeared, I can't.
[6 minutes][Agent] : So for example, from 30 to 90 days, not 90 to 30, correct. But the waiting period you the, the period you can not the not the waiting.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Not the way it appears. And in order to change I will need to cancel the the policy.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Let me bring up correct, correct and re and and it's not a new one.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, understood.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : If you wanted to to change that now, I'll bring up the quote that we discussed on Tuesday for you. OK.
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Alright, Yeah, uh huh.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Can I just also confirm with you, since we last spoke and went through the duties assessment questions, has then have your duties changed in the past 30 days or do you now work less than 15 hours per week?
[7 minutes][Customer] : No, no, it hasn't been changed.
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Great. No worries. Awesome. 0 Thanks for that. OK. So the quote we looked at on Tuesday, we looked at a monthly benefit amount of $3500. We looked at the waiting period of 90 days and the benefit period of six months.
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : No problem, right? Yeah.
[7 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : That came to a total fortnightly payment of $21.57 a fortnight. For you, that's zero. Would you feel that this would suit your needs at this stage? It is comfortable and manageable for you.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Which one is this one? Say again, which one is this one?
[7 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yes, I've got here 3 1/2 thousand dollars monthly benefit. Waiting period 90 days and benefit. Six months. OK, we that's we, we do look at a few multiple ones. What what would you like me to adjust it to? Do you do you want to add 1 year benefit?
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : No, the last Tuesday we got a different one because I think this let me confirm, this is the one with already the the payment that I provided you, right.
[8 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Of 60,000, we've got it here.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : My yearly payment, yes.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Your annual income benefits, well, your annual income before tax, we've got it of 60,000.
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So you could choose the minimum of $1000 a month up to the maximum of 3500. And that's what I quoted you on.
[8 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Uh, yeah.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : And then I got here, you gave me a few different for, for 30 days waiting period.
[8 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yep. I'll. Yep, that's right.
[8 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : They have five years 9222 years 65 uh, 37 one year one year 50 uh, $50.00 and 59 cents 6 + 42 dollars and three cents. They know 90 day waiting period. They have five years $60.65, two years 3874 cents one year $28.32.
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep.
[9 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : So what I'm thinking of going for right now is. Yeah, because I see like you had me get only 30 days waiting period. It's very good, but I should just find it if I have.
[9 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Well, 30 days waiting period just means that you get your obviously your first payment sooner.
[9 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, I understand that. It makes if I have an injury.
[9 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Would you feel you would need it up to 30 days? Yep, sure.
[10 minutes][Customer] : Ah, yeah, yeah, I think it it, I have a, it happened like a a few years ago. I got my I broke my hands.
[10 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : It it was very handy to have.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : It would be very handy to have something like in 30 days, you know to help.
[10 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Of course. Yeah, well, you're using that as an example. You you didn't break your hand, did you say as an example if that was happened?
[10 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I broke my hand. Yeah, Yeah, I had a small fracture. Uh, I mean skateboard. Yeah.
[10 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, sure, no worries. How long ago was that, 2017? OK, sure. No worries. All good.
[10 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Oh, this was very funny because I feel like it was just two years ago, but it was in 2017 being a lot. So yeah, I'm thinking the six months, uh, 30 days.
[10 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, sure. Let me bring back up that quote again, just to make sure that it's all correct on my end. 30 days, six months, that comes to $42.03 a fortnight. If you feel that this one is best for you at the moment, it's comfortable and manageable, then, umm, the next step is we'll take you to your health questions.
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, yeah. OK.
[11 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : We haven't done the health questions as yet for you, so we need to find, yeah, we need to find out the eligibility. We've already gone through the questions regarding your duties at work.
[11 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Uh huh.
[11 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : That's been done, but let's go through the health section as well to make sure you're eligible. OK, umm, now just a couple more things because obviously, umm, we've spoken to a few times.
[11 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, sure.
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So I just needed to recap on a couple of things firstly, and then we'll go into the help questions for you.
[11 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[11 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : 0 Thank you. So just reminding you again that this will pay in the event that you are unable to work, you're disabling sickness or injury and you suffer loss of income. Umm uh, the benefit is up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000 a month. And it once it's in place, it'll cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. But please keep in mind that there are some exclusions that are that applies online in the PDS. Now I just need to ask again, have you had a secret in the last four months here?
[11 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK, no figure.
[12 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, sorry. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Sorry, not six months, 12 months. Sorry.
[12 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, I don't smoke.
[12 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Well done. Perfect, I'll ask again. Are you employed or self-employed?
[12 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Self-employed.
[12 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. So if you remember, pre tax income for a self employee is the is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. This is the amount that the business would otherwise cease earning in the event that you were unable to work due to disability.
[12 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[12 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, so we've got your pre tax income, there is 60,000 again. And uh, uh, as I also explained, based on your duties, we can offer you anywhere and, and on the amount you've chosen, you can choose anywhere from $1000 a month up to 3 1/2 thousand a month.
[13 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[13 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, once again the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the interest event. You can choose from 30 days or 90 days, but just reminder again that the income benefit is paid in arrears. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment will be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. OK, Yep, Yep. No 60 days until you get the first payment, because remember, it's paid in arrears. Even though you've chosen a 30 day waiting period, he gets paid in arrears by another 30.
[13 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : So explain, I think if I lodge, if I had lodged a claim today it would be 30 days once a day to get paid or uh, OK OK.
[13 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : So your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible claim.
[13 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Oh I see.
[13 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : If you went for 90 days, for example, the first payment will be 120 days after because it's paid in arrears by 30.
[13 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Alright I got it.
[13 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, good.
[13 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[13 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Now finally the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injured, illness and you could have chosen 6 months, one year, two years or five years. OK, Now just a couple more things. I'm not sure I, I mentioned this to you the last time we spoke. So that's why I just wanted to recap with you also included with this.
[14 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : So let me see.
[14 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's OK.
[14 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, Jimmy, can you repeat this last bit that you said? Was it about how many years? Yeah.
[14 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : What would you like me to repeat the benefit. Yeah, it could be for you the six months, one year, two years or maximum of five years.
[14 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Five years. OK, I got it. Yeah. OK. OK. Carry on.
[14 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, thank you. Now what I wanted to make sure that I also explained because I'm not sure if I did this last time we spoke, but there we also include with this insurance a rehabilitation benefit for you along with whilst you have this insurance in place, if you were to pass away 0, then we will pay out $10,000 to your family to take care of your immediate funeral expenses. That's our final expenses benefit that's also included for you.
[14 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[15 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK, Hopefully they, you never get to use it, but it's some Peace of Mind for you.
[15 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Well, yeah. What about what is this recovery? How does it work?
[15 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : The rehabilitation benefits.
[15 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : The recovery, Yeah, yeah. Rehabilitation, yeah.
[15 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah. So basically what this does, this pays a reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefits to a maximum of $3000 to help you with rehabilitation costs whilst you're claiming. Or we can also reimburse up to six times your income benefits towards costs of equipment or modifications required you, uh, to assist you to return to work. That's what the rehabilitation benefit is, OK. And I also explained to you that with this insurance, your premium is step, which means it would generally increase each as you age. But I do need to give you just an indication on what that increases. So I'll let you give you an idea what it would be for next year just so you can see the difference.
[15 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Oh, oh, OK, OK, OK.
[16 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, so keeping in mind that our premium projections are indicative only and assume you don't make any changes to a cover.
[16 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh.
[16 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So once again, if we base it on the 30 days and six months at $42.03 a fortnight, I'll just load it. Sorry, it's still just loading. It just takes a second. Sorry. It won't be much longer. It's going really slow. Here we go. As an indication, if you make no changes to your policy, your premium next year will be $43.93 a fortnight next year.
[16 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Next year.
[16 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, Correct. Next year would have gone up by about $1.90.
[16 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : And why is this? That's crazy.
[16 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : It's the way this the insurance is designed because the premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age.
[17 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I see.
[17 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, but you can also find information about our premium structure on our website if you want to double check that yourself.
[17 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[17 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : 0 So finally, if that's all understood and umm, now I've, I've clarified everything with you. The final step now is we take you to your health questions just to make sure you're eligible, OK? Because, umm, the, the quote could possibly be changed.
[17 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK, uh huh.
[17 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : There may be some additional exclusions all based off your medical history, for example, with your fracture on your hand that could impact the, the application. So we need to disclose all of that in the application for you and hopefully we can get you approved there.
[17 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[17 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, Umm, now, so I can bring up the questions for you. I just need to put in your address, please. Can I start with your post code and somewhere please? Sarah 2230. Thank you.

OK, so 0, what's happened here is your application needs to be referred to the underwriters for assessment, which is not a big deal. It's it's just in regards to the knee replacement. If you remember, there was about four or five questions I ask you regarding the knee replacement.
[34 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[34 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : All the underwriters want to have a look is they just want to have a look at your answers and then they'll come back to me with the final results. And Yep, that's fine.
[34 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[34 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Happy to ensure you or no, unfortunately you've been unsuccessful.
[34 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[34 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Generally speaking. Generally speaking, this should be fine.

[34 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : You've made a full recovery.
[34 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[34 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Umm, as you mentioned, it's you. You're feeling even better than it was before.
[34 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[34 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so generally speaking this should be fine. But obviously I cannot comment on the underwriters behalf.
[34 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[34 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : That's why we asked you about four or five questions about it and we put in as much information as we can in there. So they will read this and they'll come back to me with a final assessment. But I've been here for a long time Sir and from what you've told me this should be fine. It's not a life threatening condition so generally speaking it should be OK.
[35 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK.
[35 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Most likely zero. Once again I can't comment on the underwriters behalf but most likely what will happen is they may just accept accept you. However, that might be excluded for the for the knee, OK, because it is a pre-existing condition.
[35 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : What?
[35 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Alright, but again, let's find out. So are you happy for me to refer this to them for assessment for you?
[35 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[35 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : No worries. Now the only other change that's that's happened was the exclusion that I read out to previously regarding the self-employed business continuity. OK, Besides that, nothing else has changed. So well done to you.
[35 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[35 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : All right, awesome. So with regards to referring this to the underwriters, what we do for you is we obviously don't take any payments out of your account today, of course. Or will we just note down your preferred method of payment now and then We let you choose a day in the future when you'd like for the first payment to start. Once we end this call, I'll send off all your answers to the underwriters for assessment. And they're generally really quick to come back to us. We should hear back from them within the next hour or two, depending how busy they are with the result for you. OK. OK.
[36 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[36 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Now if it has been fully approved without any changes from what we've discussed, then I'm going to accept the policy on my behalf and you'll be covered with us from that point on. And we'll only debit out the first payment from your account on the date you've chosen and it'll come out each fortnight from there on on the same day. Everything then gets emailed and posted out to you. But if the underwriters have made a change, for example, as I said with that knee replacement, most likely they will approve it, but that that might just get excluded. If that is the case or any changes from what we discussed today, I will call you back and we can discuss those changes together.
[36 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[36 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, Because obviously I want to make sure that you're happy with it. I will only accept the policy on my end if the underwriters fully approve it without any changes from what we discussed today.
[37 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[37 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So once again, we, we just note down your payment.
[37 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : So Jamie, just one thing. So sorry.
[37 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yep, yeah, yeah, correct, correct.
[37 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : So you're gonna call me if they change the the criteria to cover me for such as if they had to exclude my knee.
[37 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : For example, like for example, correct.
[37 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah, OK.
[37 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : If they exclude the new or anything, any changes that we haven't spoke about today, I will call you back and we can discuss those changes because obviously I want to make sure you're aware of them before accepting the policy.
[37 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Sure. OK.
[37 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : I will only accept it if the underwriters approve everything from what we discussed today. No changes have been made. Then I'll accept it and you'll be covered with us from there on and I'll send it off to you. But as I said, most likely it will get approved, but I'm assuming that that they might just exclude you for the knee replacement. So that's just my experience. I'm feeling that's what will happen because as I said, you fully recovered from it. OK, awesome, awesome. Now in the interim. While you're actually let me just make sure of this. Yep. So, so firstly, if you're happy for me to refer this all to them for you.
[38 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK, hold on.
[38 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Now the commencement of your cover will be subject to final assessment by the insurer. If the insurer approves your cover without any changes, are you happy for me to record the acceptance of the policy now and then I'll send the for you information to your e-mail and to your and to your home address.
[38 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, please.
[38 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Thanks, Sarah. No worries. So once again, we'll go ahead then.
[38 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[38 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : And that you choose which day you'd like for that first payment to start because once again, if it all gets approved, we'll take out the payment on that same day you've chosen each fortnight, leaving a time to read over the documents to make sure you're happy. What day would you prefer? Where? Thursday, the 18th? Today. What day would suit you best? Yeah, sure. No worries. Let me bring up the calendar for you. Tuesday the 23rd. Yeah, Tuesday the 20th. If it gets approved. First payment on the Tuesday 23rd and each fortnight after that on the Tuesday. Happy with that.
