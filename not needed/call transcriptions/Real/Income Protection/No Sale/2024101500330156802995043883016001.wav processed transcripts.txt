[2 seconds][Agent] : Hello, Grov, it's Lee calling back from real Insurance. How are you today?
[1 seconds][Customer] : Hello, good. How are you?
[8 seconds][Agent] : I'm very good as well. Thank you for asking. I was calling today in regards to the quote that we were looking at for the life insurance just to help rehash this each and benefits, see if we can get you approved for cover, but so that I can help into that for you. Can I confirm please your full name and date of birth?
[28 seconds][Customer] : 25th July 1982.
[30 seconds][Agent] : How may I help you today? Perfect then just Please note all our calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is generally made sure may not be suitable to your situation. Now I can see here UMM that previously we were giving you a quote for the 500,000 of life insurance UMM as well as the TPD at 500,000 totaling at $102.72 per fortnight, correct? Does that sound correct for you?
[57 seconds][Customer] : That sounds correct. I have to see that way if I can get only TPD from somewhere because how much difference is going to make or if there is any offer going on which motivates me to join, you know, real income again and how sure your process of for any in if any, what is the process of anything happens. So I I don't know about I will have these few queries.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, well I know that I did send that out about a week ago so that you can have a look into if there was anyone that would offer DVD. So you didn't manage to find anyone?
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no, because I was still trying, trying to see, but yeah, that's what was taking the time.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : And.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : But The thing is that like this thing, this insurance is, is there any offer going on at the moment or no?
[2 minutes][Agent] : Well, there's not an offer per SE, but there is a benefit built in called the Real Reward. We're after the first policy anniversary, so after your first 12 months of cover, you'll be refunded 10% of the premium you've paid as a thank you for being a loyal customer and holding cover. So for yourself that would be a refund of $267.07 that gets paid directly back to your account that you used to pay for the insurance.
[2 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK, And I, I just thought I'll give it a try once and how, how, how smooth the process of real income is. I want to understand because I have a good and bad experiences in past with my car insurance. So some company like Alliance, they're very, very, they take lots of time, but budget direct. They're already prompt and they, they, that's what they do.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : None.
[2 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : So I want to know what is your, the process? If, uh, how smooth is your process?
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : OK, well of course our claims team is based here in Australia and is of course dedicated to working closely with your loved ones, an insurer to ensure that the process of axing your life insurance benefit amount is made simple and easy. So on average for the life insurance, we pay claims 10 days faster than the industry benchmarks. So with us at 70 days versus the industry benchmark of 80 days.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : No, let's not talk about life insurance. What about the other? Like I have income protection and DPD 5 I have. And then, uh, how, what is the process? Like, uh, if somebody gets injured or got any sort of, uh, you know, physical or mental or any sort of serious, uh, uh, illness or anything, then uh, what he has to do? What is the process?
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, so in terms of that, it'll be as simple as calling up our claims department to begin a claim, umm, that issue with the claims form and whatnot. I mean then yeah, so and then yeah, you'd supply our claims team with the claims form as well as well as supporting documentation. So that can be like something from a doctor, something like that. And again, the total and permanent disability, I can see you already have income protection with us. I'm an older policy, but the total and permanent disability that pays a lump sum benefit benefit in the event you suffer the loss of lean more sight or unable to work for a period of six consecutive months.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Independent existence. What is that?
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : And I'm not able to return to work in any field that you're experienced, educated or trained or if you were to suffer losses in and in existence is when that claim would be OK? Let me see if I can find the definition for that for you. But that means basically it would essentially mean being able to live independently.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK, being labeled to live independently.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So again, with that in mind, the 500,000 life insurance 500,000 TPD totaling $102.72 per fortnight. Would that be affordable and suitable for you? Go rough.
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : That's $272 only for life insurance and TPD, right?
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So it's $102.72 per fortnight and that's for life insurance and TPD.
[5 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : OK. And I'm paying for income protection. How much? 200 something. So that will bring to around 300 something.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : I'm OK. I'll double check what you've got for the income protection at the moment. OK. So I can see at the moment they're paying $208.98 for the income protection per form at the moment.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : And they what, what about the waiting period for PPE? How much is the waiting period?
[6 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So there's no waiting period for TPD. So that's cover would be in place straight away. So between.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK, just you know, I know I'll sort out my budget. I have I have to know if my come next week I'm getting any sort of a new contract or anything, then I will able to, you know, sort out this issue rather than taking it and then later not able to pay the premium or TN it's just falls down. So but I want to be sure. So I want to give it a one at least one weeks more time like the next Friday.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, we can certainly give it one week's more time till next Friday. But in terms of this one, the next important step from here, it's going to make sure that you are eligible for the cover because of course in terms of this one, unfortunately not able to take out life insurance and PPD.

You've had the best outcome possible because there's been no changes to your pricing or any all terms and conditions. So still the 500,000 life insurance $35 a fortnight and 500,000 TPD 6772 per fortnight totaling at $102.72 a fortnight for the life insurance and TPD. So you can grab from here of course.

[17 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK. We can certainly send through both, but I know that in terms of this one, would you mostly be leaning towards the 500,000 or the 1,000,000?
[17 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Awesome. That's something I would be very clear in next one or two weeks. So I want to want to want to just make up my money.
[18 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : OK. Well, the great thing with us is there are no locking contracts. So later on subject to eligibility, you can apply to increase or decrease your level of cover. But based on your current budget, would you be more so leaning to that 500,000 that we looked at?

[18 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK. Well, we can certainly just get something sent out for you today if you prefer. But alternatively, again, there are no locking contracts you can apply that potentially increase it to the million later on subject to eligibility. If you did feel that 500,000 level was affordable and suitable, we're able to help provide you with some immediate cover and of course send out all the documentation for this policy as well, just in case you do provide you with a 30 day cooling off. So if you decide the policy is not suitable for you.
[19 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't want to get into that thing right now because again you know like I am not able to when I call and it's not OK.

Well then as you cover has been fully approved, wanna do is e-mail your policy schedule for 500,000 of cover that's coming activation for the license TPD and I'll send you the 1,000,000 as well.
