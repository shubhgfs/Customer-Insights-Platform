I'll read that out to you.
[40 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : I don't need to do it again, OK?
[40 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So due to mental health, uh, you've noted 3 to 4 episodes. No benefits will be payable for any disability condition, dis disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to or arising from mental health disorder or illness, stress, drug or alcohol abuse. And with the premium part of it, uh, I need to let you know, I need to advise that the premium has risen and it, this is due to the BMI, due to health. So let me just refer back to that. So we were working on that amount that you chose earlier. So I also need to advise that the premium has risen to $45.30 per fortnight and the reason for that is to you to bear with me. I'll just bring that up due to BMI and the underwriting application, which means we are happy to get you covered and protected with those changes. Now I do understand the pricings have changed. Are you still happy with that or should I make any adjustments?
[41 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK, no huge increase. I can't afford that.
[41 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : That's fine. I'll bring it down a little bit. I'll just make some adjustments for you, Sophie, bear with me. Sorry. When I make adjustments, I actually have to jump back in the application. Bear with me, OK?
[41 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[41 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : You have given all the answers so I can actually do that for you now.
[42 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : No, I can't do that either. No, that's that's no point. That wouldn't even cover my that wouldn't even cover my rent and food for my children.
[41 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So what I've done is I've bought the monthly benefit amount, I've just adjusted down to $3000 and with the you need the OK wouldn't even cover my that wouldn't even cover my, umm, rents into Oh yeah, you did work that out, didn't you? Well, let me just bring it down a little bit, OK, Let me bring that up a bit then. Is there, do you think there is any, umm, option for you to work on the actually, let me just look at a few options, OK, And then you can tell me whichever is suitable. Bear with me.
[42 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Unless it's going to come down to $30 a week, there's no way I can do it.
[42 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Unless it's gonna come down to $30 away, there's no way I can do it.
[42 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : And but I need to have the 4000 cover.
[42 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : But I need to have fortnightly, you mean Yes, yeah. Sorry. 30 or fortnight?
[42 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, sorry. 30A fortnight.
[42 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So around 30 per fortnight is workable. Yeah, yeah.
[42 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[42 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[42 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : And I'm not going to get the cover that I need. It's not going to work.
[42 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : But I'm not gonna get the cover that I needed. Let's have a look. Let me see what options are available. And it's just when I go into the application, that's what I can see if there are any changes there, Sophie, so bear with me. So because you've given me an amount, I can work on that. And basically.
[42 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : And basically, and then the other thing is it's really frustrating.
[42 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : And then the other thing is, mm, hmm.
[43 minutes][Customer] : So you're not going to cover me for mental health issues and then because my weight is a bit heavier, it jumps up by $20 a fortnight. That's ridiculous.
[43 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So you're not gonna cut 4 extra 4 episodes in my entire life?
[43 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : And you're not even going to cover me for mental health like 4-3 or four episodes in my entire life.
[43 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : That's not really going in.
[43 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : That's not really very many.
[43 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Most people have back in episodes.
[43 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Most people have that many episodes. That's just ridiculous.
[43 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : I understand. And with that from it, yeah, with someone.
[43 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Basically, you have to be a perfect person that has never had a crisis in their life to get full cover with a good price.
[43 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So with the way you have to be a perfect person, but it's never had a crisis in your life to get full cover with a good product when it comes. Yeah, I understand where you're coming from, Sophie. Umm, and we do understand that things can happen for a person in life or personal circumstances.
[43 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, but but you've got to pay for it.
[43 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Basically, you've got to pay the UMM because you've had UMM crisis in class.
[43 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Basically, you've got to pay to be to because you've had crisis in your life. The risk factor.
[43 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : It's just that when it comes to income protection, because we have to look at your uh, health and lifestyle yeah. So say someone and I, I, I understand sometimes what may happen is if, uh, if you've had pre-existing condition and if that happens again, your reaction could be different.
