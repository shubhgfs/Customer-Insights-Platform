[1 seconds][Agent] : Hello, welcome to Real Insurance. You're speaking with Kayla. How can I help you today?
[7 seconds][Customer] : OK, well, somebody called me about a quote that I did Friday.
[11 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, beautiful. What I'll do? Let me just open this one up and have a look for you. Can I just get you to confirm your details? Just your first and surname and date of birth.
[22 seconds][Customer] : It's Rafael Dutra. It's, uh, 6th of April 2001.
[26 seconds][Agent] : Thank you, Rafael, I'll just have a look with you a moment there. Let's see here tried to give you a call. Oh, so this was relation to income protection there. So just give you a call just to see how we can help you go over the cover. No system pricing. Before I do that, can I just quickly confirm your gender, you're a male as well as an Australian resident. OK, beautiful. And what's might you start looking at some income protection on our website over the weekend?
[48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. I started working in a company that they they asked for that type of insurance.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Good job. What are you doing for work now?
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : I'm working in construction during some type of installation.
[1 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : All right, Yeah, I see. Gotcha. Yeah, Well, what I think what happens is that's why they're probably telling you to get income protection. Income protection is designed to provide a monthly income benefit paid directly to you if you're unable to work due to disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. But the money can be used to help your bills and your living cost if your salary is interrupted. So working in the construction industry at the moment, are you working at least 15 hours per week in paid employment? Yeah, so sorry. OK, So when did you start with your construction, umm, company?
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Oh, I've been working a long time, for one year and a half, but they asked like recently about this type of insurance.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, no, that's fine. And I'll take you through every step of the way with this one as well. So that way you understand the policy and then I'll also run through some processing for you so that way we can find something that's going to be suitable. Sir, I'll explain the next part of this. So with the income protection, we pay up to 70% of your monthly umm, pre tax income and that's from $1000 all the way up to a maximum $15,000 per month that we get you to choose from and it's very easy to apply. So what I'm going to do today is ask you some health and lifestyle questions over the phone to see if you are approved and then if so, what terms we can also cover. And once in place it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Now keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the product disclosure statement. Now what you also find with income protection, the what you pay to us, you can generally claim on your tax as well. I just want to let you know because that can make it even more cost effective for you. Do you have any questions regards to the cover so far Rafael? OK, So what I'm going to do next is ask you some questions in relation to your duties that you do at work. So before answering any of that questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Value to do so could impact your cover at claims time. So firstly do work 15 hours or more per week. You've mentioned that's a yes.
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah, no. Mostly outdoors.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in office or clinical environment, mostly outdoors, No problem. Do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle?
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : I carry stuff but not heavy heavy heavy, but yeah.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So OK, so I'll explain what heavy physical duties may include. So that's driving commercial vehicles or operating machinery. And then also heavy physical duties could include carrying, lifting, pushing, pulling or operating heavy machinery.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Does that apply to you? Yeah.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : And are you qualified skilled or semi skilled to hold the required licenses to perform your role? And do you work in any of the following fields? So we've got aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, army, armed forces. Or do you handle explosives? Do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at hotspot 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul? Thank you. Next question is a lifestyle question. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Plus, yeah, No, no, no.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Good job. That's what we want to hear. Well done. Are you currently employed or self-employed?
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : South Point.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, thank you for that. Now just to determine how much cover we can offer you, I'll provide you with the definition of pre tax income. So pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal assets less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. This is the amount that the business would otherwise face earning in the event you were unable to work you to a disability.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Umm, probably. It's a around 3030 thousand.
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So what is your annual income before tax please, $30,000 per year, is that correct?
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 30 to 40. It's a range from there.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Do you know what it was maybe the last financial years? Maybe we can record that. Do you know what it was the last financial year?
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Umm, probably no.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : No. Well, what, what would you be most confident for me to record down? Like because I can't put ranges there, I'd have to put it, I'd have to put an amount. So like are you wanting me to put for like $30,000 and your income before tax or what? What did you want me to put down for you that you're most confident with? OK, 45,000 for the year. OK, Thank you. Now, based on your duties that you do at work in your annual income before tax, you can apply for income protection from a month, umm, minimum of $1000 per month all the way up to $2625 per month. So if you were off work, what would be a comfortable amount for you to live on each month? Yeah, sure. Now next is the waiting period. So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefits payable after the insured event. So you can choose 30 days or 90 days. Now please keep in mind the income benefits paid monthly in a raise. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be six days after your first eligible declaim. Sorry, do you want to look at a 30 day waiting period there for yourself or a 90 day waiting period for you?
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : 45, 1000, 30 days.
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no worries. Now the last thing is I'll get you to choose from me is the benefit. So this is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So let's say if you were off work, umm, how long would you like us to cover you for? So you can choose to be covered for six months, one year, two years or five years. How long would you like us to cover your salary for? Yep, the minimum. Sure thing. No worries there, Rafael. I've got one more step that I have to do and we'll go through some pricing is we're going to take you through health and lifestyle questions over the phone today. So this is called to determine if we're able to offer the cover and if there's any changes, umm, then the final process determined on that. Come to. So what I do is I read out a umm, pre underwriting disclosure. It simply just outlines how to answer health and lifestyle questions and also explain our privacy principles regards to the insurance. And then we'll go through your questions for you to the phone today.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : 6 six months, OK.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So thank you. So it says please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes. We collect your personal information to provide insurance quotes. It should cover other related services. We will share this with your insurer may share with other Australian service providers for the purpose of administering your policy or handling claims.

[19 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[19 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : All right. Thank you so much for going through that there, Rafael. So just a couple of things. So your application just needs to be referred off to the underwriter just due to the broken thumb, which is completely fine. I've already read out the exclusion that it is hereby understood and agreed that cover will face under this policy if the life insured ceases to reside in Australia. Now it's generated some pricing key for you. So if we look at the monthly benefit of $1000, the waiting period 30 days and the benefit. At six months. Your fortnightly repayment is $7.48 every two weeks for you, so that's $3.74 per week for your income protection cover. How's that appearing to you?
[20 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yes, but my coworker will pay me annually.
[20 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Are you happy with that pay?
[20 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Is that possible?
[20 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : And you, Oh yeah, you could, of course you could pay it annually. So if you pay it off from $1.00, that would be $194.53 for the year.
[20 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : OK, alright.
[20 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, beautiful. So I'll just explain that your application needs to be referred off to the underwriter for assessment. So there's just a couple of other things I'll just explain to you and then I'll explain the next step further. So there is a rehabilitation benefit along with the final expenses benefit, which pays $10,000 in the event that you passed away. That's assisted with funeral costs. And also just want to let you know that your premium is stepped, which means it would generally increase each year as you age. As an indication, Rafael, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $194.39. And you can also find information about our premium structure, which is available on our website. Now the next steps is while it's being referred off to the underwriter for assessment, what we can do is refer off with payment. So essentially what that means is when the underwriters come back and fully approve you, you'll cover it on the day that they come back to us as well. What we also do is we issue all the policy documents to your address and send out an e-mail to you while the policy is being referred. So do you mind as a start? Can I just grab your home address there please?

[22 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[22 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. I found that there. All right, perfect. Thanks so much for that. Yeah, I'll just give you a piece of mind or something. So even though we we get you umm, so like we refer off to the underwriter when the underwriters come back and approve you, you don't have to make any upfront payments straight away. We just get you to choose when you want the full amount to come out as well. So let's say the underwriters fully approve you. When did you want to put your annual payment to be When? When would be the most suitable time for you?
[23 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, could you repeat? I didn't understand. Like when?
[23 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's OK, Because you want to you want to set it up annually, is that right? So you just want to pay the amount in one go? When did you want that to come through? What date did you want that to come through?
[23 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, doesn't matter for me.
[23 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Doesn't matter. You could.
[23 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : The the day that I that I that I can say and and like when I am approved, I can say, yeah, I can say the day that I'm approved.

Well, what I'll do just for security purposes while obtaining your card details, the call recording will stop and we'll recommend after we have collected your details. The. None.

Now I'm going to send out an e-mail to you while the application is being referred off to the underwriter. So your e-mail address, ivegotisborges3539@gmail.com mobile is 0458731720. Now, if they make any changes to what we've agreed on over the phone today, I'm not going to accept it on your behalf. I'm actually going to give you a call, umm, there as well. But let's say, for example, if the underwriters come back and fully approve your income protection cover, are you happy for me to record your acceptance of this policy now and e-mail you and post out all the policy documents?
