[30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, you are.
[31 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And date of birth as the second of the 4th 1973.
[35 seconds][Customer] : That's the one.
[37 seconds][Agent] : All good, thank you. Now just place note our calls are recorded. Any advice that provides general nature and may not be suitable to your situation? And could I confirm your course? Male Australian resident. Yeah, of course not a problem. We'll I'll take you through, get you some options and if there's any questions along the way, just let me know. And just so I have a better understanding, was the income protection new to yourself or do you have some current cover and place?
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't have any cover in place. I thought that I did, but I'm just going through all paperwork and I've just been through divorce, so having a look. And yeah, we did have it at one stage, but it was cancelled. So I don't know why it was cancelled, but yeah.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm, alright, OK, no problems with that. So just looking back into it. Well, I appreciate taking the time with us to look into it, umm, with you. And of course, any questions, just let me know that as it is designed, I hope you don't need to use it, but it's there to provide you a monthly income benefit paid directly to yourself in the event if you're unable to work due to a discipline, sickness or injury and suffer a loss of income. So any bills, living expenses, anything else, there's no restrictions around how that needs to be used either. Yeah, we do offer an income benefit up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from 1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. And it's also easy to apply for. So we have an application that it's done over the phone, which is a series of health and lifestyle questions to take you through to see if we can get you approved and if so, on what terms we can offer cover on as well. Now once in place. So the policy continues up until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. And just keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS as well.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep, OK, Yep, OK, it's only inside 65.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : And yeah, that's right. So umm, that's when the policy covers you up until.
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, whatever if I'm if I'm working longer.
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So, umm, we thought of umm, it just of course depends on the circumstances and it, yeah, do keep in mind that's in the maximum that we can cover you up until, umm, with our policy.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : I'm not with us, unfortunately. Umm, or not yet. I'm not sure later on that I might change, I'm not too sure. But as of now that yeah, with that income policy, the maximum that we can't offer is up.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : So you don't do 7075 or anything like that one else do it for longer?
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Umm, I wouldn't be too sure. That might do with other policies, but again, I wouldn't be able to comment with other providers. Umm, I'm not too sure elsewhere in that regard.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : What's the waiting?
[3 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Waiting period. So with the waiting periods you have options. You can select it. Umm, so with the waiting periods we offer, it's umm, so just a non payment period, you must wait before the income benefits payable after the insured event. So we can choose either 30 days or 90 days. But just keep in mind with the waiting periods, the payments paid in a raise so many if you choose a 30 day waiting period, the first payment would be at 60 days after your first eligible decline. So that's what we can offer you. Umm, Oh, thank you for your course. I get you some policy and I suggest that and, and play around it figures and adjust that to suit, umm, of course with you and, and did you have any other questions around that at all?
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : No.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, my line just broke up there. Could you repeat that one? Sorry.
[3 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : If I sign up now, they in two, almost three weeks time, something that so say say I sign up now and I pay now on this cover.
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : I've been setting this up before, so I don't really understand it. If something happened in four weeks or six weeks time from now, could I put a claim in a cover and that'd be covered?
[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, of course you can start a claim. You can basically start a claim safely, hypothetically take it out today, tomorrow if something wants to happen, if you'd suffer a discipling sickness or injury, I never to work, we start waiting for it. It's not from when you take out the policy, it's just from when the so the date the medical practitioner confirms you. I never to work due to that discipling sickness for injury 3 umm, So that can start pretty much straight away as soon as that umm, injury, illness, umm, occurs and that waiting period, it's just the waiting period, umm, you serve for that condition itself. Mm hmm.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : No, so I've just got to make you because I've been told to ask these notes from my brother because he's got it.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Uh, Yep. Umm.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Like I said, I've even set this up before. So what about loss of job?
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Loss of job, which we're done seeing that side of things is not something that we do cover with our policy.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yes, they're not lost as well.
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so mainly just say it is on if it was just due to like a deciphering sickness or injury itself, yes, a loss of job or redundancy, it generally wouldn't be covered with our policy. So 1 and I'm there was any other question we had around that?
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK, No, well, he's got, he's got red. I think she's one of the others that landline.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Mm, hmm. OK, yeah, yeah. Without a few, few differences between it, yeah, again, I I wouldn't be able to comment with other providers, but yeah, with assets, with the redundancy side of things generally not covered, umm, under that policy, yeah, umm, with that one.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK, well just finally through a cloak. Have a look at it.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm, yeah, mm, hmm. Yep, of course.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : I've got a couple of other and I'll.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no problems. I'll, I'll run you through some quotes to start. We can get some options around that for you. And also to to mention with the income protection policies, the premiums themselves are generally tax deductible as well, which can also help out and make it a bit more cost effective for you. But I'll run you through some questions around your duties at work and get some pricing to begin. And just before answering any of our questions, it is important to be aware of your duty to answer all of our questions actually and honestly. And finally, to do so, it could impact to cover claims times that, uh, do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, worth about 80 hours.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so definitely above that. And is your role administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment? Got you. So in that case, would that be, umm, is that mainly just the majority of your time indoors?
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : I'm general manager of the company, truck and trailer repair company, indoors and outdoors.
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Indoors, I've got you. And when would you or where would you spend the majority of your time? Would it be like the majority indoors or in that case, would it be outdoors as the majority?
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Well, it's in the workshop in the parts department in the office with the administrative staff, with the technicians out on spot sometimes. So it's I'm I'm all different areas.
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Between the two, where would you say you spend the majority of your time on average?
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : I'd say 35% in the office, 15% outside.
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yep, got you. So in between. So what I can do with the majority of your time indoors? That's fine. And are you required to perform any physical duties? And do you work in any, any of the following fields, which is aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces, or do you carry a firearm or handle explosives? And lastly, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[7 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : All good, no problems. I will. Based off that we can offer you between a minimum of 1000 up to the maximum $15,000 a monthly benefit amount and just depending on your pre tax income. And so at the moment did you have a monthly benefit amount you'd like to have a look at first?
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : It'll be around 15 K and one of the 200 KA year I'm employed.
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Got just around 200,000 per year and we feel and at the moment would you be employed or self-employed not a problem. So with your pre tax income for the title, annual renumeration paid to you by employer before tax and excluding super contributions and including salary and regular bonuses or or commissions.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 20,200 thousand. Sorry.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : And would you know your, your annual income before tax 20,000 Not a problem based off that what we can offer you because up to the maximum of 70% of that would be a monthly benefit amount of $11,666.00 as a maximum.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Umm, would you like me to start at that amount?
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Not a problem. I'll start there. And with your waiting period, so we can offer between the 30 days or 90 days as a waiting period. Now, which one would you like me to quote you on?
[9 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : What's the what's the difference? What does it do?
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So with the waiting period, say, I can give you a couple of examples, but with the longer waiting period, the premiums are generally lower and compared to the, the 30 days, umm, between the two, but I can start. So I'd give you an example of the 30 days and I'll switch it over to the 90 days and and of course, get you some options around that one as well for you. Yeah, umm, and also with your benefit. So the maximum amount of time we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury, illness, you can choose between 8:00 and six months, one year, two years or five years. Yeah, just for anyone. Injury, illness.
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Of paying the benefit so you can't blame it for good though. Yep. OK.
[9 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yes, So wouldn't be ongoing because if it's generally speaking with us as it is to find a family with the purpose of course if it happen, if you're returning to work thereafter, umm, so the maximum we do offer would be up to, to five years for anyone injury, illness, umm, but in that case, would you like to start at the, the five years?
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yep, absolutely.
[10 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : No problems, I'll start there. I'm putting up those amounts for you to need to adjust any of them, of course, just let you know that based off the monthly benefit amount maximum $11,666.00 a waiting period of 30 days and benefit period of five years, you would be looking at a fortnightly premium of $219.45 per fortnight for that cover.
[10 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Wow.
[10 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Just able to give you an example as well, say with the waiting period, if you get the rest of it the same to just drop the waiting period to 90 days and that would bring the premiums down to $137.84 a fortnight as an example as well.
[10 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : That's, yeah, yeah. But that's once you've got to wait.
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Oh, what was that?
[11 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, that's three months. You have to wait 90 days.
[11 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, yes. So with the waiting period would be 90 days and the first time in in that example as it is typing areas would be 120 days, umm, at that time.
[11 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[11 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So of course to keep that in mind we found did you have a preference? Would you like to keep it at the 30 or 90 days? 30 not a problem and we still benefit. They have options around that as well. Say as an example if you kept that for two years but still kept the 30 day waiting period and same monthly benefit amount, UMM would drop it to $148.67 UMM per fortnight for that one.
[11 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : You're on the 90 day.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : And all that was UMM, so for 30 days, but just dropped the benefit period to two years rather than 5.
[11 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK, I'll leave it.
[11 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Or was that just to leave it at 5?
[11 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : I'll leave it at 5. Yeah.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Not a problem. Leave that there for you. Umm, we do also give you a 10% cash back on that one as well. So following your first policy anniversary date, the 10% of those premiums you've paid into it is giving us a cash back to you as well. Umm, to mention umm, we do also include in the policies standard there's a rehabilitation benefit. So it's paying a reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit to a maximum of $3000 to help with rehabilitation costs whilst claiming or we can reimburse up to six times the income benefit towards cost of equipment or modifications required to assist or return to work as well.
[12 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and there's also a built in final expenses benefit which is paying out $10,000 in the event if you were to pass away. So to assist with feudal expenses or anything else made that that time as well.
[12 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK. Are you over the e-mail? That is correct.
[12 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, definitely I can get that sent off to you. No problems with that. Uh, in the next step for you would be to run you through the health and lifestyle questions as the final price in any terms of coverage determine all the outcome.
