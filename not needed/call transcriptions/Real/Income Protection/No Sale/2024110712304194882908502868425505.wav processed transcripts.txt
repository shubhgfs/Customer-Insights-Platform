So you know it's designed to help you cover your bills and living costs if your salaries and it's interrupted, you know they I've been in, you're unable to unfortunately work in relation to umm, if anything unfortunately happens, as I mentioned. So if you have a disabling sickness or injury, umm knock on wood that we definitely wouldn't want that to occur. But I understand that's why you're after the income protection insurance Is is for that Peace of Mind, is that correct?
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : In case something does happen, of course. Umm.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh. OK.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So what we can offer then is an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000.
[6 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yep, up to a maximum of $15,000, although we'll determine how much cover we can offer you by just finding out what your annual pre tax income is. So I understand you mentioned you've been there for maybe 5, not even six months. So I'll help you calculate if you need to, your annual pre tax income. So do you, do you know how much firstly you earn yearly before tax for your income?
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 30 something.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 30. Did you say 30,000 or 35,000? Sorry.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 30 something. I did pay day before.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Uh, yes, no problems. Is that before or after tax?
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Not like not remember.
[7 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Do you know how much you you would get on your payslip before tax at all? Before they tax you at all?
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Oh, 2004.
[7 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : 2400 before tax a fortnight, is that correct? No problems. The reason I ask you is because I can take that the 2400 a fortnight and I'll multiply it by 26 fortnights in the year so we can calculate what your yearly premium. Oh sorry, your yearly annual income is before tax. So it's I've multiplied $2400 by 26 fortnights which is giving me the $62,400 annual income before tax premium.
[8 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Are you happy for me to pop that in as your annual income before tax 62,400?
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Something like that.
[8 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. No, that's fine. As long as you mentioned the fortnightly benefit that you received $2400 before tax is correct. That's fine. I've calculated the annual income before tax for you and then we can generate the premiums from there.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : As to how much it'll cost for your, umm, income protection cover.
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Like that, like that gross pay or what?
[8 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, well I will determine as well if it's affordable firstly for you. So we can offer a monthly benefit amount of $3640 maximum. The minimum starts at at umm, $1000 per month.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : How much do you need between those amounts to get by? For example, if you just feel like you only need $2000 a month, we can I can quote you on that amount.
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, images like 34410. Yeah, so.
[9 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I can do 3 and 3640 as the maximum if that's OK with you that that's just based on your annual income before tax, that's how much we can offer. So I'll quote you on the maximum amount then 3640 if your annual income changes and you decide actually you do want. So if your annual income ever increases and then you are eligible to look at applying for something higher per month as you asked for 4000. You can look at giving us a call up to apply for review in relation to, uh, your eligibility. If you want to maybe up, apply to up your Ben, increase your monthly benefit amount. If that makes sense for you.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. All good here.
[10 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Does does does that No problem. But I'll start by confirming the, excuse me, the premium of this monthly benefit now for you.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Next is just the waiting period you can choose so I've been the waiting period is just a non payment period that you must wait before the income benefits fable to you after the insured event occurs.
[10 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[10 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So you can choose you've got two options to choose.
[10 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 30 days then.
[10 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : You can choose 30 or 90 days waiting period and I'll give you 30 days. Yes, sure, no problems. Uh, please keep in mind the income benefit, it is paid monthly in arrears. So that means, for example, if you choose a 30 day waiting period, then your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim.
[10 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, alright.
[10 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So the waiting period you'd like me to select was 30 days. And next, I'll just confirm you can also choose the benefit. So Ivan, what the benefit. Is, it's just the maximum amount of time that will actually pay the income benefit to you for anyone injury or illness while you're out of work. So you can choose six months, one year, two years or five years. The higher the benefit. That you choose, the higher the premium will be. So what what? What benefit. Would you like me to quit one first, for example? So do you want me to give you an example of what the benefit. Is or do you understand?
[11 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just give me the idea. Yeah, but I'm gonna choose them.
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yes, no problems, yes. So the benefit. Is just the maximum amount of time that in relation to if you were out of work and you had a six month benefit. For example, that's how long we'll pay you for. It's only 6 months if you choose A5 year benefit.
[11 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[11 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : That's how long we'll pay you for is five years until you're able to go back to work if that hopefully prior to that benefit. Running out, if that makes sense for that specific one. Injury or illness? Umm. So did you want me to quote you on maybe the six months to start with for the benefit.
[11 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll go there. Yeah.
[12 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So let's find out if this is affordable for you. If not, let me know and I can adjust the quote accordingly. Uh, so for the monthly benefit amount of $3640.00 with a 30 day waiting period and a six month benefit. The premium per fortnight is $149.56 per fortnight. So just under 150 bucks every fortnight. Is is that affordable or do you want me to make some adjustments to the quote for you?
[12 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's all good, eh?
[12 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Well, good, no problems. Uh, so if you're happy with that pricing, what we'll do next is we'll confirm your eligibility for the cover.
[12 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
