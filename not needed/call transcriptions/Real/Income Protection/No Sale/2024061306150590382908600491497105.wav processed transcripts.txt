So it's all your work is done above ground. Is that right? Only, is that correct? Yeah, perfect. That's fine then. So let me pop in your updated occupation here.

[1 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. So it's made that's the same money would have this dragon operator from the above ground. So just pop that in now go go. And you work at least 20 hours a week, is that right Bryce?
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yep, it's that's 86 I think a week.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Definitely much more last, a bit easier. If you get them done in less than 20 hours it'd be great. It's my dream. But what do you do now Bryce? With the income protection, if you're unable to work, it's due to deciding sickness and injury and you suffer loss of income. We'll pay you a monthly benefit directly to help you cover your bills and living cost whilst yourself interrupted. So obviously you know you get your bills in living costs as we all do. It can also be used to cover things like rent payments and mortgage payments. Did you guys have anything like that in place?
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep, we do. We have got income protection at the moment, but yeah, it's ridiculously big.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Ah, Yep, Yep, I understand. Definitely see where you're coming from. So we'll provide you a comparison to see whether it could offer you one with more value.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that'd be great.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Perfect so here your real insurance right price, we offer an income amount from $1000 up to 75% of your monthly pre tax income up to a Max of $10,000 a month. Simple to apply. There's no medicals or doctors appointments required. Just go into the health questions. The simple yes or no health questions. Regarding that one, can I please confirm if you are employed or self-employed? Perfect, so pre tax income means the total enumeration paid by our employee to you before tax. This includes salary, employee compulsory regulation, regular commissions and regular bonuses. Based on that, what's your monthly pre tax income?
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, in probably pre tax is per month I think. Whoops.
[3 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Well if you know yearly I can always use that, it's a bit easier as well.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : It's yeah, it's about 176,000 a year.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. So what I'll do, I'll divide that by 12. Divide by 12, which will give you the average monthly income as $14,667. Perfect.
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's about right, roughly.
[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. Now can I confirm that you've earned this level of income on average for the past 12 months?
[3 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Oh, is that sorry mate?
[3 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Can I confirm that you've earned this level of income on average for the past 12 months?
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I have.
[3 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. Now there's two other parts income protection, the waiting period and the benefit.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep. How many? How many days?
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : The waiting period is the non payment period that you must fight before the income benefits payable after the insured event. So you so you can. So that's the non payment period that you must say before the income benefits is payable after the insured event.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : You can choose between 30 or 90 days.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Oh, you can go 30. Yep.
[4 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Please keep in mind perfect. Please keep in mind the income benefits partners. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Based on that, which waiting period was it the 30 days?
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : I think So what? What else does that 30 day sort of change?
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : That's it. No, that's it. It's the price, the main, the main, I guess the main thing, it affects the price.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Nothing really does it Can can, can I get just the price on both of them?
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : 9 days generally cheaper than the 30 option obviously because you're waiting longer without receiving a payment for sure.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : So I'll, I'll leave it on the 30 to start and then we can always, always look at the 90 days if you want to look at that one as well.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Now with that in mind, once you've waited out the waiting period, the benefit.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Alright, Yep.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Starts the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone in due illness. So you can choose six months, a year, two years or five years. Which benefit. Would you have in mind?
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : So what does that sort of like, how does that work, mate?
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So that's, so that's the maximum amount of time that you get paid for that one in your owner. So say if you were on a six month benefit. If you've got to work for three months and you could go back to the last three months, we will pay for three months, right?
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Like, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : If you were to work for seven months, then you'd also only get paid for the full six months.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right, right.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Do you know what I mean?
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
