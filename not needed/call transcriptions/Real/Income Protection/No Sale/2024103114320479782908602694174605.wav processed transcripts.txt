[59 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, of course, no problems at all. So what I'd like to do for here is obviously just explain to you what we do provide here without income protection. Uh, we can jump into some pricing and see what it does come up for you there.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Now, without cover here, what it's designed to do is obviously provide a monthly income benefit paid directly to you if you were unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer the loss of income.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep.

So you do work a minimum of 15 hours per week and paid employment.
[1 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yes.

[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Now, very easy to apply, umm, all we do is just ask you some health and lifestyle questions over the phone to see if you are approved and if so, on what terms we can offer. And once in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Now keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply, umm, as outlined in the PDS. Umm, So what we'll do here just so I can jump into some pricing. I just have to do a very quick, umm, disclosure based, uh, assessment on your, uh, your, uh, your work there.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So with this one here, let me just jump into these. So base, as it says, before you answering any of that questions, it is important that you are a way of your duty to answer all our questions accurate and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your cover at claims time.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So the first question here just read, do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : And is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment?

Or do you handle explosives? OK. And do you regularly work underground or work underwater, work at heights above 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul?
[3 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : No, no, none of them.
[3 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. So let me just generate that one. So that's the treaty based assessment done. So let's jump into the pricing. So just to begin with, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : No.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Now in order for me to generate what we can offer you there, what would be your annual income before tax?
[4 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Last year it was 140. But it's it's different every year based on overtime, I think.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep. OK So what we can do is obviously can take it with your last pre taxable income.
[4 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep. No, Yeah, it was. Yeah, Yep. Yeah.
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : If that was 140,000 before tax, Yep, hundred 140,000 before TA but but before Yep, perfect, no problems at all. So based on your duties, you can select A benefit amount from $1000 being the minimum up to the maximum there of $8166 per month. So what amount would you like me to quote you on?
[4 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep, probably mid range.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : I think about half of that.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So I obviously what we do is we work in a $100 increment above 1000. So you can choose anywhere from $1000 all the way up to the maximum of 8166. So you can choose anywhere in between those levels. So is there a specific amount you want to be covered for per month?
[5 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think we'll just quote the Max.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : The Max certainly. I'll pop that one in for you there.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Can we, I can adjust it afterwards before we agree to anything, can't I?
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : All right, definitely. So what we can obviously do is look allowing that benefit amount down once we do go through all the, umm, through the assessment here. Umm, so umm, can I confirm if you are employed or self-employed?
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yep, employed. Yeah.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So pre tax income is the total annual uh, umm remunch and pay to you by your employer before tax excluding super contributions including salary and regular uh, income. Uh, sorry, regular Commission or bonuses. Now with this one here you the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured events. Now you can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid in arrears. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment will be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So which waiting period would you like me to quote you on there? We've got 30 days or 90 days, 30 perfect. Now the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. Now, uh, you can choose from that one, uh, with the benefit of six months, one year, 2 years and five years. So which benefit payer would you like me to quote you on?
[6 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : I think I'll go to 30, two years.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Two years, No problems. I'll pop that one in for two years, all right now with this one here, it's just, uh, loading up for me here. So with this one here, umm, if you're looking at a monthly benefit amount of 8166 with a waiting period of 30 days and a better, uh, benefit period of our two years, that one works out on a fortnightly premium of $105.75 per fortnight. And that's going to cover you there for what I have discussed just that.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK. I'm just looking for a bit of paper. So that was 100. OK.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : So $105.75 per fortnight, covering you there for $8166 per month with a 30 day waiting period and a benefit period of two years.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK. Can that be sent in an e-mail?
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So I can definitely arrange to get some information. OK.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : What I would likely to do is take you through these questions to check for your eligibility because these questions you do determine the final outcome of the income protection.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but initially their house is sounding. I know you said you maybe you wanted to look at lowering it down at the start. Of course. Do you want me to look lower than the 8166 for you? Uh, I think we'll worry about that after.
[7 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : I think we'll worry about that after.
[7 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK. So, umm, included in the policy is a rehabilitation benefit, which pays a reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit, uh, to a maximum of $3000 to help with rehabilitation cost whilst claiming, or we can reimburse up to six times your income benefit towards uh, the cost of equipment or modifications required to assist your return to work. Now there's also a final expenses benefit which pays $10,000 in the event that you Pennsylvania that you pass away. Now in regards to your premiums there, your premium is stepped, which means it would generally increase H or as you age, but is it as an indication if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next seat will be $108.31 per fortnight for that one there.
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Umm, Now let's jump into these questions that if you are accepted, what we're going to do is post all the information off to you there so you can sit down and obviously have a look over those documents there in full.
