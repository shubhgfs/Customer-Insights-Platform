[1 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, alright, that's fine. The only reason I ask is just with the health and lifestyle questions, we have a menu to pop it into the application. Umm. So it's just got you really thinking about what would happen if you out of work for a longer period of time, is that right? Yeah, of course not. Understandable. Well, what I'll do is I'll take you through some more information about how the income protection cover works. We'll go through umm, pricing. We've got some duty based questions as well. Umm, as I take you through it all, if you do have any questions along the way, you just let me know.
[2 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, perfect. Thank you very much.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. So the income protection policy that we offer, it's there to make sure you've got some protection if you were unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you would have suffered a loss of income. Now we offer the income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income. So it could be anywhere between $1000 up to $15,000 and there are going to be some health and lifestyle questions we would need to take you through. Very easy to apply for, but it's to see if you're going to be approved and if so, on what terms.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : None.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : You can actually also cover. Now, once this policy is in place, it will cover you up until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. And also keep in mind that there are some exclusions, umm, that apply as outlined in the PDS. Now any questions before we go through the duty based assessment?
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Not that I can think of at the moment.
[3 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. All right. Now keep in mind before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly.
