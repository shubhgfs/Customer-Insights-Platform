[12 seconds][Customer] : Yes. Yes, that's me.
[14 seconds][Agent] : Oh, hi. How are you?
[16 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I'm good. How are you?
[17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, very well. Thank you for asking the reason of the call. It's just a bit of a courtesy call. I believe you spoke with a colleague of mine, Michael, roughly about 3 weeks ago in regards to some quotes for life insurance. We're just following up just to touch base and see if it's something you're still interested in for yourself.
[28 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes. We were interested in getting these.
[36 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[36 seconds][Customer] : It was just Christmas came and we've just been so busy.
[38 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
[40 seconds][Customer] : We were wanting our first quote that we did, I think it was for both of us, around $40 a fortnight or something like that.
[47 seconds][Agent] : Let me just jump back in. Just give us a new call. As I say, all our calls are recorded. Any advice? Providers general in nature may not be suitable for your situation and just for compliance, can you please confirm your name and date of birth?
[49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. So it's Elizabeth Roswell, 10th of May, 1990.
[1 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Thank you very much. And you are of course a female Australian residence, correct?
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. No worries. And I believe it was a quote for yourself and your husband, is that correct? Yep.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep, partner.
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Let me just quickly, ah partner, sorry.
[1 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, right.
[1 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Can you just confirm your partner's name and date of birth, please?
[1 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Daniel Patello, 4th of July 1989.
[1 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And Daniel is a male Australian residents. Great.
[1 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's right. Yep.
[1 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. No worries. Now just give us a new call. I just have to confirm. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Perfect. And has Daniel had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[1 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. No worries. OK. Now, so the quote you mentioned, so you said it was roughly about $40 per fortnight. Was that each or for both of you?
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : It was for both of us.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Sure.
[1 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : I think it might have been nearly $50 or something like that.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries because I'm just quickly having a look. It looks like the one Michael had saved in your profile was for $500,000 each, which is coming in at $101.05. So let me adjust that one. Do you remember what the benefit amount was?
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'd probably have it saved in my emails somewhere.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's OK. I should be able to work it out. Let's have a look. So, yeah, sure.
[2 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : It might have been 300,000 and then yeah, I can't remember.
[2 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK. No problem, because I'm just quickly having a look. Yeah, unfortunately, since my colleague Michael quoted you, our system actually updated. So unfortunately I can't reopen the old quotes to see what it was. Yeah, just having a look here. Yes, only 300,000 each. It's coming in at $22.79 per fortnight. We just double check the 500,000 each.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : And, and I think then we had the, we had the house and yes, so we had the house and the TPD. So I think we had maybe 100, a hundred for each one of those.
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Ah, yes, OK, Yep, that would that would explain it then. No worries.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Let me quickly add that on. So just while I do this, just to quickly refresh your memory on what's covered with our policy, Basically this cover, it's designed to provide that financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away, essentially choosing them that you'd like to be insured for. You can nominate up to five people as beneficiaries and then we'll pay that money directly to them when the time comes. Umm, it is a worldwide cover, so if you do travel, you'll be covered overseas. Once you are covered, you can be covered for life. And of course it is flexible as well, so you can always apply to make changes to the cover in the future subject to your eligibility at that time. Now the application process is basically just a few health and lifestyle questions over the phone and then that way if you are accepted and of course once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause at all. The only thing not covered is just suicide in the 1st 13 months. There is also a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover, which means that if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, in that case we would pay out your claim in full while you're living with a serious illness option. So this one is a lot. It pays a lump sum benefit in the event that you were to suffer something like a heart attack, cancer, stroke, or if you were to undergo heart bypass surgery as assessed against the definitions in the PDS. Main difference being it doesn't have to be terminal, doesn't have to be fatal. If you were to suffer one of those things, we'd pay out the seriously honest benefit just to help out medical bills, that sort of thing. Now you can choose coverage starting from $50,000 up to half of your chosen life insurance benefit amount. So I'll quote you on $100,000 for each. Now I do need to let you know with the serious illness option, there is an exclusion for any events. Sorry. Any insured events that become apparent before or during the first three months of the serious Illness option commencing will not be covered. Please also be aware that any payment made under the Serious Illness cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount. If you also purchase total and permanent disability cover, the TPD benefit amount will also reduce when you have a successful serious illness claim now with total and permanent disability. Just to confirm, at the moment you both work more than 20 hours per week.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : I'm not working at the minute, but Daniel usually does. Yep.
[5 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yep, OK, no worries. So with your, would you say you work less? Would you say you work less than 10 hours a week in that case?
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : I'm just on maternity leave at the moment.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Ah, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's fine.
[5 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : So when I do go back to work, I'll probably work maybe 12 to 15 hours a week.
[5 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure, No problem. Well, that is fine. I just want to make sure I capture it correctly. I don't want to make any mistakes for you. Actually, let me just quickly confirm that with my manager. I'll just find that out. I won't be one SEC.
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. OK.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Cheers. Thank you so much for holding. Yeah, that's fine. So for somebody who's currently on maternity leave for the purposes of TPD, in that case, you'll be rated, your occupation would be rated as a homemaker slash home duties. Once you have returned to work for a minimum of three months, you can apply to have your occupation rating reviewed to the occupation that you were currently doing at that time now. So just give them. So Daniel does more than 20 hours a week at the moment. Yeah.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And what was his occupation?
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : So it is a brick wire.
[6 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Please, no worries. Just going to quickly double check our occupations classifications. All right, So is he brick lazy before we qualify?
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. No worries. OK, just to give you a quick explanation, what's what's covered with our TPD? So with the TPD option, it pays a lump sum benefit in the event that you were to suffer the loss of limb or sight. Or if you were unable to work for a period of six consecutive months and you were not able to return to work in any field in which you are experienced, educated or trained. Or if you were to suffer the loss of independent existence. Now there is an exclusion under this cover for any intentional self-inflicted injury. Please also be aware that any payment made under the Total and Permanent Disability cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount. If you also purchase serious illness cover, the serious illness benefit amount will also reduce when you have a successful TBD claim. So the total and permanent disability, you can choose coverage starting from $50,000 each up to a maximum of your total, also your chosen life insurance benefit amount. So just to confirm, you're after a quote for the 100,000 each for TPD, would that be right? Yeah, perfect. All right. Well, to break it down, I'm so, yeah, I'm pretty sure you were correct with the figures you gave me earlier. So $300,000 each of life insurance, $100,000 each of serious illness cover and $100,000 each of total and permanent disability. You'd be looking at a total fortnightly premium for the two of you together of $48.12 about.
[8 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think that's it.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. Yeah, no worries. Were you happy with that level of cover at this stage?
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's the one, yes.
[8 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem. Look, if you're happy with that, it's a pretty simple process. Basically all I have to do is just quickly run you through those health and lifestyle questions, see if we can get you approved. Once you're approved, I'll organise to send you out all the documentation so that you guys can take some time to read through it in your own times, make sure that you're happy with it. Yeah, they're pretty much just yes or no questions.
[9 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : I won't take much of your time now, just have to give you a quick breakdown. Just for the record. So $300,000 life insurance for Daniel was $13.53 a fortnight, 100,000 TPD was $8.62 a fortnight, $100,000 of serious illness was $6.35 a fortnight. For yourself, the 300,000 life was $9.26 a fortnight, 100,000 TPD was $4.55 per fortnight, and $100,000 of serious illness was $5.81 fortnight, making the total fortnightly premium $48.12. Now, just because they're optional extras, I just have to get your confirmation to add them onto the quote. Are you happy for me to add both the optional TPD and serious illness onto the quote at this stage?
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no worries. Now the other part to keep in mind is that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year or sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premiums. However, it is optional, so it's up to you. You can opt out of this automatic indexation each year if you wish. I do have a premium projection tool here, so I'll give you a quick indication of what the increases look like. It just says here as an indication if you make no changes to the policy next year if you accept that 5% indexation. Sorry, my system's just froze. There we go. So if you accept the fights and indexation next year, the amount you're both insured for will increase to $315,000 for life, $105,000 each for TPD and serious illness and the total fortnightly premium would be $53.26. Or if you decline that fights and indexation next year.
[10 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : As an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, the total amounts insured will all stay the same as right now and the fortnightly premium next year, umm, if you make no changes to the policy would be $50.72 for the two of you together. But basically what happens is 30 days before each policy anniversary, we do send you out an updated schedule letting you know the new benefit amount and the new premium. So you'll have roughly about a month each year to re evaluate and work out what you want to do. Of course you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. Now I just want to confirm, make sure I'm doing the right thing by you. Is that all making sense for you so far? Perfect. No worries. Just for I jump into these questions, I'll just quickly update your profile. Can I get your post code please?
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, 3555.
[11 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Thanks very much. And what's the town or suburb there?
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : It's kangaroo flat.
[11 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : No worries. And what's your address there, please?
[11 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : 19 Jerry Bong Way Kangaroo flat.
[11 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : No worries. Let's find that one. There it is. And is that also your postal address?
[12 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Uh, yes, it is.
[12 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, thanks very much. I just have to read a pre underwriting disclosure and this basically explains why we ask these questions.
[12 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : It just says here please be aware all that calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes.

[13 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[13 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Thank you very much. OK, just one question I have to ask in regards to COVID-19. So it says have you been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the last 12 months or have you experienced any ongoing symptoms or complications associated with your COVID-19 infection in the last 30 days? Perfect, Thank you for that. Alrighty, jumping into the questions, first one says are you a citizen or permanent resident of Australia or New Zealand currently residing in Australia, yes or no?

Work at heights above 20 meters, dive to depths below 40 meters, use explosives or travel to areas experiencing war or civil unrest, or work offshore. And the next section is in relation to your height and your weight. Please be aware that I'm required to obtain a confident single figure measurement for each in order to continue with the application. The system does not allow me to enter in any approximate figures, words, or height and weight ranges. What is your exact height please?
[14 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm not sure.
[14 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. Do you remember what you were last time you were measured?
[14 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : I can't remember.
[14 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : No, no, that's OK.
[14 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : I have no idea.
[14 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : No, that's fine. Did you have any way of measuring yourself close by, like a ruler or a tape measure or anything like that?
[15 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Maybe I was like 5.4, whatever that is.
[15 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK. Do you mean like 5 foot, 4 feet in inches?
[15 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, maybe that's it.
[15 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, look, I'm happy to accept that if that's a confident answer, but if you're not really sure, we would just have to confirm it just to be safe. Umm, so you, you're not 100% sure what you were when you were last measured?
[15 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No idea.
[15 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK, no dramas. Look, I don't want to make any mistakes for you. Umm, what I'll have to do? I'll just have to put it on hold for the moment, but that's all right. I can always arrange to give you to call you back and make an appointment. So just to give you a chance to quickly double check that, umm, do you now the rest of the questions just ask, uh, have you, have you ever had any major health conditions in the past like uh, heart attacks, cancer, strokes, diabetes? Have you have any anything like that previously? Perfect.
[15 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[15 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : No worries. Yeah, we shouldn't have an issue getting approved. It's basically a matter of making sure we don't make any mistakes for you. But I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll send you out an updated copy of that quote to your e-mail address so that you can review it in the meantime. And I can always arrange to give you a call back another time.
[16 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[16 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : I'll be here for the next three days and then I'll be on leave for a week. Was there a better time? I can give you a call back this week.
[16 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, just whenever.
[16 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Whatever. OK. Umm, how? How much time would you need just to double check your height and weight?
[16 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I can do it now. I'll just get a Woolwa.
[16 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, sure. I'm happy to wait. If you want to check, that's fine.

Are you infected with or are you in a high risk category for contracting HIV which causes AIDS? Do you work as or do you engage this? Sorry. So see.

[26 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Whenever you're ready the, only thing we need you to do is just let us know who you'd like to leave the money to we'll. Keep that on file.
[26 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[26 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Umm, it's also going to include a free wheel kit, uh, valued at $30.00.
[26 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[26 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So if you haven't already, uh, you can use that to get your affairs in order.
[26 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[26 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : It does come with step by step instructions, so it is designed so that you can do it yourself if need be. Now, because you've been fully approved, we do start covering you straight away for safety just in case, but we don't actually take any payments at this stage.
[26 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm, Yep.
[26 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : What we do for now, just to get the ball rolling is just set up your preferred method of payment, but you can choose a start date in the future that works for you.
[26 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[26 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : However, of course, once you do review the policy, if there's anything you don't like or even if you just change your mind altogether, of course that's fine, you're not obligated to keep it. The policy does come with a full 30 day cooling off.
[26 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[26 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : As well now in this situation, so you do have the option of doing a joint policy or two single policies. So financially the price is exactly the same. But if you did a joint policy, then you would be the policy owner and only you could nominate beneficiaries. Where if I did 2 individual policies, you'd both receive your own working and you'd both be able to nominate your own beneficiaries. Would you rather do a joint policy or two individual policies? What would be easier for you?
[27 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Is it the same price?
[27 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it's the same price whichever way you go.
[27 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : So what? What was the quote for my individual one and Daniel's individual one?
[27 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, sure. Let me grab my calculator.
[27 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : And does he have to go through all the health questions as well?
[27 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yes, that's what I was just about to say. So I would have to speak to him to run through those health questions if he's available.
[27 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[27 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yep. But I'll just give you quickly give you the price, so. All right, so for Daniel it was $28.50 per fortnight. And for yourself, let's quickly add that up. So for yourself, it's $19.62 per fortnight.
[28 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[28 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So whether you go separate or together, it's exactly $48.12 per fortnight total.
[28 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : And if we go together, what's the difference?
[28 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So the difference is there'll be one wheel kit sent out with the policy and only you would be able to nominate beneficiaries because then you would be the second insured.
[28 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[28 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So essentially by default, you would be his beneficiary. And then you could nominate up to five people.
[28 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[28 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Whereas if you had two individual policies, you could both nominate 5 people individually. Like you could both choose five people each and you would both receive a wheel kit. In that case, it's up to you what you prefer.
[28 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, yeah, We might just do the individual ones.
[28 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, No worries.
[28 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[28 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : That's fine. Gotcha. OK, Yeah, fair enough.
[28 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So Cos we've got two children, so we would make them the beneficiaries and yeah, yeah, OK. Yep.
[29 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : No dramas. Let me just quickly update this. As I mentioned, the price is exactly the same whichever way you go.
[29 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep. Hmm. Mm.
[29 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : While I've got you on the phone, I'll quickly get yours organised and I'll do the same for Daniel. Might be one SEC. It's going to quickly transfer all the information over to his profile so he's at the same address. Just to confirm. Would that be all right? Yep. Easy.
[29 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes, Yep.
[29 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : All right, let's quickly update that. All right, perfect. Now just locking your approval status 1 SEC.
[29 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[29 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So just to reconfirm, so for yours, it was $19.62 per fortnight. You have been fully approved for that amount. Yeah, I'll just quickly confirm. So I'll just make sure before I generate the policy. I just want to make sure I've captured your details correctly. You have Elizabeth Rose Ball, date of birth, 10th of May 1990 and you are a female Australian resident. Is that all correct? So if it's no worries. So as I mentioned, we don't take any payments at this stage. We just so we can get the ball rolling. We just set up your preferred method of payment and you can select the payment date in the future that works for you. And of course, I can easily put Daniels on the same day as well. So they just both come out on the same day.
[30 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[30 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Did you want to set that up using a bank account or a Visa or MasterCard?
[30 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Might do the bank account? Probably, yeah.
[30 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Sure, Yeah, we can note that down. No problem. Was yours a savings account or a cheque account? Sure, no worries.
[30 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : I think it's check account, maybe my name.
[30 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Was that your name on the account or both your names Name. Sure. And just need your BSP and account number please.
[31 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I might hang on. Can you hold just one moment? Yeah.
[31 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, take your time. All good. None. None.
[33 minutes][Customer] : OK. Hi.
[32 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Hi, Hi.
[33 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Thank you for holding.
[33 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no problem.
[33 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Can we organise the payment after we've done all the questions?
[33 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : A an e-mail or did you mean Daniel's questions? Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, definitely. I can do that no problem.
[33 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah. OK.
[33 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Give me two seconds. I'll just jump out of this. I'll save that here. Ready to go. OK. So yeah, basically just have to run through the same details with Daniel. Sorry, it won't be one second. It's quickly jumping back into the other quote.
[33 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Can you hear your heart, that 177?
[34 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. Yeah, Daniel's whoops.
[34 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[34 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, If Daniel's available, I'll run him through the same questions.
[34 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, I'll put him on.
[34 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : And yeah, awesome.
[34 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : OK, thank you.
[34 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Thanks very much. Cheers.
[34 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Bye. Bye.
[34 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Oh, hi, Daniel. My name's Joel. I'm part of the life insurance team here at Real. How you going?
[34 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yeah. Good. Thanks stuff.
[34 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, very well, thanks for asking. As you're aware, I've just been speaking with Elizabeth in regards to some quotes for life insurance for the two of you. So she's just asked me just to to go through those details with yourself and see if we can get you approved as well.
[34 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[34 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Once you're approved I'll organise, get all the documents sent out. You guys have a read through and review now. Just going to say our first time speaking. As I've said, all our calls are recorded. Any advice? Providers general in nature may not be suitable for your situation. Just make sure I have your details correct in front of me. Can you please confirm your name and date of birth?
[35 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Daniel James Patello, 4th of the 7th, 1989.
[35 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yep, that's the one, thanks very much. And you are of course a male Australian residence correct?
[35 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[35 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, thanks very much. And have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[35 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : No.
[35 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, thank you for that. All right, I'll just have to quickly run through some details, Umm, and the quote that I went through with, with Elizabeth, just make sure it's all OK with you. Uh, then I'll quickly run you through those health questions so you can get you approved as well. Uh, yeah. If you have any questions along the way, please feel free to jump in and ask.
[35 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[35 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : It's, uh, basically with the life insurance, it's very straightforward. So it is designed to provide that financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. Essentially, you can choose an amount you'd like to be insured for. You can nominate up to five people as beneficiaries and then we'll pay that money directly to them when the time comes. The application process is basically just a few health and lifestyle questions over the phone. And then that way if you are accepted and of course once you decide to commence the policy, you will be covered immediately for death due to any cause at all. The only thing not covered is just suicide in the 1st 13 months. There's also a terminally ill advanced payment included in the cover, which means that if you were diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, in that case, we would pay out your claim in full while you're living. Now for the life insurance, the cover ranges from $100,000 up to a maximum of 1,000,000. We also offer total and permanent disability and serious illness cover. Just confirm, Elizabeth has asked for a quote for $300,000 life insurance each, $100,000 TPD each and $100,000 serious illness each. Is that all OK with you so far? OK, no worries. Just to give you a quick explanation of what's covered under total and permanent disability. Umm, I'm sorry, just to confirm, at the moment you're working at least 20 hours per week. Yep, perfect. And Elizabeth advised me that you are a bricklayer, fully qualified. That'd be right.
[36 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yeah, Yep.
[37 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yep, perfect. OK, so what's covered with total and permanent disability? This one pays a lump sum benefit in the event that you were to suffer the loss of limb or sight or if you are unable to work for a period of six consecutive months and you will not able to return to work in any field in which you are experienced, educated or trained or if you were to suffer the loss of independent existence. Now there is an exclusion under this cover any intentional self-inflicted injury. Please also be aware that any payment made under the Total and Permanent Disability cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount. If you also purchase serious illness cover, the serious illness benefit amount will also reduce when you have a successful TPD claim. So you can choose coverage starting from $50,000 up to your chosen life insurance benefit amount. So just to confirm, umm for the 300,000 life insurance for yourself, it was $13.53 a fortnight, $100,000 TPD would be $8.62 per fortnight. Now lastly, with the serious illness option, this one pays a lump sum benefit in the EV in the event that you were to suffer something like heart attack, cancer, stroke, or if you were to undergo heart bypass surgery as assessed against the definitions in the PDS. So you can choose coverage anywhere from $50,000 up to half of your chosen life insurance benefit amount. I do need to let you know that there is an exclusion for any insured events that become apparent before or during the first three months of the serious illness option commencing will not be covered. Please also be aware that any payment made under the serious illness cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount. If you also purchase total and permanent disability cover, the TPD benefit amount will also reduce when you have a successful serious illness claim. So the serious illness for yourself $100,000 cover was $6.35 per fortnight. So for yourself, the total premium was $28.50 per fortnight, and for the two of you together, the exact figure was a total of $48.12 per fortnight. Umm, is that all OK with you so far?
[39 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine.
[39 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Now just because they're optional extras, I just have to get your confirmation to add them onto the quote. Umm, are you happy for me to add the optional serious illness and TPD covers onto the quote at this stage?
[39 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[39 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yep, perfect. Now, last thing I have to do just before I jump into the quotes, I just have to let you know that the premiums are stepped, which means they will generally increase each year as you age. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premiums. However, it is optional, so it's up to you. You can opt out of this automatic indexation each year if you wish, just to give you a quick indication of what the increases look like as an indication if you make no changes to the policy next year. If you accept the 5% increase, your amount insured well for life insurance, it'll rise to $315,000 each. The TPD and serious illness will increase to $105,000 each and the total fortnightly premium would be $53.26. Or if you decline that $0.05 indexation next year, the amount insured will stay the same as it is now. And as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your fortnightly premium next year would be $50.72. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. Just to confirm, is that all making sense for you so far?
[40 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[40 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, no worries. I just have to quickly run you through those health and lifestyle questions. They're pretty much just yes or no questions. I just have to read a pre underwriting disclosure essentially explaining why we ask these questions. So to see please be aware all our calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes.

So it says, have you been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the last 12 months or have you experienced any ongoing symptoms or complications associated with your COVID-19 infection in the last 30 days?

Thanks. Thanks very much. Well, thank you for all those answers. Are you satisfied with the answers you provided? Awesome. No worries. Look, no surprises. Obviously you are also very healthy. So you have been fully approved and yeah, also no changes. Everything stayed exactly the same as what we spoke about, which is great.
[49 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Not Yep, Yep, Yep.
[50 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So that means, yeah, the total cost for the two of you has stayed at $48.12 per fortnight. Now I'll just let you know the process as well. Just like I was telling Elizabeth, I'm sure she's already told you, but just for the record. So because you've been fully approved, what we do is we send you out all the documentation for you guys to have a read through and review. We do send out 2 copies. So you'll receive an e-mail copy which will come through in about 10 to 15 minutes. The hard copy should arrive in about two to five business days.
[50 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : None.
[50 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Now in the hard copy, that one is going to contain the beneficiaries form. So whenever you're ready, the only thing we need you to do is just let us know who you like to leave the money to and then we'll keep that on file. It's also going to include a freewheel kit valued at $30.00, so if you haven't already, you can use that to get your affairs in order. It does come with step by step instructions, so it is designed so they can do it yourself if need be. Now, yeah, so we do cover you straight away for safety just in case, but we don't actually take any payments at this stage. What we do for now just to get the ball rolling is just set up your preferred method of payment, but you can choose a start date in the future that works for you. However, once you do review the policy, if there's anything you don't like or even if you just change your mind altogether, of course that's fine. Now the policy does come with a full 30 day cooling off. As well now, just because I'm in Elizabeth's profile, I'll organize her one. So I basically just have to nominate her preferred method of payment, read her a declaration, umm, and then she'll be covered. And then I'll just have to speak to you again and do the same for yourself. Umm is she's still available at the moment?
[51 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. If you want to just pass her over, sure.
[51 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : We think, we think you want to send that through the one bank account or that's it, but mine I'm guessing. Yep, apparently it's all coming out of my bank account. I've been told.
[51 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, yeah, easy. Fair enough. No dramas. Look at that case while I've got you here. I'll grab it off yourself.
[52 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Can I set it up for like bank the account number and BSB just just so it doesn't cancel every time I get a new card?
[52 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, definitely. That's fine. No problem. Alrighty. Just to confirm, do you have a savings account or a cheque account? Let me sure. And just for the record, that was your name on the account, correct?
[52 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, Yep.
[52 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yep, no worries. OK, and just need your BS bank account number please.
[52 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : So it's 633000. That's the best thing and just getting into it.

[52 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Account number is 119794196.
[52 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : 196. No worries. OK. And as I mentioned, you can choose when you'd like the payments to start, so I'm happy to to work around your schedule. When would you like me to schedule the first payment?
[52 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, it does not bother me, just whenever.
[53 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, All right. Look, I want to give you a chance to have a read through. How about if I push you back a week from today? Would that be all right?
[53 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[53 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Third of Jan, Easy. Push it back to then, just in case with the public Holidays Australia posters. So get slow in delivering it. Yeah, push back to the third of Jan. Now all I have to do. I'm sorry. Just to confirm for the record, so for Elizabeth's policy, hers was $19.62 per fortnight for the records. You give authorisation to debit from your account for this policy. Yep, perfect. And I'll just quickly make sure because I confirmed it with her. I know you're obviously living at the same address, I just have to confirm. For the record, can you please confirm your address with the post code please?
