[16 seconds][Agent] : Hi there, Peter. My name's Jan. I'm giving a call from Real Insurance. How are you going today? Sorry, it's just a bit hard to hear there, mate. So I'm very sorry Peter, it's just very difficult to hear you at the moment.
[33 seconds][Customer] : Yep, OK.
[34 seconds][Agent] : Oh, bit better there, so just saying. Yeah, my name's Jared. I'm giving a call from Real Insurance. I was just following up on the quote request that we received last night for the income protection insurance.
[45 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah. Yeah.
[46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So the reason for the call there, Pete, is just to take you through how the cover works, have a look at some different terms and prices, see what we can offer out for you. Just so I can load that up first, I'll let you know our calls are recorded and any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. Just confirm I've got your details here correct, mate. I've got your name down as Peter Descent, was it?
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yep, beautiful. And then date of birth, the 13th of the 10th, 1969.
[1 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's it. Yeah.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : And then lastly, just got to confirm that you are a male and an Australian resident beauty. OK, that's all the cheques out of the way, the approach check going for that as well. I'd love to ask Peter, what's got you looking into the income protection insurance with us recently?
[1 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Oh mate, I, I, I used to have, I had the income protection when I worked this to Matthew and now on my contractor they had the vines. But yeah, I don't have it so.
[1 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha, gotcha. So good. Obviously you've got a bit of understanding, you know, you've got a bit of knowledge in the past there as well, but now given you're out on your own, it is something I guess you want to have in case, you know, we don't plan on it. But obviously the worst to happen there, you know, unable to work, you know, need a source of income, of course, if you don't mind me asking as well. So working out of the minds, but now doing contracting.
[1 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, two years.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : How long have you been solo for Gotcha And enjoying it much more than I guess just being standardly employed.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Well, yeah, I'm still totally employed. So it's like, yeah, I'm on a roster, but I'm still under the contractor.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha. OK. So it's not, I guess too different. But I imagine there are some, hopefully some positives in there for you.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, that's right.
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no beauty, beauty. And how many have you been in that sort of industry for as well?
[2 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, I've been in the mining industry for like in the in the industry for 16 years.
[2 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha, gotcha. Look, from a lot of people I've spoken to, they say once you get in, it's very hard to get out because, you know, lifestyle changes, a lot of differences there. But I imagine you've enjoyed it so far over those years.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Well, what I was doing before was, yeah, a bit different to what I do now. And, and what a lot of them talk about in the industry, mining industry is, is, yeah, just sit on their *** driving truck, you know. Yeah, I don't do that.
[3 minutes][Agent] : Gotcha. What are you there specifically, if you don't mind me asking?
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : I'm, I'm in maintenance. Yeah. So we we look after draglines.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yep, gotcha. What are they?
[3 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. There's things that move a lot of dirt in a short amount of time.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Like a big yeah, no, dragline's a big. It's a big bucket and it's like a big crane.
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Like the I'm just obviously taking a while like kind of like a conveyor belt sort of thing or just like a right, gotcha, gotcha. Look, obviously my knowledge on, you know, mining all that sort of stuff is a bit slim there.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : But no, it sounds like a very interesting job. At least, you know, a bit more, I guess, mentally challenging than just driving a truck around.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Of course, no beautiful looking does something like that then you know, a bit. Not in this job, but oh, beautiful. And yeah. So what we can do for you here, Peter, just to let you know, kind of our process. I'll take you through a bit of info how ours works because it may be different to what you've had in the past and maybe what else is out there at the moment. Gotcha. When it does, yeah.
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : And I don't know, I, I don't know if I, I'd even be able to like if you could even be out of government because I've, I've had that, I've had ACL, Rico and I've had a, I've had a, a spinal fusion as well.
[4 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha. Look when it comes because we do of course I meant imagine amongst most has applications there. Ours is fairly straightforward though and based off of what you've told me it's not going to rule you out completely for the cover. But I don't think we are going to be able to cover those conditions as they're, you know, like a pre-existing condition in that sense.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yeah.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So, yeah, not ruling you out for the count in terms of the cover, obviously other things to be covered.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : But in terms of like an ACL, you know, reconstruction, those sorts of things, spinal injuries, they do get a bit tricky and hard to cover as it's already happened there. So look, kind of guarantee we can cover it, but happy to take you through. So what we can offer out in the end, Yeah, Beautiful. Well, yeah. So what we do, we'll go through a bit of info with you. We then go through a duty based assessment. So that's going to go more so off of what you're required to do at work, not just a job title. Makes it a bit more personal.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : And then from there we can construct the quote up, you know, pick an amount of cover, waiting period, benefit. Those sorts of things as well.
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Then we jump through the application to get all the final prices, final terms, see what we're working with from our end there. Now I'll start bringing this up where we are. I'll just load that in the background. Essentially the way ours is designed, Peter, it does provide you with a monthly income benefit that we pay out to you, of course, directly if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you do suffer a loss of income. So basically, as you know, it's there to help keep the lights on, food on the table whilst you're recovering, getting back into work, of course. And now we offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income. So it'd be starting from $1000 up to a maximum of 15,000 per month. Of course it is salary dependent, but I wouldn't be complaining if I was getting 15K in a month, I'd say that much.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 10.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Sorry.
[6 minutes][Customer] : Should I get 10?
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Oh, beautiful. Fire up. I need to change jobs I think. Got you.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. All right, No, look, I'm in the wrong industry, I'll say that much. But now with us, as I said, so we don't have to send you off to the doctors, you and I just go through some help and my stuff, questions over the phone to check your approval and if so, on what terms. We can offer the cover now once it's in place from our end. You're happy with it, it then protects you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. So long, long way away then.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, now keep in mind there are some standard exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS, but nothing you should have to worry about. It's more so, you know, engaging in criminal activity or things such as war, which hopefully aren't a weak in occurrence for you there either. So yeah, nothing in that aspect to worry about. Now you may know this already, but I just like reminding people or letting them know for the first time.
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : The premiums for Income Protection Day are generally tax deductible, so it can make it even more cost effective for you too.
[6 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Well, that's, that's why I was like when you tore it off and Oh yeah, that is that would be pretty good.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : And I I didn't know whether you'd be out of the.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : No, no. Look, we here given our application process, I guess, you know, we try to get as many people covered as possible. Of course, you know, one, it works out good for us, but two, we don't just want to turn people away, you know, based off of current circumstances, at least personally as well, I always like trying my best, seeing what I can do for people, going to the application, being in touch with the underwriters, such things there. So we'll see what we can offer out for you there, but we should more often than not have an outcome for you today. But that's all, basically the crux of our cover. I'll just double check. Do you have any questions for me at the moment, Peter, about how it works?
[7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : I've got a fair idea what I I have used things on protection something because the ones that you have didn't have that work well. We the one I broke my back and then started. I went with Charlie and I didn't age for them. Actually, I hadn't before them. But yeah, I know I've got a fair idea how it works.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful, OK makes my job much easier. I appreciate that mate. Now we'll go through the duties based assessment here. So these are all just yes or no responses and I just need to let you know that before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all of them accurately and honestly. Just As for you to do so could impact your cover at claims time. So the first one do feel silly asking because I feel like I know the answer already, but I just confirmed. Do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[8 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. And is your role sorry? I was going to say, yeah, look, I've heard a lot of people, they do more often 12 to 13 hour shifts in a day. So makes that criteria super easy. Now the next one here is just confirming, is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment? Sorry.
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, No, it will be. No, I don't know. I'm not in so well, yeah, not inside, but I don't know which one you.
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : No, no. So in that case, I guess, you know, based off what you've told me, we didn't. So no, because this is more so a job, you know, like mine here where I'm just sitting at a desk, you know, in an office, that sort of thing. Yeah, sorry, mate.
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's.
[9 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. Pop down a no. The next one just asks, do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle? Yep, and are you qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licences to perform your role?
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK beautiful and this one just double checks. Do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew, Entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces or do you handle explosives? So just a bit hard to hear there mate. One more time.
[9 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : No.
[9 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. And do you regularly work underground or underwater, Work at heights above 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul?
[10 minutes][Customer] : Sometimes I'll work about about 10 metres.
[10 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, when we say regularly there, this should be, I guess, a regular time interval, you know, daily or three times per week. No. OK, no, that's all right, beautiful. Pop that down there and that's all done and dusted. We can jump into the quote here. That just helps build the frame up for the quote Now, just as it doesn't transfer from online. I'll reconfirm with you mate. Have you had a cigarette in the PU in the last 12 months? No Beautiful, super healthy choice and a good way to keep the cost down of course too. All right, So what we'll do next is go determine the maximum monthly benefit amount that we can provide you with. So just give us a range to look between. We do that based off of your annual income before tax. So given that you're self-employed, I'll let you know what we classify as the pre tax income.
[10 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : I'm not self-employed. I I work for, I'm a cons like I work for a, an employment agency.
[10 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK. So would you then classify yourself as standardly employed?
[10 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I guess so, yeah.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, No, that's yeah. So more so like if it's like a self-employed coming under like a self sole trader, business owner, those sorts of things.
[11 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no one.
[11 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : No, no, no, that's all right. All right, we'll go underemployed there. So what would classify as your pre tax income? It's the title and your remuneration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and any regular commissions or bonuses if you get them, but excluding super contributions. Yeah, it doesn't have to be 162. Beautiful. Pop that in for you there and having a look. So maximum we could offer out to you there would be $9450 minimum being 1000 between those two figures there, the top and bottom. Where did you want to have a look at first, Peter?
[11 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : 100 and 162,000 8000 if I could or 77 to 8000.
[11 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : For your monthly benefit, Yeah, Yeah, Look, we can start at 8:00 at the higher end, obviously at that range. And if we need to, we can drop it down as well, but we'll pop it at 8 for you for the time being. Now the next thing will be the waiting period. So this is just the non payment period as you know, that must be served before the income benefits payable after the insured event. So we allow you to choose either 30 days or 90 days. And just to let you know that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So if you choose a 30 day. The first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible of the claim. Either 30 or 90. They're paid.
[12 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, the 30.
[12 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Which one did you want to pick, 30? Yep. And then lastly, just the benefit. I'm sure you know how this works. It's just the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. The options with us here are six months, one year, two years or five years.
[12 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. What I had before was two years.
[12 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, look, we can start going off 2 years 1st and obviously, we're price dependent. We can update that as well before anything's final. So pop it at two years. Beautiful. That brings up this here. So the next step, Peter, we do run you through those health and livestock questions, as I mentioned. So that way, it'll give us the price in any terms of the cover and we can see what we're working with there and obviously make adjustments as need be. It should only take us a couple of minutes anyway, so I'll have to confirm some other contact details. I've got your e-mail address here, mate. It's just Pete 8 66@live.com dot AU beautiful. And then just in case you do get approved, we do also require opt down a home address for you because we also like to have it sent out via post. What would be your post code first, please?

[25 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, that's fine.
[25 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. No, that's all right. We'll be able to disclose this under here with the follow-ups. I'll just have to quickly read out. Make sure that it wasn't sleep apnea, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or any other chronic respiratory disease.
[25 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[25 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : No. Beautiful. No, no, that's all right. So I'll pop down. Yes, that one here. Next question asks, have you required any treatment or used any medication within the last two years?
[25 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : I just asked them. Well, that's fine.
[25 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Asthma.
[25 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Or ask me. Yeah, I I guess I want a preventer.
[26 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha. Well, just like the the puffer, was it?
[26 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, it's, it's actually a Capital One, but yeah, just like the popper.
[26 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Oh, the tablets? Yeah. No, no, that's all right. Well, pop down. Yes, there. And then the next one asks, do you only use inhalers?
[26 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Well, yeah, well, that's it isn't inhaler, but it's a capital.
[26 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So do you like, do you take it as in like a tablet form?
[26 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, I don't take it. It's so it's in around, in around banister and you when you you open it, it cracks a it cracks a capsule and you suck in the powder.
[26 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK.
[26 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : No. Well, I do have a ventilant, but this one is Brion Alipta.
[26 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So I guess that like when it comes to it, that what we've got for as an example for inhalers would be like Ventolin or brick and all, if that rings a bell, similar to what you've got, right. Can I, if you don't mind, Peter, because I'd like to make sure these are done as accurate as possible for customers. Can I double check just based off what you've told me, if that would constitute as only using inhalers or if it would constitute as something else there? I'd just like to make sure it's all done correctly for you there.
[27 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, technically it's been higher.
[27 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : I was going to say you are inhaling it. Yeah, that's what just because obviously it's not like a normal inhaler, but it's slightly different. I'll see if it does constitute as inhaler for you, but I'll double check with the manager, see which way we can go for this one for you. OK.
[27 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Alright. Yep, that's it.
[27 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : No thanks. I won't be long.
[27 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no worries.
[27 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Cheers. Thank you very much for your patience there, Peter. So yeah, just confirmed with the manager we can classify that as an inhaler because you're still technically inhaling it. Yeah, No, that I just like to make sure because sometimes, you know, different types of medication, I wouldn't want it to be wrong for you. And then whatever reason, if there was a claim that, you know, reflected badly, but that won't be a worry at all. So pop down. Yes, for that one. The next one just asks, do you require more than one type of inhaler? No.
[30 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : No, I haven't used the.
[30 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Oh, gotcha. So you only require the preventer. Yeah. No. Beautiful.
[30 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do.
[30 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. No, No. Perfect. And then are your symptoms seasonal or exercise induced only?
[30 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Seasonal. Really.
[30 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, seasonal. We can pop that one down there. We'll answer yes to that one. And that captures everything for asthma. So we can jump back to the main questions at hand. Were we here?
[31 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : No. Well, I don't have any. I don't have any money. Yep. Yep.
[31 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So back or neck pain or disorder, what we, because I was going to say like with the, I know you mentioned the spinal injury, was it we should be able to catch because under like a back disorder or something like that. Obviously you don't have pain, but given a disorder, we'll be able to capture that one under this section here. That'll make it easier for the application. And then the next one asks, are you on restricted work duties or have limited my ability? No.
[31 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : No, No.
[31 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : And have you had also no, no. Oh, beautiful. And then have you had symptoms requiring treatment in the last two years? Sorry. Oh, sorry, Pete, I just lost you a bit there.
[31 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : No, it's not.
[31 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : No. OK, no. Perfect. And then did you have surgery to treat this condition?
[31 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[31 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yes. OK. Beautiful. And that captures all of that there. Great. That's one thing we'll tick off. Just like to make sure it's all covered. Now the next one's asking about arthritis, chronic pain, gout, repetitive strain injury, chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia. No perfect and joint or muscle pain, ligament injuries, including replacement or reconstructive surgery.
[32 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[32 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I was thinking this is where we can pop down. I remember the ACL, Rico, and you said something about your shoulder. I think, OK, beautiful. We'll be able to get those two down here. So the next one just asks, have you ever had any of the following tendonitis, elbow pain, shoulder pain, hip pain, knee pain, knee pain? Sorry, replacement or reconstructive surgery, Yes or no?
[32 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[32 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yes, beautiful. And then this is where I'm going to be able to enter into certain text fields as well. So this will make it easy. We'll go one by one. I'll just pop down the number one here. We'll go with the ACL 1st and then we can jump over to the shoulder and just re go through the same questions. So first one, please provide details including the name of your condition. I'll just pop in here. ACL reconstruction, if I can spell that. Yeah, there we go, beautiful. And then under one, next one's asking the joint or body part that's affected placed down. ACE. Thanks. You the right one, was it? Yep. Beautiful. Pop that in there. And then when did that, like injury slash reconstruction first occur? When was that? Sorry, I lost you there again.
[33 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[33 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Then 2008. Sorry. I do apologise there, Peter. So just to double check. I'm sorry, mate, it was 2008. Yeah, Yep. OK. Injury occurred in 2008 and you also had surgery in 2008.
[33 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[33 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. Also completed surgery. OK.
[34 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yes, me, me.
[34 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : And when were the most recent symptoms with Yeah, with the ACL?
[34 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : That was that. Haven't had any something.
[34 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : So since surgery it's been bounced back to normal.
[34 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Thank you.
[34 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. No symptoms. Perfect. That'll be good. Symptoms since recovered from surgery. OK. And what treatment did you receive? We'll pop down #1 surgery. Did they give you any physiotherapy to do? So I only did physio for three months after.
[34 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Three months afterwards, Yep.
[34 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yep. OK, sorry, I know I'm repeating basically what you're saying to me just so it's easy, if I can hear you say yes or no to what I've heard, that'll make it easy. So it's Sergio physiotherapy for three months after And did they give you any like painkillers or medication such like that?
[35 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Thank you guys.
[35 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Got you. So I didn't even use them. No, Perfect. I'll just pop you in here. Was given a kilos.
[35 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : I think that's really, I think there was a line if I got it alright, I give you an end down. I'm just trying to get off like in the back.
[35 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Got you. No, no, that's all right. I'll pop in misgiving pain killers, but client didn't use them. That will be good. All right. And just for the ACL there, did you have any time off work and if yes, how long?
[35 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : I I give the end down and it's in three weeks.
[35 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Three weeks, beautiful. Pop that in there. And what was the degree of the recovery there? A 100%. Beautiful. I'll pop that in 100%. OK. And then what we'll do this will just make it easier. We'll go back through the shoulder pain. So what happened with the shoulder then?
[35 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : 100% I dislocated with gold.
[36 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, gotcha. So that was just dislocated. They'd pop it back in place. Yep. Say what? Sorry.
[36 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, then they found that it is I must have done a bit of damage or a different table and they to me they went in different table, they did some surgery on it.
[36 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Oh, gotcha. No, no, that's all right. Easy. So we'll go to the same one there. Where are we? Dislocated shoulder details. There we go. And then just shoulder again. And then was it the left or right? Shoulder, Right. Beautiful. Seems to be a running trend there. They're only the right side to getting damaged. You wouldn't happen to be left-handed, would you? Oh, goodness. Yeah, no. So probably made it a bit difficult for the time being. No, that's all right. All OK. So.
[36 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm right with you, 2012.
[37 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : And then when did that first occur mate, 2012 beautiful umm injury occurs in 2012 and umm surgery completed in that year as well. OK, I'm just going to pop in here. I see a reconstruction that already in constitute surgery but just back up here just located umm shoulder client injured worse umm so required surgery. OK. And then when were the most recent symptoms for the surge after the shoulder?
[38 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[38 minutes][Agent] : Sorry, 2012 as well. Perfect. So I'll pop no symptoms so on basis copy and paste that one since recovered from surgery. Perfect. And in terms of the treatment received there again popped out of surgery. Do they give physio for the shoulder as well?
[38 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that was, that was actually a bit longer than me, a lot longer than we need because it was longer, longer recovery.
[38 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : No, that's right. How long did you do physio for there?
[38 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : That was that was six months for the witch holder.
[38 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Six months. Yep, that's all right. Six months after and then same thing. Do they give you painkillers but you just chose not to use them? Yeah.
[38 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, I didn't take it.
[38 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. No, that's probably the best way anyway. Just deal with it head on. Give them painkillers but client didn't use them. Perfect. And then for the shoulder there, mate. How much time did you have off work? Six months off work.
[39 minutes][Customer] : I think that was six months, yeah. By the time they, like they injured it and had to wait and did surgery and then the recovery for three months recovery.
[39 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Gotcha. So six months off work from time of injury until date of recovery. Yep. Gotcha. OK. So I was going to. Yeah, that's the next one. The degree of recovery.
[39 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : So, yeah, at the time I, I was working at Samantha's, yeah, Samantha mining mine machinery and we had to be 100% fit to go back to work, 100%.
[39 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : That was also 100% beautiful. No, Probably feels good as well. I can't imagine. I haven't dislocated down to my knee many, many years ago. I haven't done my shoulder. I can't imagine the pain in that one because you may imagine you move your arms a lot more. Sorry.
[39 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : It's probably the worst thing you can do is your children.
[39 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Probably the worst one. You could do it. Yeah, right. Well, God, I consider myself very lucky then. But no. Beautiful. All right, So that's everything we need to capture for those two conditions there. So we've got the ACL done, spinal done and shoulder done. It beautiful. We've only got.
[39 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : It's probably the worst one you can do with your children right there.
[40 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Sorry.
[40 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, what? What one that did be spoiling in 2017?
[40 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Oh, no. So that's all right. We won't have to do the back condition in this one because that's already captured in that other one that I got done before there. But beautiful. That's all sorted there. Now the next main question paid is just asking about osteoporosis or osteopenia.
[40 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : No.
[40 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Nope. And any defective hearing or sight other than which is corrected by glasses or contact lenses. No. Beautiful. OK, that's the biggest section out of the way as well. I appreciate everything so far there mate. We're almost done. This next one's asking other than what you've already told me about. In the past three years, have you sought medical advice or treatment by a medical practitioner or specialist? Or are you awaiting results for any medical tests or investigations such as, but not limited to any surgeries, X-rays, scans, blood tests, or biopsy? Yes or no? No Beautiful. Other than what you've already told me about. Are you contemplating seeking medical advice for any symptoms you are currently experiencing within the next two weeks?
[41 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[41 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : No. And then last health question for yourself, other than what you've already told me about, have you ever during your working career required more than two consecutive weeks off work due to illness or injury? Yeah.
[41 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : In my working career, yeah.
[41 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So only other than what you've already told me about. OK, no perfect. Because uh yeah, imagine obviously the your ACL back shoulder, that's all covered. This is anything that we haven't talked about.
[41 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : No, I had a pendicitis. I had an appendicitis when I was 16. I was work. I started work.
[41 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Oh God, we could actually capture that. Uh, where are we here? Umm, in where is it? This section here, I'm pretty sure. Let me just double check mate. Umm, I'll just have a look. Is it going to be on the list? Yeah, beautiful. So we've got one on the list here. So from what you've told me, appendicitis slash appendectomy with full recovery.
[42 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[42 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yep, beautiful. I'll pop that down there. And that's that sorted. OK. Yes, on the list. Perfect. All right, that's your health questions done there. We've only got 3 left in these. Next two are just a bit about your family's history. So this is only to the best of your knowledge. Have any of your immediate family, living or deceased ever been diagnosed with Polycystic Kidney disease, Huntington's disease or familial Adam Adomatous Polyposis? No beautiful and to the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family suffered from cancer, heart condition, stroke or other hereditary disease prior to the age of 60?
[42 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[42 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : No beautiful. OK, that's that there. And the last question, this is just how much of A thrill seeker you are. Just asking. Other than one off events such as a gift certificate or voucher, do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fare paying passenger on a recognised airline, Motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, AB sailing, scuba diving deeper than 40 meters, cave or wreck diving or any other hazardous activity.
[43 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : No.
[43 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So I'm on time mate, No thank goodness there as well. Sounds fun but yeah, a bit too dangerous in my opinion. All right, that's the application done and dusted as well. I very much appreciate your time going through that with me as well mate. So beautiful. The application, as I'm sure you would know there, Peter, it does need to be referred for a final assessment obviously to the under rowers. They can have a look at that for us there, there. There is only one below term that's popped up and that's just an exclusion for the back disorder we surgery. So I'll read it out. What it says here, it just says no benefit will be payable for any disability, condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to or arising from the spine, including its invertible discs, nerve roots, supporting musculature or ligaments. OK, beautiful. So as I said, given that it is a pre-existing condition, it is a bit of a hard one to cover. Look, obviously I don't make the decisions in the end, but just to give you fair warning, it may be the same case of course with the ACL and as well with the shoulder even though there is a full recovery there. But then again given how long ago it was, they may even consider that too. So I don't know exactly what they will say about those two there. OK, beautiful.
[44 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Oh, even even me back but within 2000 January 2017, I'd like it.
[44 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, even just I think more so because it is a back condition and it did have to be I guess the severity it was treated with surgery. That's just why they have chosen to exclude that there because it was a more severe one.
[44 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : That's one good.
[44 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : But look at any point there payday, you can always ring us up and apply to have these things reviewed if you've got the cover in place with us too.
[45 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[45 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Now that means we're actually able to have a look at sort of the final terms there. So this is what we're looking at at the moment. Just to recap, the monthly benefit of $8000, a waiting period of 30 days and a benefit period two years, you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $317.74. The yeah, let me break it down weekly for you. I'm shocking at this moment. I do apologise. We're already here 3, yeah, yeah. So one about $158 a week there. How's that work for you?
[45 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep, look at 100 and 150, 100 and 5000 and 5000 and 58.
[45 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Sorry.
[45 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : That's fully is it really tax adaptable or just part of it?
[45 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So I look, it would be, we advise at least speaking to a professional in the field. So if you've got a tax person that does it, I wouldn't be able to advise whether it's fully tax deductible or partially. But I believe there is at least an amount you can get back on tax there. But definitely speak to a professional about that.
[46 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : All right, well, send an e-mail to me and I'll, I'll just talk to somebody and and get back to you.
[46 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Well, what else? What I'll do for you, Peter, because we've got some steps I'll need to go through to get that referred and so we can at least have the final outcome because this is just before it gets referred. But was that price, how's that sending for you at the moment there? Was that something that could work for you or do you want to have a look at some different terms to try and change those prices?
[46 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Well, it could. What? What would lower it?
[46 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So the things that are going to lower it is if we change the monthly benefit amount down to 7000, that should drop it. It'll drop the prices by a little bit.
[46 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[46 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Changing the benefit period from 2 years down to one year, that'll also make it cheaper for you.
[46 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Hello.
[46 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And then as well, extending the waiting period there, which is not I guess, ideal in most cases, but going from a 30 day to a 90 day can change it dramatically there too. Four. So it's the 90 days and then that extra 30 days. That's about, yeah, four months time.
[46 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Probably 90 days will be 6 months before you get any money done. Four months?
[47 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Yeah, you can leave it at 30.
[47 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, four months at school, yeah, I'd still leave it at the month you got.
[47 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : That's fine.
[47 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : So that's for 60 days before you get any money and and you know, like it's dependent on working car at the time you and you might be stretching, like maybe you have to stretch a bit to even get out 60 days, you know what I mean?
[47 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, of course. So we can leave that the waiting period of 30 days. That's fine. Do you want to have a look at the benefit period of one year?
[47 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it can do that.
[47 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because that should drop it down. It'll just take me a second because I'll have to reapply that application to it, but that should drop it definitely below the $300.00 mark. I think, look, it's kind of circumstantial, but we should hopefully be looking around. Oh, actually there. So it works out to be $245.89 fortnightly for a benefit period of one year.
[47 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep, better, better 125 a week.
[47 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah. That much better for you there?
[48 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, well, these are these are all you know then both if you like.
[48 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because I was going to, I was, what I was going to do is actually discuss the options that we've got for you there, Peter, in terms of getting this referred as well. So I'll be able to send some information out your way anyway, because we should have a quick turn around with this one. But that way you've at least got something to read through and obviously, you know, run by, you know, whatever you need to do in terms of process this that the other. But if we do find a price that's suitable for you, now we can actually get this application referred off and have the policy placed on a standby, which essentially just means that if they come back with no changes, we can simply just accept it and put your cover in place automatically. But of course, if there are any changes to be made, which the only things I'm thinking that that will happen will be due to obviously the like ACL and shoulder is that they'll probably just pop those exclusions on. And if you're still happy with the cover, I'll just have to give you a buzz and update you obviously let you know what's happened. And then if you're still happy with it, you can accept it, have the cover put in place that way as well. So it just makes it a much quicker process in terms of that bit.
[49 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : No worries.
[49 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So with that paid, I'd look, if you're happy to go that direction, mate, I can get that all sorted for you today. If we pick obviously an amount that seems to be better for you price wise there.
[49 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep, no worries.
[49 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So would you, if you were to help obviously start the policy there, do you think you'd want to work at the two year benefit. Or the one year benefit.
[49 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : I'll probably just go the one year.
[49 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : One year.
[49 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[49 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : And look, if circumstances change, mate, there's no harm in giving us a call at a later stage and you can simply just, you know, apply to have these things reviewed and obviously look at changes that we can make as well down the track there too, right? Beautiful. So what we can do in that sense there? Let me just reapply this application. That way we'll be able to get that sent off to him. Now the other thing is just to mention that are included in this policy. So there's a rehabilitation benefit along with a final expenses benefit. Now the final expenses, mate, that just pays out $10,000 in the event that you would have passed away at no additional cost. Also not at no additional cost, $10,000 in the event you were to pass away. So it's included in the policy there basically a funeral insurance you get just more so I guess you know, bit of courtesy from our end, knock on wood that was happened. You are able to nominate a beneficiary or beneficiaries for it. That just comes out on a form too.
[50 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Alright.
[50 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : The other thing to take into consideration is, of course, how the premiums work now they are stepped, meaning that they will generally increase each year as you age. And I'm just lighting this up here. I'll be able to show you an example of what that looks like. So where are we? So what do I say this year starts off fortnightly $245.89 and that'll be for the 1st 12 months and then after the policy anniversary updates as an indication to $268.96. And that's given that you make no changes to the terms there.
[51 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : What are you?
[51 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK. Now if you do ever get curious, you will be able to find all information about our premium structure on our website. Now if you're happy with the 245, they're paid just to keep you insight on the steps that we go through. I'm more than happy I've got that quote on its way as well. You can have a read through that and obviously wait until the underwriters come back with a final decision. More than happy to do that. But the alternative that I mentioned is having the policy placed on standby. So we go through the steps as if we were setting up the policy. You actually get to pick the first payment date yourself. So it can be anywhere from, I wouldn't say today because we'll wait for them to come back, but anywhere from today essentially up until 30 days away, you actually get to pick the first payment date. So you can line it up with a schedule that's much easier for yourself. And then from that first payment that's made, you do as well get a 30 day cooling off. But that means once the policy is put in place, you'll get your personal information sent out to you via e-mail, takes about an hour, and then via post takes about two to five business days from when you get that e-mail.
[52 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Alright. Yep.
[52 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So were you happy with getting that all placed on standby there, basically having it set up?
[52 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. No, that's Yep.
[52 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. All right, so where are we here? I'll just read this off to you here. So the commencement of your cover will be subject to final assessment by the insurer. If the insurer approves cover without any changes. Are you happy for me to record your acceptance of this policy now? And we'll send out all the policy information to e-mail and postal address. Oh, OK, really. So let's jump into this screen here. As I said, mate, happy to work around whatever suits you best there. Furthest we can push. Just to let you know, you can pick any days in between. Furthest we can pop the first payment would be the 13th of October. In the next couple of days or weeks. Of course, though, what would work best for you?
[52 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm good.
[52 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : That's why it is. No.
[52 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : I just, I went.
[52 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Which day was that? Sorry mate.
[52 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Oh. Well, say probably the 8 of October.
[53 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : 3rd of October on the Thursday, yeah, yeah, I can do that for you mate. That way we'll definitely look what time is it now? About 4-16. We may be lucky in hear back from them just because they do knock off at 5:30 usually around 5530. So I'm hoping they can have a quick look at this one for us today. Hopefully have an outcome. Otherwise worst case it'll be Monday. I'm in at 12:00 on that day and I work up until 8:00 PM as well. So I'll be able to call throughout that time just to advise you of if there are any changes of course to that.
[53 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : If you do have to call me on Monday, make it after 6:30 because I work till 6:30 on my part. Monday next week.
[54 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Easy done. No, no, you're right mate. So what we'll do umm, here? I'll just leave a little note for myself after 630, you said there.
[54 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[54 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yep, beautiful. Just in case it does come down to that for us there. All right, so pick the third of the 10th and then that'll just be from that day starting at the first payment and then every fortnight on the Thursday following the last two steps we just need to go through to get this on standby is not done a preferred method of payment. So that way once it's in place, once the day rolls around, we can make sure the insurance is up to date. You are covered in the meantime, by the way, sorry there, Peter. So from when it gets accepted, even before the first payment, you're still protected. But this is just so we can make sure that furthermore the insurance will be up to date. And then all I need to do is read out a final declaration to you, which just sums everything up in a much more format of it. But we've got two options for you in terms of payment. So either it'll be a direct debit from a BSB and account number, or you can use a card which would be easier for you at the time being.
[55 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Probably. Probably debit, I guess.
[55 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we can do that. If you want to change it at any time in the future, you can. There's not much difference. There's no card surcharge. But I guess look, just with bank details, it may be easier in case cards expire or get stolen, that sort of thing.
[55 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, alright.
[55 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Easy done. Well, we'll pop that down now. Would that be a savings or check account for you, Peter?
[55 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : I understand.
[55 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Savings. And then I'll just confirm. I imagine while you're grabbing those details there, the account name. It was just under Peter. Do I have it right the first time? Sorry, mate. Was it Descent?
