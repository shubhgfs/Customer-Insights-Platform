[4 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So did you have a monthly amount you'd like to be covered for?
[4 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Well, the reason I'm getting a new job is that if I'm going to earn more money, that's part of the policy. And the money I'll be earning will be about 2 1/2 in a week.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : So I don't know if I'm, yeah, it was $2000 a week. That'd be more than enough.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, course, no worries with that one. I can base it off and say it's a monthly benefit amount, so 2000 a week. So if you're looking at around $8000 for the monthly benefit amount, I can start there. If you do need to adjust it up or down, I can quite you want as many amounts as you need to as well.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep Yep.
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but at the moment, umm, could I confirm, are you currently employed or are you self-employed? Yeah, got you.

[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Not currently, no.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : And just to confirm the title annual income pre tax is at least $137,100 or more or not at the moment. Umm in that case because we can actually can insure you at the moment would be up to 70%. Do you know your your current annual income before tax?
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Like as in what I like on a tax with memory would be about 75 grand last year.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 75, there's no, no problems.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Umm, I stopped that because if, if it does change as well down the track, umm, like you mentioned this, that is going up. Umm, if later on, if you do need to increase recovery, you can apply to take out a top up policy. Umm, or if you of course apply to set up a new policy then as well, just be subject to eligibility if you need to. Umm, But at the moment what I can do for you, if it's up to 75,000, I can quote you on the maximum, which will be $4375 for a monthly benefit amount at the moment. Umm, would that be suitable for you?
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, like problems. I'll start there. We do also have options around selecting different waiting periods and benefit periods, just depending on your circumstances. So with your waiting period, it's the non payment period you must like before the income benefits payable after the insured events. So you can choose either 30 days or 90 days, but just keep in mind the income benefits paid in arrears. So admitting if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your US eligible to claim.
[6 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : I think 30 will be better.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So which waiting period would you like me to quote you on either 30 or 90 days 30 no problems and your benefit. So the maximum amount of time we will pay the income benefits anyone injured illness. You can choose from either six months, one year, two years or five years. Thank you.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, let's go. Six months, mate.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, not a problem. So based off those figures, you would be looking at a fortnightly amount of $33.89 in total. Would you be happy to leave it there or would you like to adjust any of those figures?
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No, I think that's fine. Yep.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : No problems, leave it there. Also to mention, we do give you a 10% cash back on that as well. It's the following your first policy anniversary day, 10% of that and that you've paid into it is giving us a cash back to you as well.
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Also included in that policy as standard, we have a rehabilitation benefit. So it's playing a reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit to a maximum of $3000 to assist with rehabilitation costs whilst claiming. And we can also or we can reimburse up to six times a monthly income benefit towards cost of equipment or modifications required to assist to return to work as well. And there's also a built in final expenses benefit. I hope you don't need to use it, but it's playing out $10,000 in the event if you were to pass away. So to assist with funeral or any other final expenses at the time. Yep, the policy as well, just to to keep in mind with your premiums, it is step many. It will generally increase each year's wage. But to give you a, a quick indication of that. So yeah, as an indication, if you make no changes to your policy, the premiums for next year, I'll just give you some projections around that for you as well. So for next year's premiums would be $36.13 a fortnight as an example as well. Yeah. And if you ever need to, you can also find information about that premium structure on our website as well.

[27 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[27 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And while I've got you over the phone today, would you like any other information about the insurance now or would you like me to read any part of the PDS to you?
[27 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : No. The only thing I need is the certificate of currency, but I'm assuming I'll get that in an e-mail.
[27 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right. So once that has come back fully approved, umm, it should be sent out after the first payment date, which umm, that comes back fully approved should be the Monday, umm, I'm hoping Monday morning, which will be all good to go.
[27 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : All in the mail, Yeah, Yep.
