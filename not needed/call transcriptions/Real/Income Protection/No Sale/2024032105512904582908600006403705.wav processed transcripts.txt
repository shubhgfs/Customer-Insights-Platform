[44 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[44 seconds][Agent] : If it does look suitable and something you want to pursue further, that's when he will need to be available to go through the health assessment.

[1 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : All right, sorry, umm, look with the life insurance cover so you know what it's there for, OK? It's providing a financial protection through a lump sum payment if you wish to pass away. OK, Once we pay it out, no strings attached, you can use the money however you need.
[1 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[1 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : All right, umm. Now it is easy to apply for so no medical checks or blood tests, but we do ask a series of health and lifestyle questions over the phone to see if he is approved.
[2 minutes][Customer] : Mm hmm. Yep.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : If he is accepted for cover and once you decide to commence the policy, he will be immediately covered for death due to any cause. The only thing not covered is suicide in the 1st 13 months.
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[2 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[2 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Also included is a terminally ill advanced payment, which means that if he was diagnosed with 12 months or less to live by a medical practitioner, we will pay out the claim in full and in advance.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[2 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Umm. Also included as part of the policy is a $10,000 funeral advance payment that can be requested to help cover those more immediate expenses when he passes away.

He pays a lump sum benefit in the event that he was to suffer the loss of limb or sight, or is unable to work for a period of six consecutive months and is not able to return to work in any field which he's experienced, educated or trained, or if he was to suffer a loss of independent existence. Now, there is an exclusion under this cover for any intentional self-inflicted injury. Please also be aware that any payment made under TPD cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount. OK, sorry. Can I ask, does he work a minimum of 20 hours per week?
[3 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : What is his current occupation? Truck driver? Uh, is that long distance? What's? Sorry, sorry. OK, umm.

[3 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : It hasn't been to Victoria for the last few years, but yeah, OK.
[4 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : All right, Umm, but so we can still look at the life insurance benefit, OK. He is eligible for cover between 100,000 up to $500,000. What amount would you like me to quote you on for that one?
[4 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Say, probably around 3:50 mark, I would say.
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. All right, so $350,000 for the life insurance cover is a fortnightly payment of $79.77.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Umm, sorry, we'll have a look at the income protection for you as well. Sorry, this cover umm, how does the life insurance cover compare so far for you?
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Oh well the one we've got at the moment is they've got it a lot higher. They've got it at 500. But I'm like no, well we don't have a mortgage or anything like as in we don't even own a home, we rent.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : You don't necessarily need that much, right? OK, Yeah, if you can cut it back a bit.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : So with the Harvey, I said it's just with the cost of living at the moment, I said it's just ridiculous.
[5 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. No, that's fair.
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, very much so. Mm, hmm.
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Umm, sorry, with the income protection cover. All right?
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm. Mm hmm.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : It's umm, so it will provide a monthly income benefit paid directly if he's unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and he suffers a loss of income.

[6 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm, yeah. Mm, hmm.
[6 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Keep in mind that there are some exclusions that applied, uh, that apply as outlined in the PDS, OK, Uh, now with income protection, sorry. Keep in mind that some premiums, uh, that premiums as well for income protection are generally tax deductible, which can make it a little bit more cost effective for you in the long run. Umm, any questions so far about this one?
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, that's OK.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, umm, and just confirm again, sorry, umm, Dell has not had to figure out in the last 12 months. That's correct. Yep. Perfect.
[6 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : No last 50.
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : All right and perfect. Hey, especially at the moment, it's great for health and the bank balance, right?
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes, very much so.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Umm, sorry. We'll just go through some questions, umm, in relation to his duties at work to, umm, figure out the benefit amounts we're able to offer.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Mm Hmm.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK. Umm, So does he work in umm, 15 hours or more per week?
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'd say way more, Right? Yes.
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Umm is his role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where he spends majority of time indoors in an office or clinical environment? Uh, does he perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle? Yeah. Is he qualified, skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform his role?
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : 9, Yes, yes.
[7 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Does he work in any of the following fields? Aviation, as a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces? Or does he handle explosives?
[8 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[8 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Does he regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights above 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul at long haul? Yeah, Yeah. So what long haul driving means it's the distance traveled from base is a radius greater than 200 kilometers. OK. So yeah.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Well, yeah, but not Yeah, Yeah, but it wouldn't. It's not often, but yeah.
[8 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Umm, because it is part of it. We do have to put it as a yes. All right. Umm. So that's also with that. Now let me just load up the quote. OK. So we are able to offer a benefit, so a monthly benefit amount of between 1000 up to $5000. What level of protection would you be wanting to look at for that one? Probably the five, the five, Yeah. And can I just confirm, so Dell, is Dell self-employed or employed?
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Probably the five, yes. self-employed.
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Self-employed. Yeah, OK. Umm, sorry. When calculating the pre tax income, it's your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts, less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. OK, this is the map that the business would otherwise stop earning in the event that you were unable to work due to a disability.
[9 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm, mm, hmm.
[9 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : So can I just yeah, so I'll confirm that umm, his total annual income before tax is at least $85,700, is that right?
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Which is everything. Yeah, yes.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Uh, yes, yeah. Cool, alright, umm, now with the income protection. So you do have the option of selecting different waiting periods and benefit amounts depending on your circumstances. Alright so the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose either a 30 day or 90 day waiting period. Keep in mind that the income benefit is paid in arrears. This means if you choose the 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. OK umm. So would you prefer to ha umm, quote you on the 30 day or 90 day waiting 30?
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, probably the three, Yeah, probably the 30 day, yeah.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK, So what we've got there? OK, so if we base, oh, sorry, umm, we'll say with the benefit. As well. So this is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. OK. So you have options available of either six months benefit. One year or two years. What benefit.
[10 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Probably 6 months maybe. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Would you like me to call you on for that six months? Yeah. OK, so based on those figures, umm, for the $5000 of income protection, OK, with the 30 day waiting period, 6 month benefit. You'd be looking at an indicative fortnightly premium of $104.54.
[11 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK mm hmm.
[11 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Alright, umm, Now included with that policy OK, is what's called a rehabilitation benefit, which will pay a reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit to a maximum of $3000 to help with rehabilitation costs whilst claiming. Or we can reimburse you up to six times your income benefit towards the cost of equipment or modifications that are required to assist you in returning to work.
[11 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : MMM.
[11 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Alright. There is also a final expenses benefit included which pays $10,000 in the event that there was to pass away in order to help cover funeral costs or other final expenses as well.
[11 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : A lot of the, a lot of the reason, the main reason we're doing the income protection is because he doesn't have work cover.
[11 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, right. Offer that. Yeah, have, yeah.
[12 minutes][Customer] : And most companies that we contract with want to have income protection because he doesn't have, which is, you know, ridiculous because if we, if he doesn't work, it's on us to pay the bills, not them.
[12 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get, yeah, yeah.
[12 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : But anyway, that's the only reason we're having it and life insurance, well, you know, at the moment I'd cancel that too. But we have just had a friend who literally was 8 weeks and we lost him so and they had and his wife didn't have the cover. So. So when you go through something like that, you just like, yeah, well, we better keep this up.
[12 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : That's umm, oh gosh, yeah, gosh it, it brings it to the front of mind.
[12 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Certainly does.
[12 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Hey, yeah, yeah. So yeah.
[12 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : But at the moment, like it's certainly because I don't know why they're just so expensive. And that's on the 5000, yeah. And that's Fortnite. So that's that. And that's 350, OK, but you and you don't have total permanent discernment because you didn't set your offer. Yep.
[13 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because of his occupation, yeah, we can't offer the total and permanent disability cover. All right, umm, But yeah. So we are able to do the life insurance cover.
[13 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[13 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : OK, which, and look, you know that's like you said, you're conscious of the cost of things at the moment. So I do want to point out with the life cover, OK, you are able to start it off at a lesser benefit amount, OK, As a way to have the cover there, you can always apply to top it up and increase it, OK, Later on if finances, you know, improve a bit, OK, subject to eligibility, of course, but you can, yeah, start off, you know, 250, as you know, gives you that bit of a buffer and that bit of protection there. And yeah, like, you know, once things start to improve, get better, you know, you can apply to increase that cover at any point, Alright.
[13 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so that's definitely another option we can explore for him as well, Yeah.
[14 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK. Well, what I'll do is I'll go through this with him when he gets well.
[14 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, now I've got, I'm assuming this would be Dale's e-mail is bulldogcollege@bigpond.com. Yeah. Did you want me to send it through to that one or do you have do you want me to send it through to yours?
[14 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : I'm hoping he's coming home today when he gets in this afternoon and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, please, yeah, no, please send it through to that.
[14 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[14 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : I got that as well anyway.
[14 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. You both ax? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, send it through to that, yeah.
[14 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[14 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : And then he'll know that we've discussed it and Cos I did actually just try and ring his truck and yeah, his truck answered.
[14 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Fair, fair.
[14 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : So he's obviously not in it at the moment, so I'll give him a call. I haven't seen him since last night, so I'll give him a call later on and just see where he's at and just let him know that.
[15 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Well, he's told me to do this today anyway, so and I'll. And then yeah, probably, hopefully get back to you.

[16 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Oh, nice. Yeah.
[16 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Need to sort this out before we go because the anniversary, this other one falls due, I think, well, we're away, so we need to get it sorted before we leave.
