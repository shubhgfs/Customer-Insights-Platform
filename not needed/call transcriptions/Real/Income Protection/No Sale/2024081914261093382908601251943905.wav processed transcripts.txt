[2 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : OK, so we won't have to double handle it because what I'll be able to do is umm, copy across the, the details from the, you know, the life 1 so you don't have to re go through it all.

[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, So have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?

[4 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Now the TPD, I'm just reconfirming. Do you work a minimum of 20 hours per week? Yes or no? And you're, umm, in administration officer say professional. OK, so TPD as an employed pays as a lump sum benefit in the event that you guys suffer the loss of limbs or sight umm, or are unable to work for a period of six consecutive months and are not able to return to work in any field which you are experienced, educated or trained or if you were to suffer the loss of independent existence. OK? That's how it pays out.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Umm, So what benefit amount? Because you can choose from 50,000 up to your chosen life insurance benefit amount. OK, so how this works? There's an exclusion under this cover. This is just the TPD we're talking about. For any intentional self-inflicted injury. Please be aware that any payment made under total and permanent disability cover reduces the available life insurance benefit amount.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So in saying that, what what sum insured would you like on the TPD? Yep.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Uh, we'll say 500,000 because you can still take the permit disability and the income production at the same time, is that correct? Yep.
[6 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Of course, again, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep. Yep. So it'll be 500,000.
[6 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Cool. And and then with this policy as well, Courtney, I'll just let you know it's designed to be both of them flexible throughout the lifetime of the policy.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.

[6 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep, OK. Yep.
[6 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So you got 600,000 full life cover, 500,000 TPD. OK, so we'll run through some help and lifestyle questions on this one first and we can use the same for income cover, OK?
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep. Oh cool.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Each policy will get you 10% cash back, which is your real reward, OK umm, following your first policy anniversary date with us, we actually give you back 10% of what you've paid within that time just to say thanks for choosing us and being a loyal customer of ours. And the life cover as well, we send out with a free will kit so you can get that updated if needed as well. OK with the TPD because it's completely optional, I just need to ask, are you happy for me to add this optional cover to your quote for the life insurance policy today? Yes or no?
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And also just please be aware that your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. In addition, this policy has automatic indexation, which means each year your sum insured will increase by 5% with associated increases in premium. You can opt out of this automatic indexation each year if you wish. So you do have control over that. OK. Yeah, exactly. You do. So each each year you can. If you don't want that extra cover, you can just let us know. It's just designed for CPI. But umm, yeah, it's up to you.

[28 minutes][Customer] : Yeah.
[28 minutes][Agent] : And you can look at six months, one year, two years or five years. Which benefit. Would you like me to quote you on there, Courtney?
[28 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Uh, it's like at certain periods in a time. Is that what it is?
[28 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Umm, no, it's, it's, it's for, it's for anyone injury or illness. So I'll give you an example. Let's say you've got a one year benefit. OK. And then let's say you're out of action for 14 months. Uh, your Brock leg or whatever, umm, the last two, because the benefit. Is only 12 months. The last two months of that claim, if you like, wouldn't be able to be paid based on the benefit. Chosen.
[28 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, Yep.
[28 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Whereas if you had two years, obviously got 24 months worth of benefit, that's just the maximum. Or the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone enjoy your illness.
[28 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK. Would it go 12 months?
[28 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, 12 months, just a year. Yeah, perfect.
[28 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : So just do a year or.
[28 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : It's up to you. How about I show you the difference between 2:00 and 1:00 or say 12 months and 24 months and you let me know? I think it's not We'll just have a look together. I don't think it's going to be almost double, you know what I mean? It'll just be a few dollars. Every dollar counts there. So I'll show you the two and you let me know. OK.
[29 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : And then the.
[29 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Even six months because I mean, I don't really see us getting sick for longer than six months.
[29 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Well, exactly right, Touchwood, that that's not the case.
[29 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : That's when I would go into the disability section anyway for something like that.
[29 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So the PPD talent, but yeah, that's right. And then the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event.
[29 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : And you can look at 30 or 90 days. Umm, please keep in mind that the income banner is paid in arrears. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim.
[29 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[29 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So which waiting period would you like to call you on? 30 Cool. Alright, so I'll show you all three then.
[29 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : 30 to you. Sorry.
[29 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So if you go 281230 days, two years, the fortnightly premium is $19.41, uh, $19.41. That's fortnightly.
[30 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : It is 41. Yeah.
[30 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So then if you dropped it to one year, it'll bring it down to, uh, $14.95 a fortnight for the one year, and the six months will be $14.22. That didn't change much there. Yeah. And for the sake of of what is it, umm, 73 cents?
[30 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : 925, yeah, and oh, it may as well do the one year for like 73 cents.
[30 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. One year. OK. You want, you want to look at this monthly as well? Is that just easier for you, for everything's monthly?
[30 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, we'll do one year, yeah, yeah, yeah. Monthly.
[30 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. 1495 works out to be 3238 per month. OK.
[30 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : 3238 Yep.
[30 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : You'll get your 10% cash back real reward on this policy as well after the first year. Mental disorder or disease is an exclusion under this policy. So we'll just ask the last couple of income protection questions. But what I've actually done is I've transferred the all the questions on the life insurance across so you don't have to run through all that again.
[31 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's perfect.
[31 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, All right, so, uh, does your work require to go underground, work at heights above 20 meters, dive to depths below 40 meters, easy explosives or travel to areas experiencing war or civil unrest? Or work offshore? Yes or no?
[31 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : No.
[31 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. How many hours do you currently work per week in permanent paid employment? We have at least 20 hours or more. At least 15 hours, but less than 20 hours or less than 15 hours. At least 20 hours or more. Yep. Perfect.
[31 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Minimum yeah, at least 20 hours a month is easy.
[31 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And do you have a second occupation that generates a taxable income? Yes or no?
[31 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : No.
[31 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Have you ever been declared bankrupt or placed in receive a ship in voluntary liquidation or under administration?
[31 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : No.
[31 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Are you a employed or be self-employed? Employed.
[32 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Employed, not self-employed.
[32 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Have you been in your current occupation for at least 12 months?
[32 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Yes.
[32 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Do you intend to change your current occupation in the next 12 months? And do you have existing income protection cover?
[32 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[32 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : And other than what you've already know that's already been done with TPD, that's everything.
[32 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : OK, so that's when you're done.
[32 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Uh, that's yeah, I'm just, umm, excellent. So that, that's straight line that quickly because you have the TPD component on the life insurance. We'd asked all those questions anyway, so that's fine. So let me just see what that. So this one has come back also fully approved. Let me just see what's happened to you. Just is a slight increase just based on height and weight, BMI scale for income protection.
[32 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. Oh, it's going up to date, isn't it?
[32 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So if we leave it at that parameter, 30 days, one years, uh, one year rather or 12 months, it's 45 O 4 per month yeah. So if we do the maths on that, it's showing me here 39.07% what we call lighting. So do you want me to just drop it down to six months and see what that does for you? If it's going to change it drastically?
[33 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I would say what 6 months does.
[33 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, that will work out to be uh, I thought it was going to change a little bit more, but it's 4285 4285 per month, so that's covering 2812 dollars. OK and 30 days six months. OK the other adjustment you could make only with if it's within what you're looking to achieve, you know, you could maybe step down that the income protection benefit amount to like maybe 2 1/2 thousand to 2500 even or something.
[33 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, I still want to do the definitely.
[34 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : You want the 75% Yeah yeah, no, fair enough.
[34 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. I'll do. I'll just stick to a one year cover file. It was 40. Was it 40?
[34 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : I just just we'll go back to that one. That's all right. OK. 4504 exactly per month.
[34 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[34 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : So I'll just bring up this calendar with, uh, just confirming that that's affordable for you. Are you happy with that level of cover?
[34 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, that's one.
[34 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : And that way as a business, we generally collect payment within the next 7 days. We ask when in the next 7 days would be more suitable for you?
[34 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yep.

[42 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[42 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : And umm, the 500,000 TPD is 2385 for 500,000 TPD thing is because you're it's risk rated to, to what you do for work. You know what I mean? So his one's just a little bit more expensive based on that. OK, umm plus even age and and umm gender comes into to play. Obviously, umm, but he's also a non non-smoker, which is good. So I'll let me e-mail that through as well. And umm yeah, is there does he have any sort of any downtime in the shift?
[42 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've had a split section, but I'm not with him. That's the only thing. And so he has no idea what he's doing.
[43 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : No, that's fair enough.
[43 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : So that's the only issue.
[43 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Well, how about, how about if you, if you can give him all those figures, you, everything's saved ready to go. Like I said, you've done all the hard work, right? Umm, So what we'll do is we'll, you have a chat with him and, and let him know that that's what it is. This is the process. We just need to run through the health and lifestyle questions quickly with him and then I can call him on that split shift time. What what works?
[43 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, probably best. I would say about 3:00 maybe. Are you working tomorrow? Yes, I would say around that 3:00 tomorrow.
[43 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 3:00 tomorrow, 3:00.
[44 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Oh, actually he types his number so I think when is the best time because he's not with me and he'll wanted to be on my mobile. Umm, umm, hello.
[44 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, still here.
[44 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Oh, sorry. Umm, if you e-mail me, can I e-mail you back once I speak to him? Because he's at work right now, so it's really hard for me to sort of speak to him.
[44 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, there's no, I mean, you can reply to the e-mail. I think it prompts me to give you a call if you say, if it says ready to go ahead if it's got that function on the one I sent through for you. But your actual policies are in force and active now you're covered on both of those.
[44 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. If you want to e-mail me, he's separate or something, I don't know.
[44 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So it may not give you that option, whereas what I can do, just thinking, do do you want me to follow up later?
[45 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Follow up, Rick. Yeah, follow up Rick one, umm, if you can, like make. I don't know. I'm thinking what am I with him? You know, open all weekends.

[45 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, of course I can. Yeah, I can give you a courtesy call on the 26th.
[45 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : So unless he's, if you follow me up on the 26th, umm, I mean mom will be in place already, but he's can then go in after that.
[45 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course I can. That's fine.
[45 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : But the only thing is, is that it would be separate transaction dates when that for the policies to come out.
[45 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Uh, yes, it would. But what I could do possibly let me just have a look at it and allow me to do that 26 Yeah, just. It'll just be shy of the umm wha? What about would you? Will you be speaking with him before, before he finishes tonight?
[46 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No, because he doesn't. He's already had his brake. He's already had his split brake.
[46 minutes][Agent] : Like maybe in umm, Yeah, OK. Umm ho. How about just more of a courtesy than anything. I'll touch base with you tomorrow sometime That works for you while I don't get you at work or anything.
[46 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[46 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : And then just see see where where we've gone. You know, if, if umm understand, you know, you, you probably won't be that keen to pass on his number, but it would just be safe and secure in, in his profile. And we'd really only have to call it that one time to go through the questions. I'm not suggesting you have to hand it out now. You just just have a, have a chat with him and just just make him aware. And, but I think if it comes from, you know, from you yourself, it'll be more comfortable with it, that idea, you know what I mean?
[46 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah, OK.
[46 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and then that way, you know, you just say, look, I've done all the hard work. All you need to do is go through these questions and, and listen to these declarations. It'll take 15 minutes, you know what I mean? Not even, because like I said, you've done all the actual hard work on it. Umm, And then same thing I just sent you in the BSP account number the day he wants it to come out, if he wants it to come out with yours or you want his to come out with yours, whatever is, just let him know the date and everything, and then we'll go through there. How's that sound?
[47 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. I'm just doing my math right now.
[47 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, you're right.
[47 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Sorry just for his color because of course he's older and everything is more expensive.
[47 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. See the more expensive part of his policy is you can do compared to yours, as you can see rather compared to yours is that TPD just the risk rating of it. But you can you can play around with the figures anyway.
[47 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[48 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : That one, no, that one won't come up because of the profile and how it's set up. We have to go through those questions. What's what's his monthly pay tax income?
[48 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : And then do you know roughly what his income protection would be a month, uh, pre tax would be 4166?
[48 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 4166. So we can then offer a cover, $3124.00 worth of cover for his one.
[48 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, Yep.
[48 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but yeah it'll be on we're just sitting in the link. Umm, I did yes and OK like I'll show him all the different options with the six months, one year, 2 years as well, but I guess you just want it set up the same as yours, do you? Almost identical.
[48 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, These are standards, right?
[48 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. Alright.
[48 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Because I just need to know that if it's because if this isn't under what I've been quoted elsewhere, then OB obviously I'm going a bit cheaper.
[48 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : So in terms of umm, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Definitely. I totally understand.
[49 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Umm, so that's why I need to know what his would be. So then I can sort that out.
[49 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. So I've you've got all the figures for the life and TPD, is that right? Yeah, And he's, umm, he said all fit and healthy. Just asthma maybe, you said.
[49 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I can see that. I think.
[49 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, but he's a nonsmoker as well. Yeah. OK.
[49 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So why? Why would they let you bet on something that you already had to do? Just gonna get out of your profile. What's the best time I can call you tomorrow just to touch base?
[50 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Umm, you can call me at 3:00. That's fine.
[50 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : You wouldn't believe it, right?
[50 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah. Three. That's fine.
[50 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK, his date of birth. Sorry. Yeah, 89. That's right. All right, sorry. What's your, because your work numbers come up on this one again, somehow I'm not sure what's your mobile contact? Yep. Just hold on 0447. Yep.
[50 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : The ninth of the 1st 1989 044741 Oh yeah, SO 0447416099.
[51 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Excellent chef and of course he works more than 20 hours per week. Of course much more. He does that almost in 2 days.
[51 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yes, about that.
[51 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[51 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yeah, we'll do one year, $30.
[51 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : So 4166 is that's pre tax cool and are we looking at one year cool $30.84 fortnight, so 3124 thirty days one year, so same same parameters as your one.
[52 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So it's 666682 a month, is that correct?
[52 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : I think you've done the maths right. Yes, Yep.
[52 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, let's do all my calculations of everything.
[52 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no, that's, that's spot on. Plus you get you get 10% cash back on both of his policies as well. And we're we're giving you a call back tomorrow at around 3:00. And then, yeah, just just so you know the figures, even when he's ready to run through the questions, I can, I can make sure I'll do the same as I did with your one. Just try to streamline it so we don't have to double handle all the the questions on both policies. I'll just G copy them across to that one. OK, perfect.
[52 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. No worries.
[52 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Well, I'll follow up tomorrow at 3 for you just to touch base to see how you're going and and we'll go from there.
[52 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Thank you very much.
[52 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Alright, you're most welcome and have a have a lovely evening. Thank you.
[52 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : You too.
[52 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Cheers.
