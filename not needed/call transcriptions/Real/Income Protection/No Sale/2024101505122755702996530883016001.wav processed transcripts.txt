[2 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Umm, MMM. I mean, it does depend on the nature of your work.

Best assessment.
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep, of course.
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Umm, uh, firstly, so that'd be the questions asked, just relating to what you do at work to some more of options we can offer, umm, as we go along as well. Excuse me, umm, I'll give you an insight into how the policy works in different aspects.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : If you have questions in any stage, you're welcome to ask.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : No worries.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, I can certainly help out. Umm, and then ultimately, uh, once we've done the dues based assessment, we'll go through some different costs and options.
[5 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, uh, we'll adjust that up or down as we go. And I wanna make sure that we find the appropriate amount of cover, umm, that will, umm, help your needs, uh, and keep it all affordable for you at the same time.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : OK, Otherwise, umm, OK, so from there, if we're able to find that appropriate color for you, so then apply. I'm gonna T off and lifestyle questions over the phone, see if you're approved and if so, in what sense we can offer cover.
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yeah, of course. Yep.
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, If you are accepted and once you decide to commence the policy, how it then works, Umm, and you're coming immediately And so your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday and uh, keep in mind as well there are some exclusions that applies outline the PDS.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, Another thing to keep in the back in mind as well with regards to costly income, income protection, the premiums, uh, they are generally tax deductible.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK, sorry.
[6 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : OK, So hopefully can help making more cost effective for you. Alright. Otherwise, and that is simply how it works the very most part, umm, other aspects of the cover. I'm gonna explain, umm, once we, uh, get to the quotation stage, but we'll do the G's based assessment first. Are there any questions you have before we do look at the, umm, go through the G's based assessment here.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Alright, in that case, first of all, uh, Jason, I'll let you know before answering any of our questions, it's important you're aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly as value to do so could impact your current client side. And these are yes or no answer questions.
[7 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Uh, first of all, do you work 15 hours or more per week? Yes or no?
[7 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Sorry. What was that?
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Do you work 15 hours or more per week? Is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature? We spend the majority of your time indoors in office or clinical environments, so we're not one of the companies that require uh. Do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery, or drive a vehicle? Are you qualified, skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role?
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[7 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Do you work any of the following fields, Aviation as a part or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces or do you handle explosives? And do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights of 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul?
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK, one more question, just more so relating to health and work. Jason, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Sorry.
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Very good. Alright, now I do always need to confirm here if you're currently employed or self-employed. You mentioned your work up in ABN, so you're self-employed.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I am self-employed.
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, if you case, when I refer to pre tax income in your circumstances case I'm referring to your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts. So less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. So Jason, this is the amount the business would otherwise cease earning in the event you are unable to work due to a disability. OK, now, uh, we can look anywhere between $1000 up to $15,000. I can confirm based on your duties, umm, there have been no change to any of the parameters. Umm, but it's up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income. And so I can calculate the maximum we can offer based off your annual pre tax income if you have that available, Yep.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, Yep, off the top my head about monthly of what I earn. Is that what you're asked to say?
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Your annual pre tax income if possible.
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Oh, annual, so yearly.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[9 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : I'll have to calculate it.
[9 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Very easy.
[9 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, so monthly.
[9 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : And if you have the monthly, I can kind of work off that a month. OK.
[9 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : So weekly on to about about 8 grand a month, or maybe maybe 8 1/2 and maybe 9 at the most. Just depends on if I do 5 or 6 days a week.
[9 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : In that case, what's that? Yeah, sure. So 70%, that would be 5950, uh, and so would I be able to confirm then, uh, that your total annual income before tax is at least $102,900?
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that, that sounds about right.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. OK, easy. In that case, umm, yeah. We can offer the monthly, uh, benefit anywhere between $1000 up to umm, $6000 if we're working off $102,900 your annual pre tax income.
[10 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Oh.
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, between those parameters between $1000 up to 6000 a month, what would be necessary for you would be the maximum or would a lower amounts fast in the event of a claim?
[10 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : How much I would need if if I had to take time off? I don't know.
[10 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, if you could.
[10 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : 646700 probably the maximum to be honest is on if I think I'm in it one second. I think it's four more bills, probably 15.
[10 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : There it is.
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : It's four bills each week, 15 times one. Yeah, No, definitely. It'd probably be the next time.
[11 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we'll work off 6000 as a monthly benefit then no problem.
[11 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.
[11 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : And Jason, there are two other factors that go into income protection insurance as well.
[11 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK, uh, first of which is the waiting period and the other is the benefit period. Now these both, uh, in, uh, apply to, uh, when you make a claim on the policy.
[11 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : OK, so the waiting period is the non payment period. You must wait before the income benefit is payable after your short of it. Umm, the options available are 30 days or 90 days.
[11 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : And uh, keep in mind Jason, the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears.
[11 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[11 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : OK, so to choose a new waiting period, the first payment would be 60 days after you first eligible the claim.
[11 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[11 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : And it is up to you between these two what's gonna be necessary.
[12 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[12 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Umm, if you require the income benefits sooner rather than later, then perhaps the 30 days more ideal, but that is gonna be more expensive between the two options since it is the shorter. Whereas if you have say savings, uh, or some umm, if your umm, partner's income can help justify a longer 90 day waiting period, then that is, uh, cheaper between the two options.
[12 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[12 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK, but, uh, in your circumstances, Jason, would you rather we looked at 30 days or 90 days first?
[12 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : How much?
[12 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, great question. And umm, I can't really give you the exact number because there are multiple factors going to it.
[12 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : How much is the difference between the 30 and 90 days round roundabout?
[12 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So maybe let's, yeah, it, it's around about a 40% difference, roughly speaking. Umm, so maybe, perhaps we look at 30 days first and if we need to, uh, adjust downward in price, that'll be the first place you will.
[12 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, no worries.
[12 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : OK, easy. Otherwise, Jason, the, uh, the benefit. This one's simple how it works. It's the maximum amount of time that we pay the income benefit anyone injury of illness. OK, so the maximum amount of time that we'll pay a claim per claim, the options here are six months, one year, two years or five years.
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[13 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, so effectively this will determine what our worst case scenario would be.
[13 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[13 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and the shorter, the cheaper, the longer, the more expensive. As you can imagine in this circumstance, umm, what benefit. Would you preferably look at first mate?
[13 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 7-6 months. Is that cheaper? 1, isn't it?
[13 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, should. Six months would be the very cheapest.
[13 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, the 12th. Yeah, yeah.
[13 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 12 months, one year easy, Jason, working off of $6000, the monthly benefit, 30 days, the waiting period and one year is the benefit. What that comes in to be is a total fortnightly premium of $56.53. OK.
[13 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, a fortnight.
[14 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right.
[14 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : That's alright.
[14 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : And yeah, is that going to be comfortable for you so far? Are there any adjustments you prefer we make?
[14 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I'm I'm pretty happy with that fortnight.
[14 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK, anything else in that case? Yeah, as a reminder, that's $6000 the monthly benefit, 30 days, the wedding. In one year as the benefit. $56.53 fortnight.
[14 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[14 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So from here, Jason, what I'm going to arrange is I'll load up the health and lifestyle questions to determine your eligibility for this income protection cover as well as the terms which we can offer cover too.
[14 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[14 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Bear in mind, depending on your medical history and things of that nature, umm, as well as your, uh, the lifestyle as well, personal circumstances, umm, there could be changes made in the application, umm, from your answers, be it so the terms of the policy, umm, additional exclusions, umm, or potentially, uh, the cost, the insurance, OK.
[14 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[14 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : If any changes occur, we can of course, umm, address any of them afterwards.
[15 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. No worries.
[15 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Uh, otherwise, while that loads, excuse me, umm, I'll give you a further insight and the couple benefits we include as well as how the cost the insurance works over time. And then Jason does also confirm your details. Just make sure everything we have here is up to date. Obviously, we have the information from your life insurance, umm, policy.
[15 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[15 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Anyways, umm, first of all though, Jason, with the policy, we'll provide to you a rehabilitation benefit as well as a final expenses benefit. Now, final expenses benefit for reference, this pays $10,000 to your family in the event that you pass away.
[15 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[15 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Uh, so the help with funeral costs and other immediate expenses like that, OK, so make sure the wife is on top of that as well.
[15 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I will.
[15 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Umm, otherwise with the policy as well, uh, the cost, the insurance, the premium, it is steps. OK Jason, that means we'll generally increase each year as you age.
[15 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[15 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Umm, As an indication though, if you made no change to the policy, umm, so just keeping all the same parameters next year as what you currently have, the premium next year would be $56.15 a fortnight.
[16 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[16 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : You can also find information about our pre instructional website. OK?
