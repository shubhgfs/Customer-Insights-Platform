[2 seconds][Customer] : Well, I try to speaking.
[3 seconds][Agent] : Hi Peter, my name is Joel. I'm calling from Real Insurance. How you going?
[7 seconds][Customer] : Not too bad though.
[8 seconds][Agent] : That's it. Well, thanks for asking. Reasonably cool. I was following up on your online enquiry to get some quotes for income protection cover. Yeah, just going to bring up the quotes for you and of course, I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have as well.
[16 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[23 seconds][Agent] : Now just to let you know that all our calls are recorded. Any advice provided is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. And just for compliance, can you please confirm your name and date of birth?
[34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I paid. I'd recommend it. And it's 12th, 4th, 91.
[36 seconds][Agent] : That's the one. And you are of course, a male issue in residence.
[41 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[40 seconds][Agent] : Great, thanks very much. And if you don't mind me asking, what's made you look at getting quotes for income protection cover today?
[51 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I had plenty of money into the bank, so if something ever happens to me, I suppose I made something to fall back on.
[56 seconds][Agent] : OK, I get you.
[1 minutes][Customer] : Yeah.
[57 seconds][Agent] : So it's more just kind of that just in case sort of what if scenario.
[1 minutes][Customer] : Just in case. Yeah.
[1 minutes][Agent] : That's really sure.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine. Look, I won't take much of your time. I'll quickly bring up some quotes. Just while I do that, I'll give you a quick rundown on how the policy looks and what it covers. It's umm, yeah. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. But uh, basically with the income protection, that's very straightforward. So it is designed to provide a monthly income benefit that gets paid directly to yourself if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and if you do suffer a loss of income. So essentially it is designed to help cover your bills and living costs if you sell, Excuse me, if your salary is interrupted.
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm, yeah.
[1 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, you can apply if you work at least 15 hours per week in paid employment and do offer an income benefit up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income. So it does range from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000 a month. Now, the application process is pretty simple, basically just some health and lifestyle questions over the phone to see if you are approved and if so, on what terms we can offer cover. And once it is in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Uh, please keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the product disclosure statement and also premiums for the income protection and generally tax deductible as well, just to make it a bit more cost effective come tax time.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm, yeah.
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Now to generate a quote, I just have to ask you some questions regarding your duties at work, but they're just yes or no questions. It just says here, uh, before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your coverage claims time. First one says uh, do you work 15 hours or more per week? Yes. Uh, is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature? Will you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment? Yep. Are you requi Sorry. Do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle? And are you qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role? Yep. And do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces, or do you handle explosives? Yep.
[2 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, No, uh, no Cold Ford, no.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : And do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights above 10 meters, work offshore or carry a firearm? Perfect. And can I please confirm, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? And are you currently employed or self-employed?
[3 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : No, no self-employed.
[3 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Sure. So the definition of pre tax income for self-employed is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. So this is the amount that the business would otherwise cease earning in the event that you were unable to work due to a disability. Just for the sake of the quote. You know what your annual income before tax would be easy based on 201,000. All right, so based on your duties and your income, that means I can quote you on a monthly insured amount anywhere from $1000 a month up to a maximum of $11,725.00 a month. What amount would you like me to quote you on?
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it was 201 thousand last return 11,000.
[4 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Sure. So we'll get the 11K all right. Now there's a couple of components to the income protection that do affect the price. So there is a waiting period and a benefit. So just to clarify, the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after being short of it.
[4 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Mm Hmm.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So you can choose from either 30 days or 90 days.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Now please keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So this means that if you chose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. Umm, which waiting period would you like me to start the quote on? 30 / 90 days?
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, the city does, Yeah.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure, no worries. And the benefit. So this is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So essentially you can choose the length of time you'd like to be covered each time you're unable to work. There are four options. You can choose either six months, one year, two years or five years. Uh, which benefit. Would you like me to start the quote on?
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Start with one year and we're working here from there, I guess.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. We can always adjust it. That's fine. Now, I'll give you an indicative figure. Keep in mind these prices can change when we go through the health and lifestyle questions. To give you an indication, let's say if you're looking at a cover of $11,000 a month with a waiting period of 30 days and a benefit period of one year, works out to be a fortnightly premium of $77.02. So it's, yeah, roughly about just touch under 40 odd dollars a week.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes][Agent] : And yeah, that would pay $11,000 a month directly to you every month up to a maximum of 12 months. And that's for each individual into your illness. But, uh, I realize obviously no one knows your situation better than yourself. Umm, does that cover sound like the sort of thing you were looking for or you were to adjust those figures?
[6 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yeah. What about what about two years? What's that?
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Sure. You went two years, that would make it $98.58 a fortnight, so about $50 a week basically.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Sort of, Yeah, go with that one. Yeah.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, no worries. This situation, what we do like to do for all our customers just while we have you on the phone is just quickly go through those health and lifestyle questions just so that we can let you know if you are eligible. And that way if you are approved and if you're happy to, I can organize to send you out all the documentation so that you can take some time to read through it in your own time. Uh, just make sure that you're happy with it. You're right to go through those questions now.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yeah. Is is this one of those things you can cancel at any time?
[7 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's exactly right. It's basically just a pay as you go type policy. So you're not locked in for anyone term or anything like that. Uh, no cancellation fees. You can cancel at any time as long as you're not in the process of claiming on the policy. That makes sense. Sure.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : So in six months time and I want it or I can bring up and cancel or Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : OK, I'll just quickly run you through those couple of other details to let you know. Umm, with the policy itself, it also includes a rehabilitation benefit along with the final expenses benefit, which pays $10,000 in the event that you were to pass away. The other parts keep in mind is that the premium is, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. I've got a projection here, so I'll just show you what that looks like. Just as you as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy next year, the fortnightly premium would be 1 dollars and $0.97. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website as well. Yeah, just before I do jump into the questions, I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing by you. Is that all making sense for you so far? Yeah, easy. All right, I'll just quickly update your profile and I'll get straight into it. Can I please get your post code? Thanks very much. And what's the town or suburb there? No worries. And what's your address there, please? Yep.
