[28 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : You can give me the answer based on one to two episodes, 3 to 4 episodes, five to six episodes, 7 plus episodes, Yes, correct. And if you need the definition on the episode, like what do you mean by the episode? I can read that out for you as well.
[28 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, yeah 'cause I wasn't hospitalised, I was just on medication for a couple of years.
[28 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Do you want me to read that just on medication? OK, what I'm gonna do doing I'm gonna read you the definition just to give you some clear idea and you can select how many episode that you have to go through that.
[28 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, Yep, Yep.
[28 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, Let me just bring out the medical definition. Just give me one second.
[29 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : It's hard to say episodes because it was continual for two years, so it's hard to sort of say how many episodes, you know what I mean?
[29 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yeah, yeah, it's exactly right. So after reading the de umm umm definition you will have some clear idea.
[29 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : It's like, yeah, yeah.
[29 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK so when I said episode it means Jonah. An episode is an event, occurrence or recurrence of symptoms which increased severity from normal mood and usually require either medical intervention, referral, treatment or alterations. Slash adjustment to existing maintenance treatment.
[29 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[29 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : OK, the treatment can take the form of medication and slash or counseling, slash therapy. I'll give you the example. There are three points to be noted.
[29 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[29 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : First example is if someone has mental health symptoms that required treatment, this is an episode and if they return to their doctor several times to monitor the situation and slash or for repeat prescription, this is the same single episode. So this would be 1 episode only. OK. If however they have a relapse and the symptoms worsen or symptoms worsen and treatment is to be changed or increased, then this constitute a second episode. Umm. Similarly, if the applicant recovers and the treatment is stops and the applicant is fine, but at a later date the symptoms return and they have to go back to the doctor to seek further advice. This would be a separate episode, OK? This would because if another another different episode. OK.
[30 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[30 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : So based on that, Donna, how many episodes have you had which require treatment 122324526 or seven past episodes?
[30 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : It's hard to do, isn't it?
[30 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So when you, when you went to the doctor for the first time, how many times did you go back or did you go back for the repeat prescription or increased prescription?
[31 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, I did for that year, but I was also doing like 10 sessions with a counselor or or a psychiatrist at the same time. So I'm just trying to work out because that went on through the year. That's the thing.
[31 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK, No, uh, a as I can, as I told you before the treatment, it can take the form of medication and slash or counseling slash therapy as well.
[31 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I suppose one, I suppose if that's the one that's ongoing. So it was over two years.
[31 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : And did you did you have to increase the medication or is it is that the same medication? OK, OK. So, yeah, as you mean the counseling?
[31 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : No no no and I ended up weaning myself often because I actually felt sicker on the Master after the two years, but I had to keep up the psych for about 6 months and I haven't been back since. So what would that be? 1 episode maybe?
[32 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, so it's entirely up to you. Do you want me to re repeat the definition again? Give you the example again just to give you an A clear idea.
[32 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : It's not really clear, is it? Just just do the one.
[32 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : OK OK so for example, don't know if someone has mental health symptoms that require treatment. OK, this is an episode and if they return to their doctor several times to monitor the situation and slash or for repeat prescription, this is the same single episode. If however they have a relapsed or symptoms worsen the treatment needs to be changed or increased then this constitute a second episode. I can.
[32 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK, OK. No, it's only one thing.
[32 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK. And there's a last example, Donna. Similarly, if the applicant recovers and the treatment is stops and the applicant is fine, but at a later date the symptoms have come back or you can say the symptoms have returned and they have to go back to the doctor to seek further advice. This would be a separate episode. OK, So based on the definition, Donna, how many episodes have you had which require treatment, 122324526 or seven plus episodes? OK, I don't have the exactly 1 episode to be selected for you. I have the one to two episode. I'm gonna select that for you now.
[33 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : 1 Yeah, yeah.
[33 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : And our next question is asking about was it more than one episode, yes or no? OK, thank you. Have you have you had symptoms or treatment for this condition within the last six months? Yes or no? Thank you. Have you ever seriously contemplated or attempted suicide? Yes or no?
[33 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : God, I'd say no, no, no.

[34 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Like the factors that was causing you the PTSD or a or depression? Asking about half the factors removed or partially removed. So it's not regarding the symptoms.
[34 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, they've been removed cause yeah 'cause I've moved town and different jobs. So yes, they have been removed.
[34 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So I'll repeat the question again. So half the factors or causes that trigger the symptoms being partially or fully removed, yes or no? Thank you. In the last 10 years, have you required hospitalization as a result of this condition, yes or no?
[34 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Fully removed Yes No.
[34 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : In the in the last five years, how many? My apologies. I repeat the question. In the last five years, how much time off work have you required as a result of this condition? It can say zero to two weeks, two to four weeks or more than four weeks.
[35 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's going to make it difficult anyway because I wasn't employed then. I was self-employed.
[35 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK. And did you have to take any time off work?
[35 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : I did, but I, I, as I said, I wasn't getting a paid employment. It was all self-employed because we were working a business together.
[35 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[35 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : This is relating to the mental health, isn't it?
[35 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : And how many weeks did you have to take the time off Co correct. And we are going to in the last five years time frame two.
[35 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Oh, God, I could only take two weeks off because I had to get paid employment.
[35 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So we are asking about the last question again. So in the last five years, how much time off work have you required as a result of this condition? So zero to two weeks would be more suitable for you then.
[35 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[35 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK. And And so we captured the depression on the dissection and the PTSD. So we can move on to the next question now.

So have you ever doing your working carrier required more than two consecutive weeks off work due to illness or injury, yes or no? Thank you so much. So next two questions. That is in regards to your family history. OK, so when I'll be saying your immediate family, I'll be referring back to your mom, dad, brother and sister only.

[43 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Before age 60, No. OK, that's OK. We're gonna capture that as a no then. Alright, so next question. Alright, alright. Other than one of events, gift certificate slash vouchers, do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fair paying passenger on a recognized airline, Motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, axe ceiling, scuba diving deeper than 40 meters, cave or egg diving or any other hazardous activity, Yes or no? Wonderful. Thank you so much for answering all the questions to now. So coming back to the rehashing back all the question, making sure that we capture everything accurately as possible. So Jonah, you mentioned to me earlier about the autoimmune disease. Which one do you do you refer back to? Did you refer back to the Crohn's disease? Is that what you're trying to say? OK, all right, that's beautiful. I did capture the Crohn's disease. That's perfect.
[44 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I've had that for a number of years. So I just didn't know whether there was a cut off with that or whether you're currently diagnosed or what.
[44 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : No, I no, that's OK. We did capture the Crohn's disease and you have an exclusion for that as well. I'd read that out to you as well. Mm hmm.
[44 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, because I'm more stable now because I know with some insurance policy, if you've been diagnosed with it fairly recently, then they don't like to take out policies because they know that there's a lot of medical and surgeries and and things that you have to have time off work.
[45 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah.
[45 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : But I've had it for over 20 something years and it's managed now anyway.
[45 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Oh, that's good. I'm glad to hear that we did capture the current assistance. Not a problem. So then, then what I'm going to do quickly for you, I'm going to place you on a brief hold, just making sure everything has been captured as quickly as possible.
[45 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Please hold the line for me. I'll be only a second. I'll be right back. Thanks.
[45 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Sure.
[46 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : And she also makes sure she also had a kidney stone removed about eight years ago. OK. And so I captured the eight years ago kidney. So do you have to capture the future one or? Yeah. So she's ongoing at the moment, right. So where is kidney? We say no. Should I refer or for the sister one or Yeah, just find out. Just ask her if it's like still ongoing and she's still getting tests and like reviewed and stuff like that, you probably would need a referral or maybe even place her on hold. She said that she had done a bowel surgery and the doctor had done a heart kidney or something that she did a lot of the kidney. OK. She also has Crohn's disease. The checking capture. Yeah. And then she had bowel removed. Yeah. That it also captures. She's like, she's getting the kidney. Was it into cren disease that she had? Yeah, yeah, Yeah. So she's like, like father and wife, they might get a surgery done. So I only catch the previous one. Do I have fall under the same section? No, I won't fall under the same section. But what I'm you always want to capture the most risk, right. The most risk is going to be that she currently has. Thank you. So you, I'd probably refer this because it's still like kind of ongoing and she may require surgery. And if, if I refer you, it's gonna be fine because she's gonna see the doctor. Yeah. So maybe, maybe ask her when, when the application things. Because if you, well, you could capture it here as a kidney stone and then you tell it no, it's not past Umm, And then that she's had two attacks now and that lets you proceed. But it's just if you saw this policy, it'll be marked. I don't know if it'd be. It does not be. I think the safest way it would be to refer that way you don't have any QA issues or reach out to reader and ask her. I was going to be like, look, she had eight years ago, one passed, but she has one currently. So I understand. We obviously talk about the most risk. Can I capture it? Just as no, the kidney stones are not passed and no two attacks. Is that suitable or see what she says? Like I said, it's like if it's so early in the month, yeah, just double confirm with Rita and then she's not quite sure. Just just refer it to be like be more safe and sorry, right, You don't want to get have any issues. Just this message and hey, can I are you free? But they might just be it now. She was read the other day and she called me straight away. So she said, Can you message me? None. Yes, Sir. Good, Michael.
[51 minutes][Customer] : You doing?
[51 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Thank you, Dana, for holding the line for me. I appreciate your patience there.
[52 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : That's all right.
[52 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : And the, and the reason why it took me a while because I was going back forth with the medical condition. So with the kidney stones that you're going to see a doctor as well.
[52 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm. Yep.
[52 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : So I'm, I was, I'm going to take you back to that question again, just to call like note down as accurate information as possible.
[52 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[52 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So, so we did capture the kidney disease or disorder as a yes. OK.
[52 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Hmm. Mm.
[52 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : And so one kidney stone have passed and you're also going to have another one get treated soon as well, correct.
[52 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : For this episode, no.
[52 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : One in each kidney.
[52 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : I've got 2-1 in each kidney and they're still there.
[52 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, It's still there. OK, So what's so coming back to the next last question. So was your kidney condition limited to kidney stones and have these been passed or treated? So you got three options. Yes, kidneys don't have passed slash treated. No, kidney stones not passed, slash treated other kidney conditions. So do you think no would be more applicable because your kidneys don't have not passed or treated yet?
[53 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yes. No, they're going to be, but they're not yet.
[53 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, not yet. Yes, exactly. Right.
[53 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[53 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So you're gonna kept it as a no, No, kidneys not passed, slash treated.
[53 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[53 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : And next question, how many attacks have you had?
[53 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : It will be my second.
[53 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : You can say 123 plus second. OK, perfect. So captured as a second one. So we, we captured everything as accurately as possible. Perfect. Thank you so much.

[54 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[54 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Is to you due to Crohn's disease. And based on the umm, questions that you have asked me, umm, that you've answered about the Crohn's disease, they're the exclusions that added. So the exclusions for the Crohn's disease is no benefit of the payable for any disability condition, disease condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to or arising from Crohn's disease.

[55 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : That's not too bad Cos I get paid every two weeks. That's not too bad.
[55 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Would that be manageable and suitable for yourself?
[55 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Cos actually it's the same price as my private health fund, so that's good.
[55 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : I'm glad to hear that and I'll let you know as well in, in terms of how the premium will calculate for you in the future. So your premium misstep, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. And as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be, I'll let you know quickly as well. So you have some idea $100.26 per foot now and your monthly benefit amount it will be 1283 dollars, OK?
[56 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK, well.
[56 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : And you can also find information about our premium instructor on our website too. And with real insurance donor, you're also going to get a real, a real reward adds to the policy. What that means is following your first policy anniversary date donor, you're going to receive 10% of the premium you have paid in that time. So you're going to refund your 10% of the premium following your first policy anniversary, OK?
[56 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : OK, right.
[56 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : So you're going to receive $240.82 back after the first year, OK.
[56 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Good.
[56 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : And included in the policy there are some extra benefits. So you have some idea about that.
[56 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : There is a rehabilitation benefit along with the final expenses benefit. The final expenses benefit, it pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away, that will assist your beneficiary to go to the immediate funeral cost. Any other final expenses?
[56 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah.
[56 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, so just to clarify that, Donna, while you're holding the policy, if anything happens to you, say if you passed away, the $10,000 will be paid at your beneficiary.
[57 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : And what if you don't have a next to King though, or anybody to pass that beneficiary on? Where does that go?
[57 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So they can use that money to go through, Yep, if you don't put down a beneficiary, as I as far as I know, it will go through that state as well.
[57 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : So you'll still be able to, somebody will be able to bury you with it, I would think.
[57 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : And yeah, so it's better if you have a like a friends or family or someone that you can trust. It could be from your workplace, it could be from your neighborhood, anyone you could trust and you can put not down as a beneficiary.
[57 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : I've got a cousin in Victoria in Tasmania, so maybe I'll put her down for that.
[57 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So as as yeah, beautiful. So when you pass away, she will receive the $10,000 to go through your immediate funeral expenses as well. OK, lovely. So, Donna, what I can do for you today? I can get you the income protection cover immediately over the phone and send you the tailored policy copy so you can review everything in writing. OK. Umm, I'll send you. Yeah.
[57 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, right now what happens if with these kidney bones? Because I've got one in each this time which I haven't had before.
[58 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm.
[58 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : I've only ever had a small one in just one kidney.
[58 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[58 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : If they decide the specialist decides to do surgery like in the next two week, and if I have to have like, you know, a stent put in or something more, I'm not saying I have to, but this is what he's saying. If he's going to do the two in one procedure and I have to not work for two weeks, I'm not covered then, am I?
[58 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : I did capture the kidney stone scent of dissection. OK. Mm, hmm.
[58 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Because when he did tell me that depending on the CT scan that I had done yesterday, if he decides to do the two, then he won't know till he actually gets me in there if he's going to do theatre or not. But he's just letting me know that if he decides to go ahead with the day case and it's worse than what he thought it was, I might have to have the two weeks off. But I don't know until I actually what he decides until next week, that's all.
[59 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[59 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : So if I have to have two weeks off, say it's the worst case and he does have to, you know, I have to stay like 3 days in hospital or something and then have another two weeks off. Am I covered or not?
[59 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, good questions there, General. As I said, the pro policy is designed to provide the monthly income benefit if you're unable to work due to it.
[59 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, but it's a 30 day waiting period though, isn't it? But I know. Yeah.
[59 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Is it correct if it is if you're unable to work due to disabling sickness or injury and if if you suffer a loss of income as well and in your case there's a 30 days waiting period as well that you have selected so your fast payment, it would be 60 days after you are fast eligible to claim.
[59 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I know.
[59 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, so if you put down a successful claim, you're not gonna pay straight away.
[1 hours 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 hours][Agent] : You have to set up the waiting period as well.
[1 hours 3 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah.
[1 hours 3 seconds][Agent] : And the first payment would be 60 days after the after you're first eligible to claim. OK.
[1 hours 8 seconds][Customer] : So I'll have to if I haven't.
[1 hours 16 seconds][Agent] : Hmm.
[1 hours 10 seconds][Customer] : I'm just thinking if I haven't got any, you know, sickness leave or holiday leave that I can take at work. So say if it is 2 weeks, I think I've got two or three days covered at the moment, but if it's longer than that then I'll just have to just take the three days off I suppose and go back to work. That's what I'm thinking.
[1 hours 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. So with that, David. Time frame like a spell depending on on the waiting period you have on your policy, you have 30 days, so your first payment would be approximately 30 days after the end of your waiting period. And when you put down a claim, so you we do have a in house claims team.
[1 hours 56 seconds][Customer] : Like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 hours 54 seconds][Agent] : They will take you through the process with the simplific in mind to begin with the process, you just have to call us and then we'll have a claim agent that will be assigned to you to manage your claim as well. Alright. Hmm.
[1 hours 1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : I mean, he did sort of say to me over the phone, but he said we'll discuss it more when I see you in his room next week.
[1 hours 1 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Hmm.
[1 hours 1 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : He said we can either go one or two ways. It all depends on the CT that I had yesterday. If we can't do the both kidneys in the one procedure, he'll do the one that's causing, of course, the most pain and the most obstruction first.
[1 hours 1 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Hmm.
[1 hours 1 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Because I didn't have pain until about two weeks ago.
[1 hours 1 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK. Yeah, I did.
[1 hours 1 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : So I didn't even know they were there, you know.
[1 hours 1 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah.
[1 hours 1 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : So The thing is that if he does the left one and like it was done before, then it's only a 24 hour, 48 hour thing and I was back to work within two days.
[1 hours 1 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, I'm glad it will go like this. But I did capture the kidney.
[1 hours 1 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yes, But he did say to me, because it's in the two and if the other one is a bigger size in the right at the moment and he doesn't think I'm gonna pass that one because the ultrasound said that there was a 4mm in the right and I three and a bit. I think you said millimeter, but it's broken in the left 1. So it's actually pushing into the kidney and that's where I'm getting the pain from.
[1 hours 2 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, no, OK.
[1 hours 2 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : And that's the one he said he's gonna focus on because it's more dangerous because it's got a point on it. So I can cut your kidney? No, no, neither do I. But he said it should be similar to last time.
[1 hours 2 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'm I'm hope it doesn't happen to you, but yeah, hmm, hmm.
[1 hours 2 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : But he said if I can do the two then that will be fine. But he did ask me are you able to take time off work if we have to put like a temporary stent in or something like that? Because you won't be able to work with the stent in, it's too painful.
[1 hours 2 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, I understand where you're coming from spell. So coming back to the attacks that you have had in the past. So you had one in the previously 8 years ago and that one you currently have at the moment. That is the in total of 2 attacks, correct. OK. And I did capture that attacks in the section.
[1 hours 3 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I've never had them in both before. I've only ever had them in the one kidney. That's the thing. Yeah.
[1 hours 3 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : So, and OK, alright, what I'm gonna do, Donna, I'm gonna go back and reopen the application.
[1 hours 3 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : I mean, it might be fine, but I'm just thinking if he's gonna do the two and I won't know till I've seen, you know, then he might say I might be able to go back, as I said, in two days. But if he decides that it's more difficult when he gets in there to do it or there's some other thing happens that he's got to put, as he said, a stent in or anything like that, and then I've got to go back and have that stent removed after so many weeks I won't be able to work.
[1 hours 3 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : That is what you're trying to think, yeah. Yeah, I understand your concern. I completely.
[1 hours 3 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : And that's what I'm thinking, you know, am I gonna be covered if he doesn't have to do that? That's fine. I won't have to take time off.
[1 hours 4 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[1 hours 4 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : But I just with the 30 days, that's what I'm sort of thinking. I'd have to wait, that's all. Yes.
[1 hours 4 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that is the waiting period of regardless of if you have any condition or not, this is the you have.
[1 hours 4 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : But could I claim? If it does go that way, could I claim and then you assess it like I do with the health insurance? Or do I just not even apply?
[1 hours 4 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So no, you can call us as well.
[1 hours 4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[1 hours 4 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : And we do have a, we'll have a claim agent that will be assigned to you to manage and they will take you through the claim process as well.
[1 hours 4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, hopefully.
[1 hours 4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[1 hours 4 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : I've got some sick days off, but I think when I asked two weeks ago, they said I'd only have about 3 days accrued at the moment because I've just taken off a whole lot in January.
[1 hours 4 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, that's OK. I understand and I thank you for letting me know. But just hold on for one second. I'm just making sure that I have, I'm capturing the right attack in the system. So just give me one second.
[1 hours 4 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I know.
[1 hours 4 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Let me reopen the application.
[1 hours 4 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : It's just making it more complicated, but I know.
[1 hours 5 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : No, you're not.
[1 hours 5 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah.
[1 hours 5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : I'm just trying to see because when you put through the claim, I just don't want it to go through any hassles.
[1 hours 5 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : And as I said, you know, it's just me and I bring in the income. I'm the sole income.
[1 hours 5 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. I unders.
[1 hours 5 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : And if I can't work, then it's gonna put my express on me.
[1 hours 5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Of course. Of course. Do not. Please hold the line for me for one second. I'll be right back, please. Thank you.
[1 hours 5 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : So yeah.
[1 hours 7 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for holding the line there, Donna.
[1 hours 7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No worries.
[1 hours 7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Umm, uh, so Donna, I reopened the application form for you and coming back to the kidney stones that you mentioned, you said before it was just one kidney stone, but this time it came back and, and the both kidney like. OK.
[1 hours 7 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : No, Yep, yeah, it's, it's in two. Sorry, I meant so that's in one in each.
[1 hours 7 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's coming back to the attacks. So how many attacks have you had? You had three options. One is 1-2 and three plus.
[1 hours 7 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Well, this is the second one, yeah. Second attack, yes.
[1 hours 7 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : But the second attack, it happened on the both kidneys, right? So that'd be like 3 in total.
[1 hours 7 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So if you look that that way, this is different to the last time.
[1 hours 7 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, but this time it is both kidney and last time it was just one kidney.
[1 hours 7 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 hours 7 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So that'll be 3, three in total.
[1 hours 7 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Oh, you're classifying it as three. OK. Yeah, alright. I didn't know that.
[1 hours 7 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : No, no, that's OK. I'm just making sure that you, we are capturing everything as accurate as possible. OK, But I'll go recheck with the manager again. Just making sure I'm capturing.
[1 hours 8 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, yeah.
[1 hours 8 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Just please hold the line.
[1 hours 8 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : But there's no nothing, you know, urgent that needs to be done. As you said, it's not like it's life threatening or anything at the moment. But he might decide just to do the left where I've got all the pain 1st and let the other one go 'cause it might pass in the other one, you know.
[1 hours 8 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Of course, of course, of course, other one might pass. Yeah, of course.
[1 hours 8 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 hours 8 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : I hope it does go along this way, but just making sure I'm capturing.
[1 hours 8 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Oh, it'd be good if they if they don't pass, you get it done at one operation, if that's the way you're thinking.
[1 hours 8 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. So then please hold the line for me for one second. I'll be right back. Thank you. Thank you, Donna, for your patience. Sorry.
[1 hours 11 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 hours 11 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Coming coming back to that kidney stones to so we're going to capture the attacks again. So how many attacks have you had? 123 plus, yeah.
[1 hours 12 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Well, if you're classifying the attack as like a single episode, like with the first one or 'cause this is a different 1 completely.
[1 hours 12 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So both of the kidneys, you have that this time attacks happen at the same time, correct? OK.
[1 hours 12 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : So yes, But it wasn't previously, so this isn't, this is totally different this time.
[1 hours 12 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So that's OK. That's OK. So both of the attacks have occurred at the same time, plus you had a previous attack. So based on that, how many attacks have you had?
[1 hours 12 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Well, I've only had two, but you're possibly classifying it as three because this is a different situation. Is that right?
[1 hours 12 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : 123 plus two OK, no, no, no, I was I was wrong. I don't know because I was thinking like both of the kidneys umm could be classified as a one itch. But since you mentioned the both of the kidney stones attack happened at the same time this time. So the attacks would rules go through as one attack because it didn't happen separate time, correct?
[1 hours 12 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's right.
[1 hours 13 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[1 hours 13 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, but the other previous attack was only in one kidney.
[1 hours 13 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : So so one kidney. That's OK. So so you had one attack in the past and this time you had another attack, correct.
[1 hours 13 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yes, so that's true.
[1 hours 13 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : On the both kidneys, 2 OK, beautiful. So you did capture 2. That's not a problem. Thank you.
[1 hours 13 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[1 hours 13 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So much trickier. Sorry.
[1 hours 13 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Is that your questions are a little bit hard to understand that. So it's like how are you? How are you sort of working it out? You know what I mean?
[1 hours 13 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : No, I'm S Yeah, I understood. My apologies if I was going through back and forth and make you a bit confused. My apologies. Uh, big, beautiful.
[1 hours 13 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : No, because I know that you could look at it as is it similar to last time where it's just one stone in one kidney, then this is the second attack of that situation, but this is different.
[1 hours 13 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we did capture that as a second attack. So we did capture both attacks on the same application.
[1 hours 13 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[1 hours 13 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So with the coming back to the questions that you had, so with the, umm, kidney stones, you don't have any exclusions added.
[1 hours 14 minutes][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[1 hours 14 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK Umm, so if you put through a client a successful claim and you do have to serve the waiting period which is 30 days plus umm David A as well. So your first payment would be umm, 60 days after your first eligible to claim. OK.
[1 hours 14 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the if so, I wouldn't be covered for this attack. That's what I'm trying to get at.
[1 hours 14 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : And I did so if you can't work due to this reason, the kidney stones removed, you can give us a call and our, our, our claim agent will take you through the process.
[1 hours 14 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. That's all. Yeah.
[1 hours 14 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : But as I say to you, you won't be able to receive the money straight away. You do have to go through and wait for the waiting period. OK, you, you have to set up the waiting period and plus you're paid your income bill is paid monthly in areas.
[1 hours 14 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The pity.
[1 hours 14 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So this means you do have.
[1 hours 14 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : I didn't think of it, you know, months ago. Then I probably would have been covered for this one.
[1 hours 15 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, but that's OK. You can also give us a call and then we can take you through the process from there. And I did ask, give you the exclusions, umm, for the Crohn's disease, based on the Crohn's disease, umm, answer that you give it to me.
[1 hours 15 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
[1 hours 15 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So no benefit will be payable for any disability, condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to arising from Crohn's disease as well.
[1 hours 15 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, I got that.
[1 hours 15 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : That exclusion has been added to the application.
[1 hours 15 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : So if anything else happens like, you know, tendonitis or something that I get from, you know, whatever, then I know I'm covered. I understand with the crime, just considered a, you know, a long term sort of complicated issue.
[1 hours 15 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Thank you, thank you and yeah, thank you. And the premium also has adjusted due to the Crohn's disease and a fortnightly payment, it is $92.62 per fortnight. That will become a manageable for you, correct? Perfect.

[1 hours 16 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.

[1 hours 17 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yes, Thursday is my pay. Yeah, yes. So yes, two weeks from yesterday.
[1 hours 17 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, so yesterday was 31st of October and next Fortni 14 to which is coming up on the 14th in my calendar, 14th of November.
[1 hours 17 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yes, that's right.
[1 hours 17 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Would that be suitable for you?
[1 hours 17 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes.
[1 hours 17 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, we can do that. And for the payment, don't know. We work in a direct debit system. So every fortnightly basis we're gonna deduct the premium from your account.
[1 hours 17 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, good.
[1 hours 17 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and we can work in a BSP and account numbers way or we can do it the Visa or MasterCard way as well. Either way you do, there's no such as. How would you like to do it? OK.
[1 hours 17 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Well, The thing is that when I had an incident with my health insurance, I used to take it out on the card, but they had problems always taking it out of the card because they were having updates and I was it was getting missed payments on a direct debit. So I changed it to a BSB and account and it's worked every time.
[1 hours 17 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it works better. Perfect. We can go through with the BSP and account number as well. Is that savings?
[1 hours 18 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I don't know why with why it wouldn't do it with the card, but it just not like it missing payments. And it was just, I was getting behind and I thought no.
[1 hours 18 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Oh, you have to just write it down and to make up those payments. Hmm.
[1 hours 18 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : And then they double up the payments and then they tell me, oh, it didn't go through and it the money was in there.
