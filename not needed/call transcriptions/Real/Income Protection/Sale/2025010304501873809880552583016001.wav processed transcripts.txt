Any advice I provide is general nature may not be suitable to your situation and we need, we spoke just briefly initially and you're up to your annual pre tax income. Have you managed to find out what your annual pre tax income is?

[1 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Uh, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[1 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[1 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK. So basically your duties that you answered first earlier and your income, you can select anywhere from $1000 up to the maximum of $3800. So this is the amount that we would pay you per month if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer loss of income. So when you look at your specific bills and living expenses that you're required per month, how much do you feel would be a suitable amount that you'd like to list as a benefit amount?
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : So what was the maximum available?
[1 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : The maximum would be then $3800.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : It's per month, right?
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, per month. Yeah, that's fine.
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : In the event of a claim, that's what we would pay you per month and beneath.
[1 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : But actually I think the annual income it's, I couldn't go through that properly. Like I, I, I don't think that it is my maximum amount which I received last year. So what if, if there is a difference in this year?
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, you can certainly review it. So that's not a problem. You can just give us a ring apply to have your policy reviewed at that time, definitely.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : So can we review the insurance or it will be, it's going to be the same forever, yeah. Yeah, I think so.
[2 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So based of your last, let's say last two years of income as your occupation is 6, uh, well, last year based of last year's annual income before taxes is a 65,155 current your gross before tax.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : I just had a look, but I think it's more than that. I don't know. I don't predict.
[2 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So the hmm, so we're looking at your gross.
[2 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : So it should be there in my. Yeah, it should be there in my cats. You know it might go up, right?
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Umm, correct, only if you're like, if you have pay slips every every fortnight or monthly, you can check like for that your July and you're looking at July pay slip. It should tell you what you've paid, uh, what you've been paid as a gross. Yeah, yeah, of course.
[3 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : But yeah, OK, alright, just a moment if we can just oh, today until today, right?
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So looking at we based off the annual income before tax. So if you're gonna look at, you know, last year July, that should give you your your enough enough yearly income for last year last financial year.
[3 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Hang on a moment. Just hold on a minute.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So I should, umm, I should look for this order slip of last July or no?
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. And your last financial year statement would be around in July or end of July?
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine. I think. I think that should be fine. I'll just ring you back in case if I find an exact, you know, amount.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yes, OK, so you have to send us to leave your annual income before tax is 65,155 for the moment.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. Now the next two options that you need to select for your income protection policy. There beneath is your waiting period and the benefit. In your policy. I'll explain what these are. The waiting period basically is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Umm now please be. Please keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. OK, so which waiting period would you like to select for you? 30 days or 90 days? Just keep in mind 90 days is cheaper as it has a longer waiting period. OK, umm.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : How cheaper is it? I mean if I choose 30, suppose if I just 10 and suppose if I choose 90 and how much difference it can cost?
[6 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : I can show you, yeah, definitely. So I just have to show that I can only show the difference in price at the end of the application because I know we'll give you the final terms and then we can change that and show you the difference. But for now, which one did you feel would be the best situation for your your current lifestyle? 30 days or 90 days?
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Oh, and then, oh, yeah, that's fine. Nothing to do. Still keep it up. Ready.
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : 30 days, OK, so if you like, for example, if people have like, you know, sick leave, annual leave that they can use in that time of their savings or a partner that can support them, the 90 option is or another option there available. Umm, you know, again, if you feel like that you don't have that the 30 days, there's something that you can go for. Obviously it's up to you at the end of the day, but I'll leave it at 30. If you wanna change it to look at 90 at the end, I'll show you the difference.
[6 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, Umm. Now the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that you that we will pay the income benefits for anyone injury or illness for you that you can choose six months, one year, two years or five years. Which benefit.
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : I will keep that as maximum possible.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Would you like me to to show you one, to quote you, I'm sorry, five year cover. Sure.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Five year benefit.
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : That means I'll get that benefit.
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : To a maximum of five years.
[7 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : I'll get that payment If something happens to me, then you'll get the payment for three, three years, 05 years, right? Yeah.
[7 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Maximum of five years until, you know, if you go back to work, then the payments stop, obviously. OK.
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, of course, yeah.
[7 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. Now I'll show you this indicative quote for you that we have now. Then we can take you through the health and master questions and check if you're eligible. We'll just see if it's in your price range and then we can move forward. So with the monthly benefit amount of the maximum available of $3800, with the waiting period of 30 days and a benefit period of five years, $4.00 premium is $74.56 a fortnight.
[7 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Oh, 74 per fortnight.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Correct, Sir? Yep, $74.56 per fortnight for the the options you've selected there. If you've got 90 days, for example, I'll show you the difference. That one will be $49.79 a fortnight.
[8 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yeah, that's too cheaper than that's way better than that previous one.
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Then obviously if you adjust the five years to let's say 2 years and 90 days, then it comes even more cheaper to $31.82 a fortnight.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : How much it comes comes to if it is three years?
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So 90 days and two years is $31.82 a fortnight.
[8 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : And that's just a $10 difference than this previous quote. I believe so. Oh yeah, suppose I think because I usually take away salary in a month approximately almost 5 to $6000 usually. So the figure which I have given is not a correct I believe because after tax I take away home take home almost $6000 in a month, you know.
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, Yeah, yeah, OK. Yeah. So you, you, you'll definitely be, you know, earning more than annually based with that. Umm, so you're not able to look at your July pay slips.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, July 2024, July first look, right?
[9 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Correct, Yeah. So that should show you your gross of your last financial years, how much you've paid in gross amounts in the last financial year, which will give you the total before tax.
[9 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I just went through the my go up, but it's not giving it correct figure I believe.
[9 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So would you say, you know after tax you're earning about $8000 a month? So before tax, sorry, before tax about $8000 a month. So you said 6000.
[9 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : So I'll just yeah, 3 after times I'm mining almost yeah, $66,000. Yeah.
[10 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yes, I'm talking about before test.
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : So the gross 100 would be around Yeah, I think almost 8000.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[10 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, because I work more hours. I mean, I work more than 100 hours a whole night. Mm Hmm.
[10 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So, OK, so do you wanna do you wanna again you can adjust the monthly, the annual income before tax with me. Now which one would you like to leave it at 90,000 or 95,000? What are you comfortable with? What do you feel comfortable with? What are you 95,000?
[10 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : We'll just put up 95,000, I believe, yeah.
[10 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Sure not a problems. So based on that then you can now choose anywhere from $1000 up to the maximum of $5541.00 of monthly benefit amounts Sir.
[10 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK. That's the amount which we are going to get. There won't be any deduction in that, right.
[10 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Correct. Yeah.
[11 minutes][Customer] : OK.
[10 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : So we pay that to you directly in the event of a claim per month. Yeah. So there's no 2-3 year benefit. There's one year. So sorry, there's six months, one year, two years or five years.
[11 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : If you keep it three years, OK. If you keep it 90 days and two years and how much comes it comes with comes as.
[11 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : And you have the maximum monthly benefit amount. Yeah. So that would be $46.41 a fortnight.
[11 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah, that that should do.
[11 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Five years, then it comes up to 70. Check that. So it's $72.61 a fortnight.
[11 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : And what if it is five years and 90 days?
[11 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 90 days, yeah.
[11 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK. So that will be including any terminal illness also in case and accidents and what are the including and inclusions and exclusions in this? Mm, hmm. Mm hmm.
[12 minutes][Agent] : So as I said, uh, on a previous call, so the cover, it covers you if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income, OK?
