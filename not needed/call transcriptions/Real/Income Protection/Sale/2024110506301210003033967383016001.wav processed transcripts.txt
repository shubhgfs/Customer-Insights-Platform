[54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. I mean that's what I'm calling about. And was it to cover anything specifically, are you paying off any of your loans like a mortgage, anything like that at the moment? Yeah, Yep.
[1 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Just more of in general income protection, 'cause we do have one, but it it's more of a a budget typo policy and the the premium's low, but then again the benefits are low as well.
[1 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Ah, gotcha. Yeah, no, no worries that that's all right. And so that's what kind of sparked an interest. And if you are replacing an existing policy, we recommend that you don't cancel it. If the application has been approved, you have reviewed this policy. Of course, it may not be identical to existing cover. And you should also consider the benefits that may apply or waiting periods that may start again. So as you know, income projection, this is a monthly income benefit paid directly to you. If you're unable to work due to disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. So it's decided to help cover your bills and any costs if your salary is interrupted. You can apply if you work at least 15 hours or more, or at least 15 hours per week in paid employment. James, what? What do you do for a living?

[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : We don't do actually 100%, but the maximum is 70% of your monthly recession income. So we can do eight and a half, $1000 so and so we'll just base the quote off that for now.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : And we can always have a look at 50% of your monthly pre tax income as well because it's $144,000 / 12.

And also the waiting if it's a non pay period that you must wait before the income benefits payable as an insurance event, you can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. Meaning if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first pay will be 60 days after your first eligible claim. Which waiting period would you like me to select?
[6 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : 60 days.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : OK do you mean 30 days?
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Sorry. Thir 30 days.

Would you like me to select?
