[3 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Let me just bring that up for you and then we'll get started. So these are some questions around your duties on what you do. So before answering any of our questions, that is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your cover at claims time. OK, so all you need to do for me kindly just give me a yes or over these questions.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Do you work? I know I asked you 20 hours, my apologies is actually 15. So do you work 15 hours or more per week? Yes or no?

[5 minutes][Customer] : No, no.
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Those were the end of those questions I needed to ask you firstly. So that's all done now. The income benefit amount, uh, before we talk, before we get into a little bit more, I just want to know a little bit about your situation. But it's just that when it comes to income protection, people give me different reasons. Some people talk about their ongoing mortgage payments they're concerned about are just their own personal expenses, car bills, insurance bills. So what sort of bills are you concerned about?
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Not really concerned about me bills it's just I just need it for work.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK. It's part of your business portfolio, it's a requirement.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it's a requirement.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK. I understand. We get that as well sometimes. So that's fine. So we offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income starting from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. And the way we do it at our end, it's very easy. You just need to answer some very simple yes or no health and lifestyle questions over the phone with me so I could check if you are approved and if so, on what terms.
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : We can also cover plan and thank you. And remember, once it is in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[6 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : And Glenn, kindly keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS. And go ahead. It may be helpful for you to know as well that premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible as well, which can make it even more cost effective for you.
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right. Yeah.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : RO roughly around mid-july we will set out the end of your financial statement for you so you can provide it to your tax representative.
[6 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that perfect. Sounds good.
[7 minutes][Agent] : OK thank you. OK, now I know you've already answered this, but just for the recording, are you currently employed or self-employed?
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Self-employed.
[7 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. So I need to work on your pre tax income with you. So for you, pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts, less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. So Glen, this is the amount that the business would otherwise seize earning in the event you were unable to work due to its stability. So take a moment and tell me what's your yearly pre tax? What should I put in? OK, So what are you comfortable in putting in your? I can't take a range, So what should I put in?
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Averages between 190 and 250, so 220.
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Two 2200 and $20,000 cover right?
[8 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Easy. So based on your duties and income, right, I can see that you can choose a monthly benefit amount starting from $1000 and you can go up to $12,833, OK? Now I do understand this is a requirement that you need in regards to what you do, but I just want to ask you that if your salary was interrupted, if your income was interrupted, how much would you need from us on a monthly basis?
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's got a maximum.
[8 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : You could just minimum, midway, maximum, whatever you want, maximum is $12,833. OK, I'll bring that up but then let me know if you need to drop it. OK, Now the other two factors that I need you to understand as well as our waiting period and benefit. So the waiting period plan is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[9 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Now you can choose 30 days or 90 days and please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So what do you prefer? Claim 30 days. So like this. Keep in mind the longer waiting period you select, the cheaper the premium will be.
[9 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'll try to tell you guys.
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Awesome.
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : I'll need the money.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a problem. And the other factor, the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefits for anyone injury or illness. Now you can choose with us six months, one year, two years or five years. Again, the shorter benefit. You select the chapter cheaper the premiums are. So what should I put in for you?
[9 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : What do you think, 12 months? Yeah, or two years? 12 months?
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : 12 months, one year.
[10 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK. I'll bring that up for you now. The next step then is to take you through those questions that I mentioned before, as the price and any terms of cover is determined on the outcome of these questions.
[10 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : What I mean, Yep, that's correct.
[10 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now this number that I've called you on, 0407138949, this is your best contact number, Glenn and glenn.pedo@hotmail.com. That's an active one. And what's your post code in QLD and the suburb? Yeah. And your address in your MM, Hmm.

Now is that within your budget or should I readjust the numbers to bring it down? Your approval is done so we can make the changes. Now take a moment and tell me. So for example, if you bring your benefit amount down, that'll bring down the payment. If you, uh, extend your waiting period, that'll bring down the payment. Or if you reduce the benefit.
[27 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : A $100 a week.
[27 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Uh, it's uh, $136 per week approximately.

[27 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Hang on a second.
[27 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. Take your time.
[27 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : $136 a week, 136 dollars a week. That's a lot of money. Could you send Drew a the quote onto your e-mail with a reference number for longer or something about six months cover instead of the 12 months and then do it instead of having the full 12,000 come back and say like the 10,000 something. Yeah, it's up to you. And so you can try that.
[28 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : None. Yeah, of course I'm here.
[28 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : It would still be hard, but get a reference number on her and then you might have to say like the $10,000 cover for the month.
[28 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course, ma'am. But of course your approval is done so we can make the adjustments.
[28 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[28 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, so $10,000 monthly benefit. And what about the benefit. And the waiting.
[28 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So if you do the benefit. Come back to just say six months instead of the 12 months.
[29 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Six months and so for 12 months and waiting period is still the 30 days. Is that OK?
[29 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it'd probably be better to keep that one now be.
[29 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, so $10,000 monthly benefit a month, 30 days waiting period, six months, uh, benefit. Let's have a look. Let me get you approved on this and I'll tell you what the price is with the change, OK? Just bear with me because I need to jump back into your obligation. But that's true, OK? You don't have to go through all that again, but I have to do that. Thanks.
[29 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah, yeah. And this, this is all fully tax deductible, isn't it?
[29 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So remember I mentioned earlier plans, uh, premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible as well. And you can, I'm not, I'm, I'm not the right, but I, I don't have any financial background. I'm not allowed to give you any financial advice. You may want to check with your tax representative in regards to whether it's fully, uh, generally, uh, fully tax deductible. OK, so from our end, we do let you be, do send out the and if your financial statement around mid-july and as we and premiums as it says for anchor protection, it's generally tax deductible as well.
[30 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Right there, Right there, yeah.
[30 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Uh. OK, so that's come back approved as well. The application is approved with the below terms. Again, as I said, there is a premium adjustment made uh, based on your disclosure within the application regards to your height and weight and this is due to BMI. So with the change, with the approval and the changes, your fault monthly payment has now dropped down to $191.31 every fortnight.
[30 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
