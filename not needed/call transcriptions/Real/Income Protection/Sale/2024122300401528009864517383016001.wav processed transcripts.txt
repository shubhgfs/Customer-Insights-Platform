[1 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much for your patience here. And I have my colleague Anthony on the line. He'll be able to assist you. Anthony. Just confirming I have completed a flight here on my end. Thank you. Thank you. Hi there, Zachary, it's Anthony from Real Insurance following up with you. How you going today, mate?

[18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, a couple weeks. Yeah.
[21 seconds][Agent] : That's fine. That's not bad at all. Very good. Well, a colleague gave me the rundown. I understand. We're gonna looking. We're gonna be looking at doing or applying for a cancel and replace from the old policy to the new one with some adjustments. All good. Zachary. It is a new call with me. So I just need you to confirm your first name, last name and date of birth. That's it.
[42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it's Zachary Farah, 4th of the 9th, 1992.
[46 seconds][Agent] : Too easy. And of course, you are a male Australian resident. Yes or no?
[51 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[52 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic. So please on all calls are recorded and any advice we provide is general in nature. It may not be suitable to your situation. So we're looking at the income protection cover here for you to just refresh your memory. I mean the cover's there designed to provide a California well, a monthly income benefit paid directly to you. If you are unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income and money can be used in any way you see fit at that point. Now we will just bring up some questions here to assess your current role and see how that's changed. But yeah, we can O as you know, we can offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly free tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. And once it's in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. But please keep in mind there are some exclusions that applies outline in the PDS, of course, as well. As far as the features so far, Zachary, I just wanted to check and we did that. That made sense there.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
[1 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, well let's get these questions done. This is a duty based assessment for your role. So please on all calls recorded and any advice we provided is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. Zachary, before answering any of our questions, it is important you are aware of your duty to answer all of our questions accurately and honestly. Failing to do so could impact your current claims kind. Do you understand this yes or no?
[2 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Zach. First question, do you work 15 hours or more per week, yes or no?
[2 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Is your role a bit administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment, yes or no? Do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle?
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : No, yes.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : And are you qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role?
[2 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : And do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation. Is a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces? Or do you handle explosives? And do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights above 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul? Great. That is successful. And we can bring up the quotes here for you. So I'll just reiterate as well, Zachary, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Makes quite a difference on how much you pay. So that's always good. And Zachary, what we'll do now is establish your employment status and then we'll bring out the numbers and that you figure out, you tell me sort of what level of cover you want this time around.
[3 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, right.
[3 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Are you currently employed or self-employed?
[3 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Self-employed.
[3 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. I'm going to give you a definition of what we mean by pre tax income so you can just tell me annual pre tax income based off that. So pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts, less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. This is the amount the business would otherwise cease earning in the event you are unable to work due to DIS due to disability. That being said, what is your annual pre tax income for us to work off here?
[3 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : 100 a 150,000.
[3 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Awesome, thank you very much. Now Zachary, based on those numbers, then based on your duties and income, you can select a monthly benefit amount from $1000 up to $8750 per month. So what amount would you like me to quote you on?
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : I was look, I'm gonna look at 8000. What? Yeah. What the price come back?
[4 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, 8000, no problem.
[4 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Now the 8000 before we look at the numbers on that, I want to just running past the waiting period, the benefit period of your choice, I mean, so we're all solid there. So, but the waiting period as you know is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is tabled and after the insured event. Now you can choose 30 days or 90 days, but please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you're first eligible to claim. So which waiting period would you like me to select? This one? Yeah, done. Now, the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that will pay the income, benefits anyone, injury or illness. Zachary, which benefit. Would you like me to select? I've got six months, one year, two years or five years.
[4 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : 30 one year.
[5 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : So are you alright? Well, where we're at for the $8000 a monthly benefit amount, 30 days waiting period, benefit.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, we'll go with that.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : One year, Zachary, with all that included, we can do that one for you for $78.23 a fortnight, which works out to be about $39.12 a week, no problem at all. Now, I don't know if you remember from before, but remember your premiums that you pay for the income tax and they're generally tax deductible. So you could take your documentary accountant and they'll tell you, umm, how cost expected that could be for you around tax time anyway, but we'll take care of this one for you. Umm, no, no longer on that process exactly. I'm just gonna take you through the questions. Once that's done, we'll wrap it up and then we'll get you back through to our service team to apply for the cancel replace.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. No worries.
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So nice and easy 280. So with the questions, I'm going to read you a small free underwriting disclosure staying at the same end up first, then we'll go through with you. The PO Box I'm assuming is still the same for the postal address, PO Box 396 Kerrang. Yep. And that's Victoria 3579 for the post code.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : And now I'm sure you would have gone over this the last time you talked with us initially, but I just want to refresh your memory as well. Your premium is steps, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. I'll give you an indication so you're not left in the dark here using our premium projection tool anyway. Exactly. That's as an indication. If you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $80.17 a fortnight. But you can also find information about our premium structure on our website too.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Just thought I'd give you a heads up there. So questions all that's left to do just clear yeses no. It's take about 5-6 minutes. I'll read it as pre underwriting disclosure statement and we'll go into them. So it really. Please be aware all calls are recorded for quality monitoring purposes.

[7 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yes, No.
[8 minutes][Agent] : Yes or No2 of you didn't mention to you as well, including your policy is a rehabilitation benefit along with a final expenses benefit, that debt component exactly which pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away to assist with funeral costs and any other final expenses.
