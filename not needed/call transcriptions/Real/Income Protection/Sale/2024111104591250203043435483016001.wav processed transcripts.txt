Uh, we offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. It's very, very easy for you to apply.

[3 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep.

[10 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : The waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days, but keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears.
[10 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : OK. MMM.
[10 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So which waiting period would you like me to select?

[11 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Do you mean in the price or we can have a look, We can have a look at different ones for you can change around that quote. Is there one you'd like to look at to start with?

[19 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : OK, No, it would be enough, no.
[19 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. So I'm just loading this one up now and congratulations, you absolutely flew through that. It was approved with no changes. So guys, we'll take you through that quote now and then we'll discuss some options. We can play around with it. Umm, you just let me know how that sounds because I'm happy to go through as many quotes as you need, but based on the MM, hmm.
[20 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah. Sorry.
[20 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : No problem.
[20 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : No, keep going. Sorry.
[20 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, OK, no problem. So for the income benefit of $8000 with a 30 day waiting period and the 60, sorry, the one year benefit. You'd be looking at a fortnightly premium of $82.11. Now also with this policy, there is a rehabilitation benefit along with the final expenses benefit, which pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away. Did you Washington did that when they say how much it would be affordable? Or did you want to have a look at some other amounts?
[20 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : No2 grand a week pays for everything that we need. So that amount I'm signed with. But just wondering benefit wise, SO1US82, how much is so five years?
[21 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[21 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Just, you know, if it's an option. Really.
[21 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Just give you an idea.
[21 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[21 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : If we were to adjust it to the five year benefit. That would work out to be $136.97 a fortnight and that's obviously keeping it with the $8000 benefit amount and the 30 day waiting period. If it were a six month benefit. That would reduce that premium to $70.00 and $50 a fortnight.
[21 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : And just with income protection, does that cover say, if you're laid off from work, you know, say that business goes bankrupt or something as well? Or is it 94 if you have an injury and you have to be home?
[21 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So it doesn't cover that.
[21 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : No.
[21 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : It specifically covers if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income as a result of that.
[21 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[21 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Now at this stage, whi which of those benefit periods was sounding like the most suitable level of cover? Sure.
[22 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : I'd probably go one. Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm just at work and someone just walked in. So can you organise something through e-mail from here on or?
[22 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : So I can definitely e-mail you through the quote, we'll discuss all your options. I won't take up too much more of your time. There's just a couple more things I did need to let you know of.
[22 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[22 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Now with this policy, obviously your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. As an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $84.17 per fortnight, so approximately just over a $2.00 increase.
[22 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : MMM MMM.
[22 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : I mean, you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. Umm, because you have been fully approved for the cover address, this does actually allow us to get you covered over the phone today. What that would actually mean though, is that we'd be able to get the proper policy documentation sent out so that you can sit down and have a good read through it. Make sure we're happy with everything to do with that cover. Even though you get the Peace of Mind you're covered, we're not actually gonna ask you to pay anything until the day that you choose. If you did end up looking through it all and you changed your mind for any reason, that's fine. There's no cancellation fees. You do actually have a 30 day cooling off.
[23 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : This one.
[23 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So if you cancel within that 30 days then you receive a full refund of any premiums paid, unless of course the claim has been made, but obviously in touch with that's not the case.
[23 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I know. That's great.
[23 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'll just confirm. I've got that e-mail address hereasandy_ninety_6@hotmail.com is that.
[23 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's the point. Yeah.
[23 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Still correct beautiful and? We've. Got two contact numbers here we've got.
[23 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's my one. Yeah, that's my wife's phone number.
[23 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : This 10411686399 is yeah but, we've, also got 0478761131 would you.
[24 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, you can do that. Yeah, that's fine.
[24 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Like to keep that on the profile as well yeah not? A problem now as I mentioned, even though you would be covered from say we're not actually asking you to pay anything until the day you choose, What day would you like me to note down for the first payment day?
[24 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : I don't know if it can coincide with the with the other insurance.
[24 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, let me have a look.
[24 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : So you do it in in one day. Yeah, sure.
[24 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So that obviously still be two separate payments just because it is still a separate policy, but we can absolutely have it come out the same day. Your next payment is due on the 15th of November, so this coming Friday for the life cover. Did you want to link this one up to that same day?
[24 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, you can do that. That's fine.
[24 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : No problem. Now for security reasons though, I don't have access to your bank because they get encrypted, so not everyone can actually see that kind of information. What would you like us to note down? A BSB, an account number, or a Visa or MasterCard?
[24 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : You can do the DSD and all that.
[24 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yep.
[24 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : But yeah, can you please send it through in an e-mail because I really have to find out. Paper stamping up here.
[25 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, well what I can do for you. Obviously without the policy in place, there is no proper policy documentation to send you. I can e-mail you through that quote with some information if you have to go and we can't note those details down. Now at least I can e-mail you the quote because we have gone through the whole application. For yourself though, if you decide you're happy with it, you can set it up through that e-mail. You just click the buy now button and then follow the prompts from there. Just to let you know though, if it does ask for a password to access the information, the password is your date of birth, so all 8 digits. What I'll do for you if we haven't had anything via that e-mail this evening, I'll touch base with you tomorrow and we can organize this. One of the finest. If obviously you haven't done it via e-mail. If you do it by e-mail, avoids that call back anyway.
[25 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Cool. No, I'll do it all through e-mail later this afternoon. Alright.
[25 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's perfectly fine. Well, it was lovely speaking with you, Andreas.
[25 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Alright. All good.
