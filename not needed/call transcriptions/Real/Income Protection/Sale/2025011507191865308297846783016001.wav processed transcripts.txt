[5 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, so, so this is actually asking quite specifically though, Seth in the last 12 months. And uh, in that case, so if you try to think back to the best of your knowledge, right? And it's based on, on how you respond. So if you think like when you did quit, umm, if I could confirm specifically. So have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Is what we need to know that. OK. And your your current employment status mate, can I confirm are you currently employed or self-employed?
[5 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : I yeah, yeah, I'm currently employed, yeah.
[5 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : And the reason why we ask that this that is we can so that we can help determine what level of coverage you can apply for. We need you to confirm what your annual pre tax income is. Now before you answer that being employed pre tax income is the total annual remuneration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses, excluding super contributions. So just to confirm there, but what is your annual pre tax income, please?
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : The memory was 40 grand.

So Seth, there's also a waiting period that to let you know with these options here and how that works. The waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. Now letting you know that you can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in Arise. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be six days after you're first eligible to claim. So given the 30 or the 90 day option there Seth, which way we could would you like them to select for yourself there?
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I'll just take the monthly. Thank you.
[7 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : The monthly isn't the 30 day option.

Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So it shows here that you can actually select starting from six months, a one year, A2 year or A5 year option. So to confirm, which benefit. Would you like to select for yourself there, Sir?
