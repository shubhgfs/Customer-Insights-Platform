[59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, well, the last one, yeah, yeah, I, I sent through an e-mail as well to more because before I used to, to pay for my sort of a funeral cover.

[1 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : And I want to uh, uh, continue with that, uh, with that one as well.
[1 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem. So just in regards to what you've put through on our website, you put a request through for income protection. Are you wanting to look at income protection?
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[1 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So I don't have anything to do with like existing policies or reinstating them.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, alright, too easy.
[1 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So we can have a look at that at the end for you regarding your existing policy. But it was definitely a cover you had with real, OK, because it's just come through in a different profile. So let me have a look and see if I can find you in our system. Sorry, bear with me. Sorry. It won't be long.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, Yep, that's alright.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : One, 300-0785. Was that the number? I just told you that? OK, so just in regards to that one there, umm, I'm not too sure obviously whether you can reinstate it.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : What I'll need to do is pop you in a quick hold and just check with our support department for you.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[3 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, won't be too long. Thank you so much for holding, Jonah.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : You're welcome. Yep. Yep.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : So I was just looking to look there just because it did lapse back in May, you're not actually eligible to reinstate that policy. So if you're wanting a funeral insurance, you'll have to take out a new policy.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : OK. Yeah. No, that's fine. Yep.
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So we can definitely help you out with that today.
[5 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : And you're also looking at income. Is that right?
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yep.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : You're wanting both policies.
[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem at all. What I'll do for you now because the funeral insurance is a little bit more straightforward. We'll go through that one for you first with the income protection, there's extensive like health and lifestyle questions and and things like that we've got to take you through. So we'll go through the funeral insurance and I think quickly because it's something you've had before, so you know a bit about it and then we'll do that income as well. Now with the funeral insurance that it's, it is designed to provide a cash benefit anywhere from $3000 up to $15,000. It's paid out directly to your loved ones when you pass away.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Umm, and because it's cash benefit, it doesn't have to go just towards your funeral expenses.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, sorry. What's that?
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sorry. So because it's a cash benefit, it doesn't have to go just towards your funeral expenses. It can also go towards any other final expenses that may have been left behind, like unpaid bills. Perfect.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Oh, because the reason why I took it because I didn't want to leave any burden for my family when something when I passed away.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect.
[6 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Oh, good, good.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : That's exactly what it's designed for us to give you that Peace of Mind. Now, just so you know, for the 1st 12 months you will be covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months you'll be covered for death due to any other 'cause as well.
[6 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : If at any time during the policy you do pass away due to an accident, your benefit amount will triple. But this policy also has a terminal illness benefit, which means after holding your policy for 12 months, if you were first diagnosed with a terminal illness with 12 months or less to leave by a medical practitioner, we'll pay the claim out in full while you are alive. And that money can be used to help with things like your medical expenses. Uh, also a couple of things to note. So your premiums are designed to stay the same as you get older. And when you reach the age of 85, your premiums will cease. So you'll have nothing more to pay. But you'll also automatically receive a 25% bonus cover, which will be applied to your benefit amount. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website. But the policy also has an early cash out option. So at any time after you reach 85 years of age, you can choose to end your cover and we'll pay you 75% of the funeral insurance benefit. And you may pay more in total premiums over the life of the policy than the benefit amount. But also please be aware this insurance does not have a savings or investment element. So what that means is if you cancel this outside of the 30 day cooling off. The cover stops and you won't receive anything back. Now just before we take you through pricing, have you got any questions or is it all pretty straightforward so far?
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep. All good.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Fantastic. Well, let's take you through some pricing.
[8 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : I'll go for the same one.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : I can't see what you were covered for, but you can choose anywhere.
[8 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Alright, that's Fif 15.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful.
[8 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : We'll have a look at that 15,000 to start with. We can always work our way down to all the way down to 3000.
[8 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Alright, Yep.
[8 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So let me know how that 15,000 sounds and if you do wanna look at this. But full $15,000 of the funeral cover with that tripling to $45,000. If you pass away due to an accident, you'd be looking at a fortnightly premium of $32.29.
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's fine. I'll do that.
[9 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Well, what we'll do, The great news is we can organize to get you covered for that policy over the phone today.
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Mm. Hmm.
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Means we'll get all the proper policy documentation sent out for you to sit down, have a good read through to make sure you're happy with it all.
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Uh, but you can still choose a day in the future for the first payment day. If you end up looking through it all and you change your mind for any reason, that's fine. There's no cancellation fees. You don't look into this and you do have a 30 day cooling off. So if you cancel within that 30 days, you get a full refund of any premiums you may have paid.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes, I want to start tomorrow.
[9 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Unless of course, yeah, sure. And that was unless a claim has been made. But yeah, that's no problem. So either way, you'll be covered from today, But if you want your first payment tomorrow, that's fine. Umm, I'll just confirm a couple more of your details, but are you happy to continue?

By contacting us, you have agreed to take out a single real funeral cover with the following cover. Jonah Core Tamana Loco is covered for $15,000 in the event of death. In the case where that is accidental or if you suffer a defined accidental serious injury, the benefit amount will triple coverage for accidental death only for the 1st 12 months of cover, with death by any cause or diagnosis of a terminal illness covered thereafter. Accidental Serious Injury cover for each Life Insured Underage 75 starts immediately and ends on the policy anniversary following the life insured 75th birthday. Once a Life insured reaches age 85, you can choose to voluntarily cancel that person's cover to receive a lump sum payment of 75% of the chosen benefit amount. If you take up this early cash out option, you will no longer have the right to claim under the policy for that life insured. This policy is an insurance policy and does not have the savings or investment component. You can end your cover at any time by contacting us. If you stop paying your premiums, we may end your cover, but we will give you notice before doing so. If cover ends prior to age 85, no benefit is payable and there is no refund of premiums after the cooling off. If cover continues beyond age 85, the life insured will receive an additional 25% of bonus cover from that date and you will not be required to pay any further premiums after the cooling off. If cover continues beyond age 85, the life insured will receive an additional 25% of bonus cover from that date and you would not be required to pay any for the premiums. The bonus cover is not payable if the early cash out option has been taken out. Cover for each life insured ends in the day prior to their 100th birthday. We will pay the funeral benefit and bonus cover for the life insured. At this point your total premium for your first year cover is $32.29 per fortnight. Your premiums are level, which means they are designed to stay consistent year on year and will only change if you also you'll cover or the insurer adjust the premium rates applying to your policy. The insurer can only make a change if it is applied consistently across the policy holders. You may pay more in premiums than the benefit amount over the life of the policy included in your.
[18 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : I'm sorry.
[18 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : No, no, that's OK. You're, you're OK to continue. Beautiful. Uh, so included, perfect.

[19 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yes, all good.
[19 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Well, congratulations, Jonna. You're now covered for our funeral insurance again.
[19 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Thank you. Thank you so much.
[20 minutes][Agent] : Yeah, my pleasure if you do think.
[20 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : I I may commit suicide tomorrow now.
[20 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Oh well, well Touchwood, that's obviously never going to happen. But keep in do keep in mind for the 1st 12 months, you're covered for accidental death and accidental serious injury. Only after the first 12 months, you're covered for death due to any cause. But yes, if you think of any questions regarding that one, don't hesitate to give us a call at any time. We'll be happy to help you out. Perfect. Well, it was so, so lovely speaking with you today. You have a fantastic day.
[20 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Okie dokie, thank you so much.
[20 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Alright, thank you. Yes. Oh, the income protection, yes.
[20 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Oh, another thing that was the was it the salary protection or some income protection?
[20 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : So you're also wanting a quote for that one.
[20 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[20 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : OK, So with the income protection, it's designed to provide a monthly income benefit if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. So it's designed to help cover your bills and living costs if your salary is interrupted. And you can apply if you work at least 15 hours per week in paid employment. Now we offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. Uh, it's very easy to apply. We just ask you some help from my style questions over the phone to see if you are approved and if so, on what terms we can offer cover. And once in place, it'll cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Now keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS, but also keep in mind that the premiums for income protection is generally tax deductible, which can make it even more cost effective for you. Now we'll take you through. I need to ask you some questions regarding your duties at work. What's your current occupation?

[22 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sorry for logistics and customer service, Regional coordinator and I'll ask you some additional questions. I can only accept the definite yes or no answer for all of them. Before answering any of our questions, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly tell you to do so could impact your coverage claims time. So do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[22 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[22 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment?
[23 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Right.
[23 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Sure. So what would you say you do the majority of? OK, perfect. So yeah, that's what it's asking.
[23 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Let's bit with that question because I normally, sometimes I, I spend more time in the office some week, but when we're busy sometimes I travel out as well by helping our team in the office in the OK.
[23 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment beautiful. So we can put that a yes for the full question.
[23 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : In the office, Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Is that correct?
[23 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[23 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Are you required to perform any physical duties? Perfect. So is that a yes or no? Sorry.
[23 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Not really, no.
[23 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Wonderful. Do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew? Entertainment industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces? Or do you carry a firearm or handle explosives?
[24 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Nope.
[24 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Don't know. Me too. Don't worry. Now based on SO I also need to confirm for you your employment status. So you're currently employed or self-employed. Are you currently employed or self-employed?
[24 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yes, sorry, I didn't get that one employed.
[24 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. So pre tax income is the total annual remuneration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses excluding super contributions. So what is your annual pre tax income? Yes you know annual beautiful 121,000.
[24 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Adam Yep, 121 then Yep.
[25 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Great. So based on your duties and income you can select a monthly income benefit ranging from $1000 up to a maximum of $7058 per month. What amount would you like me to quote you on?
[25 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Right. What are the amounts that you've got in there?
[25 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So it ranges from $1000 up to a maximum of $7058. So that's the monthly benefit amount you'd receive upon a claim.
[25 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK. And that will be a much within the payment.
[25 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So the payments depended on quite a number of different factors. Obviously the amount we're covering you for, but also your waiting period, benefit. Age, gender, smoking status, uh, your occupational duties and your health and lifestyle questions. So what we're doing now is building that quote for you. Once we've taken you through the questions and everything, we'll be able to take you through the actual pricing.
[25 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[25 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : We're just trying to build that quote so that we can take you through it. So is there a benefit amount you'd like me to quote? You want to start with.
[26 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : So I've got 1000 up then per week. Yep.
[26 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So up to no, this is so this is the monthly maximum benefit ranging from $1000 up to $7058 that you can choose. So that's how much you would be receiving each month. If you're unable to work and you'll you suffer a loss of income. So have you Maybe. So these are monthly, but if you've got a weekly amount, we can have a look at that. But have you thought about maybe how much you would need if, for example, you were no longer working or receiving an income?
[26 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Per week, Per week can be around 2500 a month.
[26 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : 2500 a month.
[26 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. OK. So also with this one you have the option to select different waiting periods and benefit periods depending on your circumstances. The waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. But keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So would you like to look at the 30 or the 90 days?
[27 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : A 30?
[27 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And there's also the benefit. So this is the maximum amount of time that will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. For this one, you can choose either six months, one year, two years or five years.
[27 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Wow, that's hard.
[27 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : We can always play around with it. So these ones you choose now, they're not set in stone.
[27 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[27 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : We can always create that quote. We'll take you through the questions, generate the quote, then we can always play around with it.
[27 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK. Six, six to one year.
[27 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : But is there 1 you want to look at just to start with it? So look at six months or one year. Yeah, OK. We can have a look at that one year to start with and then we've got some room to work with as well. So the next step is to go through those health and lifestyle questions, Jonah, because the price and any terms of cover is determined on the outcome of fee. So we'll go through them over the phone. Now. If you're approved, we'll take you through pricing and then we'll discuss your options and let it go from there. Just before we go through the questions, I need to grab your address. What's your post code?
[28 minutes][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, 0850.
[28 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. So we've got that here, 16 Campbell Terrace catchment. I'll copy that over.
[28 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[28 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. And I've gotta read you through something called a pre underwriting disclosure, then we'll pull these questions up for you so it reads.

There has been a premium adjustment, so an update to the terms of this one based on your BMI. So your premium has adjusted. So we'll go through that for you. Now we'll take you to some pricing. Let me tell it sounds like I mentioned we can always play around with it to find one that is suitable. And there is a limit to the maximum benefit amount and benefit. It's $5000 in two years due to height and weight. So at 125% loading due to BMI or due to health. So for an income benefit of $2500 with the 30 day waiting period and the one year benefit. Your fortnightly premium on this one, Jonah, would be $86.91 a fortnight.

Umm, same thing as with the funeral cover. We'll get all your policy documentation sent out for you to have a good read through. Uh, if you do decide against this one, there's no cancellation fees. You're not locked into this now I, I'll just let you know a couple more things about the income protection as well. So it does actually include a rehabilitation benefit along with the final expenses benefit, which pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away with this policy journey, your premium is set, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. What I want to do is give you an idea of a premium projection.

[41 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
