[15 seconds][Agent] : And this is Mr. Luke Woolen I'm speaking with.
[18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, but is it actually possible to get a call in about an hours time?
[24 seconds][Agent] : And Tom, I mean, I'll be happy to get you. You're calling now this time, that's no problem. You're just busy at the moment, aren't you? Yeah, I got no dramas. I'll, I'll be in touch in an hour's time. But listen, if you do have a couple minutes to spare, umm, wouldn't take too long just to run through some basic details. And obviously if you have to go, if you have to go, that's fine. Umm, yeah. Do you have a couple minutes to spare at this stage?
[29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, easy as that, no problems. Uh, and so, yeah, well, I'm thinking just to run through some details of how it works, get a start here. And obviously if you have to go, then I'll just get into contact with you in an hour. OK? Umm, otherwise, yeah. This is Mr. uh, Luke Woolner speaking with, is that right? And your date of birth I've got here is the 2nd of May 1988, is that right? Good. Uh, just keep in mind that our calls are recorded and any advice providers general in nature, and they'll be similar to your situation. I just asked to confirm you are of course, a male and Josh resident, is that right?
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : All right, no driver's space. Thank you. OK. And just while I get everything arranged here on my end, I would like to get a bit more of an insight into situation going into this loop, uh, because I mean, ultimately what's really done for you this morning? Like what's the reason you decided now is the time to look into some income protection cover?
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep, I just need it for one of the contracts that I'm going for for work.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, right. OK.
[1 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : I think that's worker's comp, but now I've only got myself working for me.
[1 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Right. Got you. OK, there you go. So you I got that you're doing some contractor work then. Yeah. Oh, thank God that and what is your occupation? What do you what's your train?
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep, electrician.
[2 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : I electrician. That's what I meant. No good. I understand. Obviously some of these, uh, kinds of jobs would require, umm, a full of cover like this. So, uh, I'm happy to help out. And obviously how we look at this can be for a few, couple different lenses, whether it is, umm, it's coverage, whether you are in change to make sure that XYZ is covered if you weren't working or if you're just trying to get something that's cheap and just pick the box in the contract for you.
[2 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Pretty much. OK, keep the box.
[2 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Uh, yeah, yeah, there you go. So yeah, yeah, if we're, uh, because we'll put it this way with the income protection cover, uh, what it's designed to do is provide a monthly income benefit paid directly to you and you're unable to work due to the same sickness or injury and as a result suffer lost income. And we offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income. But I say up to, as it ranges between $1000, up to a maximum of $15,000 depending on what you earn and just depending on how much you feel is necessary as well. So, umm, for example, if you didn't actually deal a real need to cover and just want to tick the box in the contract, if you do the minimum $1000 a month, that makes it the cheapest possible. OK.
[3 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[3 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Umm, otherwise though, I mean, if there was, uh, if there was something to happen to you and you're off of work, are there, umm, some expenditures that you are concerned about?
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Oh I look but not really I I have a user like City bank in my card.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, there you go. So you kind of have your own bit of, uh, your own kind of layer protection just for your own savings.
[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need a ticket box.
[3 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, yeah, OK. It is. That makes a lot of sense, right. Well, in that case, we'll be able to take the speedy, the speediest route to, to umm, get this sorted.
[3 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Then from here, effectively what I'll do is, umm, there's many questions I'll run you through about your working duties as well as some health and lifestyle questions. Uh, all of this what its purpose is to determine the eligibility for the insurance, but also the cost, the insurance and other factors. We, what we can offer you cover. Umm, they're mostly yes or no questions. Hopefully we can power if they're nice and easy, umm, and uh, along the way, there are aspects of the cover I'll explain as we go. If you do you have any questions, just feel free to ask me, but just try to cover them as quickly as I can, OK? Umm, otherwise, some small points here. Uh, with this insurance, we can cover you up until the policy anniversary following your 65th birthday.
[4 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : And keep in mind the rest of the exclusions that applies outline the PDS and, and the fact of this, uh, insurance you might find quite useful is that the premiums for this income protection cover are generally tax deductible. Umm, So hopefully that can help out a little bit. Contacts time for you.
[4 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Uh, otherwise we'll get into those questions about what you do work so we can get a start here. Luke, are there any questions you have for me up until this point there? Oh, good day. Uh, so before answering any of our questions, it is important that you're aware of your duty. It's all our questions accurately and honestly as failure to do so, it could impact your current claims on and these just yes or no answer questions.
[4 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : No, Yep.
[5 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Firstly, do you work 15 hours or more per week? Yes or no? Is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature? Will you spend the majority of your time laws in office or clinical environment?
[5 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I do 912. Is it in your office?
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : OK, no worries. So you're mostly, umm, most of your work isn't quite managerial. It is, uh, it is just as part of the trade itself.
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no worries. Well, that's a matter of that question. That's fine. Uh, the next question, uh, do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery, or drive a vehicle as part of your role?
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : I, I so I list everything with you. Sorry.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK. For reference, when we umm speak about heavy physical duties, we're more so umm referring to driving commercial vehicles, operating machinery or carrying, lifting, pushing, pulling or operating heavy machinery.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't do anything with heavy machinery, but I just need something with heavy cake pumps and things. Yep.
[6 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, OK, alright, in that case, that's fine, that's perfectly fine. And umm, oh, I guess another question to ask here is, umm, do you drive like a work you between jobs?
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Umm, while you're working? Yep, no worries. Well, that's yes, then, umm, regardless. And so the next question, uh, are you qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role?
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[6 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Good. And do you work in any of the following fields, aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, armed forces? Or do you handle explosives? And do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights of 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul? Good And one other question here, just more so relating to health and work. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no?
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no.
[7 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Excellent. All right, uh, so they're usually at this point we umm, ask you if you're currently employed or self-employed, but umm, you're working for yourself as a contractor, right? self-employed, Yeah. Good day. So I'm just requiring to let you know, uh, we define as pre tax income. It's your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts. And so unless any business expenses and excluding super contributions, so this is the amount the business would otherwise cease earning in the event you are unable to work due to a disability. Umm, at this point we usually ask what is your annual pre tax income? Do you know that off the top of your head?
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yes, they are 14150.
[7 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, around 140 a 150,000. No worries. Uh, because I mean, well, if we work with $140,000, it means we can offer a monthly benefit anywhere between $1000 all the way up to a maximum of $8166 a month.
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yeah. Yep.
[8 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Uh, but you mentioned you're just looking just to tick the box, just get the cheapest thing possible.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK. In that case, if we, we look at the minimum $1000, that should help us, umm, limit the premium as much as we can. Uh, there are two objectives that go to income protection cover as well that do affect Prem. Uh, they're both in relation to when you make a claim on the insurance. It's the waiting period and benefit.
[8 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Uh, the waiting period is just a non payment period that you must wait before the income benefits payable after the insured event options being 30 days or 90 days. And keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So you choose a 30 day waiting period. The first payment would be 60 days after your first offer the claim. And put it this way, 30 days shorter is gonna be cheap as sorry, more expensive between the two, whereas 90 days being a longer time is gonna be much cheaper for the insurance, Yeah. Uh, would you, would your preference be to look at the 90 days?
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Sure. Alright, then the benefit. It's the maximum amount of time that we'll pay the income benefits anyone injury on illness, the options are being six months, one year, two years or five years.
[9 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Six months being the shortest option here is the cheapest.
[9 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yep. I think I have the minimum 12 months. I'll go 12 months then.
[9 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, it's 12 months handy. I got this. Sorry, uh, just to double check everything before we jump into the, uh, the next set of questions, which is the health and lifestyle questions. Right now, look, we're looking at $1000, the minimum monthly benefit amount, uh, 90 days waiting period, the, umm, cheaper than two and then one year as the benefit.
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[9 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : OK, good day. Uh, in that case, uh, from here, I'm just gonna confirm some of your details while the questions continue loading. Uh, but another part of the insur, a couple of things about the insurance I wanted to let you know of. Uh, we are gonna firstly include what's called the real reward attached to policy. It means following your first policy anniversary dates, we're able to refund you 10% the premiums you're paying that time. And then thank you for staying with real insurance the first year of cover. Uh, and as well with this insurance, there is, uh, no minimum amount of time you have to hold the policy before you can cancel. Look, if it was longer necessary at a point, you can cancel the insurance anytime, OK? Just call our support team. Their cancellation fees are involved.
