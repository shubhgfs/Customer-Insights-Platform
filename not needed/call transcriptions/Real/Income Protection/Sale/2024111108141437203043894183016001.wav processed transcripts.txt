[17 seconds][Customer] : That was pretty quick.
[18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, look, I know, I promise we've got lots to do, but no, we'd just like to be quick with the quiet request there, make sure we can get to our customers. I'm essentially just here to run you through the income protection kind of how it works, you know, how you can cover yourself and so we can offer out to you there as well.
[30 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[33 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. Firstly, mate, just so I can load everything up, I need to let you know our calls are recorded and any advice I provide is generally nature may not be suitable to your situation. We'll just make sure I've got your details correct here as well. So I've got your name down as Brad Murray. Perfect date of birth at 29th of the 10th 2000. Beautiful. And just now to confirm that you're a male and an Australian resident as well.
[46 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[56 seconds][Agent] : OK, awesome. That's everything out of the way there. Appreciate that. I'd love to know as well mate. What's got you looking into the income protection recently?
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Just started working for myself as a sole trader.
[1 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Oh perfect. What do you do for work?
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : So a plumber?
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, right.
[1 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah. She was back and just going out of mind.
[1 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : So obviously I imagine, did you get signed off like a couple of years back or what's the go dodge and just want to go lucky enough to be out on your own? No good stuff.
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Good stuff. I've got a mate, he's a plumber, but he's just working for a company. He wants to go on his own, but I don't know, I guess it's a bit daunting in a sense as well. How's it been for you so far?
[1 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Doing very busy. She's good.
[1 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : That's good, perfect.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's good.
[1 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : And as well-being your own boss, no one to answer to, no very good stuff. Awesome. So I imagine what back when you were like just normally employed, you had this sort of cover like through your employment. Gotcha. And now obviously just want to make sure that it's still there. Knock on wood, anything does happen, especially because you're relying on yourself. It's not really like there's, you know, sick leave, those sorts of things as well.
[1 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Easy done. Well, basically what we go through here, I'll kind of just run you through how this works. It's fairly straightforward. And then rather than going off like a job title, we just go off of a duties based assessment. So it's a couple of yes or no questions about what your requirements are at work makes a little bit more personalized. And then from there you kind of get to choose your own cover in terms of like the benefit. Waiting period and an amount all those sorts of things and we'll run you through a quick application that'll give us the prices final terms, all those sorts of things OK sway that now the main way this works and you may have some knowledge obviously from when you've held something like this or had it like that in the past, but it's there to provide you with a monthly income benefit and it's paid directly to you if you are unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you are suffering a loss of income. So, you know, there to help keep the lights on, sit on the table if your salary is interrupted.
[2 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : I was to ask as well, you know, were you, uh, what's your sort of circumstances? You like renting mortgage? Uh, what's the go there?
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Renting.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Renting got you, umm, obviously being tough there. And was it just you on your own? Did you have a partner supporting your friends or something like that?
[2 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes, I have a partner.
[3 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Got you. OK. I mean even still obviously relying on one of the PE people in relationships income can make things a little bit tight in the sense as well. So no understandably why you want this in place too. Now what we offer, it's an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income. So starting from $1000 minimum up to a maximum of 15,000. It is salary dependent, but we can calculate that on our end here. Not a worry if you haven't been working for yourself for the full year because you can kind of average it out and calculate it from there. The application process super straightforward as well. We just go through some health and lifestyle questions. We don't have to get any bloods done or go for a full medical. We just do that to check your approval now if you are. We'll also be able to determine on how we can offer the cover now once it's in place, If you're happy with it, it'll protect you into your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. There so long long way away.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Awesome. The only other thing as well. Just keep in mind there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS. Nothing you should have to concern yourself with though. It's more so like engaging in war or criminal activity. Hopefully aren't weakened occurrences there as well.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : A heads up too, because I don't know if it would have been the same how you had it before because it was through an employer. But now that it's kind of out on your own, the premiums for income protection, they are generally tax deductible. So it can make it even more cost effective for you. If you've got a tax agent, definitely ask them about it all, how it works.
[4 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : But that's just to give you a kind of heads up, save you a bit of a penny in the future as well.
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : All right, easy done. Now. That's basically the crux of the policy, how it works. That's all making sense. Did you have any questions for me at all?
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : No, that's pretty.
[4 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. We'll go through the duty space to you because that just opens up the quoting screen. There's just be a few questions about what you do at work. So before entering any of the questions, it is important you are aware of your duty to enter all of them accurately and honestly, just As for you to do so could impact your cover at claims time and it'll obviously yes or no response. The first one's just confirming. Do you work 15 hours or more per week? Perfect. And is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment? Yes or no, That's all right. And do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle? Yep, that's all good. And are you qualified, skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role? Perfect. This one's just double checking. Do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew, Entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces? Or do you handle explosives? No, thank goodness. And do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights above 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul?
[5 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, no, yeah, yeah, no, no.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : No. Great stuff as well, thank goodness. There. Alright, that's for Judy's base. Done and dusted. We'll move through here. So be a little bit of explaining, but also you get to pick, you know, your terms of cover. The first thing. I'll just get out of the way there mate. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Yes or no, no good stuff. It'll be a good way to keep the price down as well.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no, yeah.
[6 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : It's better for your health and then the monthly benefits. So that's what we're going to determine next is the Max level that we can actually offer out to you. And we'll do that based off of your annual pre tax income. So being under self-employed, I'll just give you a heads up what we kind of classify this as. So your pre tax income, it's your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. So it's just the amount that business would otherwise cease earning in the event you are unable to work due to a disability. Now I was going to ask as well because obviously you've just gone into being self-employed. How long have you been doing that for? Oh perfect, No, no good stuff because it'll make it much easier. I'm just going to times it by 12. What have you Like gross pay earned in the month.
[6 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : I need that a month there are 16,000 + 6. Yeah, that's 16,000 with the expenses out of it.
[7 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK perfect, no good stuff as well. No 16 K. What's that? Times up by 12 Works out to be around 192,000. You're happy to pop that in as the annual income?
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. That's before tax as well.
[7 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Pardon. What was that there?
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, just confirming that was before tax as well.
[7 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, perfect. That means having a look here. So as I said, the minimum's 1000 bucks a month. Maximum you could choose would be $11,200 and then it just goes down in $100 increments. So next step is one 11,100 and then 11,000 flat. This is what you get paid out per month. So where would you like to have a look first?
[7 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Probably a bit less, probably around that 8000 a month, I suppose.
[7 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, if you don't make it cheaper for you as well, if you're not choosing the top level. So we'll leave it at about 8K there. The next thing you get to choose will be the waiting period. The way this works with us. So it's the non payment period that must be served before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. So it's not like a sort of health insurance where it's from when you start the policy, it's from when you've actually suffered, you know, let's say you know, you've broken your back or you've got a severe, I don't know, cold or something like that. It's when the doctors told you unfit to work.
[7 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, right.
[8 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Now we let you choose either 30 days or 90 days. And just to keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So as an example, if you chose a 30 day waiting period, the first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So between 30 and 90. Which did you want to have a look at first? Dirty, easy done. And lastly, the benefit.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK, 30 two I suppose.
[8 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : This is just the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone, injury or illness, and the options you get are six months, one year, two years or five years, two. We can start at 2 and look after we go through the application as well. We've got all the final figures. We can play around with the terms as well and see how it changes the price too, Right, Perfect. Well, that's everything we can choose. The next step will run you through the health and lifestyle questions. It won't take us too long, so I'll just make sure I've got your e-mail here. It was just Brad at strikecontracting.com. Yep, perfect. And in case you do get approved, we also like to have an address down so we can get it out via post. What would be your post code there, man? Eight ON. What was the town or suburb there?
[9 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, 2580 Carousa.
[9 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Taralga. Where? Here. I'm just going down. I've heard of that.
[9 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : That's for the naughty Carlton.
[9 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Whereabouts is that in New South Wales, north of Goulburn. I'm trying to point out we're based in Sydney. I know I've been somewhere close to Taralga before, but yeah, my map skills are not where they should be. Oh, got you. Yeah, not too, I guess. Not too far. And then it just to finish that off. What would be the street number and street name for you?
[9 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's in Sydney, 15 Orchard St.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : 15? Yeah. Perfect. 15 Orchard St. And that's the same as your postal address as well.
[10 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Easy done. All right, I'll load these up now. I just need to read out what's called a pre underwriting disclosure. And it's just a statement that makes you aware of your responsibility before answering the questions. So just as here and as a reminder, of course, please be aware all calls are recorded for quality and monitoring purposes.

[11 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes.
[11 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : And the first couple ones, they do touch sort of on occupation in just a SEC there, but we'll navigate that. That'll be fine. Now the first one here, this is just asking, have you been hospitalised for COVID-19 in the last 12 months or have you experienced any ongoing symptoms or complications associated with your COVID-19 infection in the last 30 days? Yes or no? Perfect. And are you a citizen or permanent resident of Australia or New Zealand? Currently residing in Australia, yes or no?

[12 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And do you expect your income to reduce in the next 12 months?
[12 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Well, actually going back to that last question, I am running my own business, but I'm subcontracting as installed data.
[12 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : OK, because we can either go, it's more so up to your, I guess disclosure if you classify yourself as more as a business owner or as a contractor.
[12 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : I'd say more as a business owner.
[13 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK. We can go under where we live, business owner and then where are we here? OK, so we're going to business. The next one just confirms. Have you been in your current business for at least 12 months? Yes or no? No, it's alright. And then that's captured there.

And have you ever been declared bankrupt or placed in receivership, involuntary liquidation, or under administration?
[13 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no.
[13 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Very good. OK, now it's just on to the straight health questions from here. The next section is just in relation to your height and weight. So in order to move forward, we'll just need to make sure we capture a confident single figure measurement for each one. Starting off first, either centimeters or feet and inches will do. What is your exact height? Or if you remember the last time you checked, what would it be? Just 6 foot 0 inches.
[14 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : 6/4 Yep.
[14 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yep perfect. And as well for weight we can use either kilos, pounds or stones. Either if you know you're exact weight or the last time you checked what would it be? 70 kilos, perfect, pop that in there.

[15 minutes][Customer] : Yep, no.
[15 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : No, very good. And up to the medical history section. This is probably the biggest section here, but it should be fairly straightforward to move through. There's a main question that I'll refer back to and just a list of different health conditions that we'll go through together. So it just asks, have you ever had symptoms of being diagnosed with or treated for or intend to seek medical advice for any of the following starting off with cancer, tumour, mole or cyst, including skin cancer, sunspots, Melanoma or leukemia?

And then any defective hearing or sight other than which is corrected by glasses or contact lenses, No great stuff. OK, As I said, biggest section out of the way, you've done very well. This next one's just confirming other than what you've already told me about. In the past three years, have you sought medical advice or treatment by a medical practitioner or specialist? Or are you awaiting results for any medical tests or investigations such as but not limited to any surgeries, X-rays, scans, blood tests, or biopsy? Yes or no? That's good. And other than what you've already told me about, are you contemplating seeking medical advice for any symptoms you are currently experiencing within the next two weeks? Yes or no?
[17 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, no.
[17 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And lastly, for this section, other than what you've already told me about, have you ever during your working career required more than two consecutive weeks off work due to illness or injury? Yes or no? Awesome stuff. OK. They're all your health questions. Done. You've done very well, Brad. We've only got 3 left. The next two, it's just a bit about family history. So this is only to the best of your knowledge. Have any of your immediate family just meaning mother, father, brother or sister, living or deceased, ever been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, Huntington's disease, or familial adenomatous polyposis? Yes or no? That's good. And to the best of your knowledge, has any of your immediate family suffered from cancer, heart condition, stroke or other hereditary disease prior to the age of 60?
[18 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[18 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yes or no, right, Awesome. All right, And the last question I've got for you today, this is just how much of A daredevil you are. It's just asking other than one off the fence, like a gift certificate or a voucher, do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fare paying passenger on a recognised airline, Motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, abseiling, scuba diving deeper than 40 metres, cave or wreck diving or any other hazardous activity? Yes or no, Perfect. They all sound fun, don't get me wrong, but it's not my cup of tea. Prefer to keep my feet planted firmly on the ground.
[19 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : No, yeah.
[19 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : That's the application done and dusted. I appreciate going through that. It's just going to open everything up for us, which is great. I'll just wait till that loads. The only other thing I just thought I'd let you know about what's included in the income protection policy so you do get a rehabilitation benefit along with a final expenses benefit. Now this may seem a little bit morbid, but it actually pays out $10,000 in the event that you pass away.
[19 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[19 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So it's an inbuilt funeral insurance we're just going to provide you whilst you've got the income protection in place as well, right, Perfect. Now going back here and beautiful, I'm sure as you can imagine being fitters and fiddle as well. The application has been approved just with one below term. So I'll say congratulations in that sense there. Very well done. It's just one exclusion that has popped up and it's just based on how you've answered the employment question. So under the self-employed pre disability income, the pre disability income for any. Claim within the 1st 12 months of you being a self-employed person will be the average monthly income generated by the relevant business or practice due to your personal work efforts or activities less your share of necessarily incurred business expenses from the time of becoming a self-employed person to the date of total disablement. So essentially what we're going how I averaged out your annual income.
[20 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[20 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : It's basically just stating the same thing for if it does come claims time, anything happens in the 1st 12 months of being self-employed, right? Perfect. Other than that though, it's all green, which is good and we can have a look here. So just as a recap, monthly benefit of 8000 waiting period, 30 days and a benefit period of two years, you're looking at a fortnightly premium of $95.63. How's that sound for starters there? Yeah, perfect.
[20 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yeah, that sounds good 'cause I could get in a bit more.
[21 minutes][Agent] : Oh, really? Oh yeah. I mean, look, if you were to probably look at like the 11,000 a month, it definitely would be up there. But I know that you've dropped it down to 8 years plus. Look, the other thing as well, that kind of goes into it just as a bit of an insight. We base everything off of age at the time of application. Smoking status goes into obviously as well. If you're a smoker, that's going to cost you an arm and a leg.
[21 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, Yep. Alright. And that works, yeah.
[21 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : But because you saw a young non-smoker and obviously went well through the application, we've ended up at under 100 bucks a fortnight, no beauty. Well, look what I was going to say to you, Brad, if you're happy with everything in terms of how we cover you. So normally like you've got full coverage, if that makes sense. Normally like if an exclusion pops up, like you know, you won't be covered for X if it's happened in the past, those sorts of things. But you've gotten a full approval, which is great to see. What we normally like to do for our customers from here to given that you've been approved, if you're happy with it all, is actually get the tailored policy documents sent out to you via e-mail tonight. That takes about an hour tops. And then via post takes about 2:00 to 5:00 business days, but they're your tailored documents, just specific for you only and they can also have you covered as of today moving forward. It doesn't mean that you'll have to pay for anything upfront. We do allow our customers to choose their first payment day. So you can line it up in the future, whether it be, you know, a week or two or even 3 weeks in advance, we can work around that. And then from whatever day you have chosen, you then get an even further 30 days as a cooling off. Just to make sure that it's the right thing for you there as well.
[22 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, alright.
[22 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Well, I'll get everything loaded up in the background. It won't take us too much longer today. The only thing I just want to make you aware of is how the premiums are going to work sort of long term. Now the premiums, they asked it meaning that they will generally increase each year as you age. And as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy next year, the premium is actually going to stay at $95.63.
[22 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Right. Yep.
[22 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So it won't change based off your age next year, given that you're quite young, just as a bit of a kind of insight as well. It doesn't really change all that much. And in some cases it can actually go down. And then obviously we'll go back up as time goes on. But we send out a notice to you about 30 days before the policy anniversary. So you do get a heads up before it actually changes. That way if you want to discuss it with us, you've got plenty of time to do so as well.
[23 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[23 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Alright, perfect. And just also, if you do become curious, you'll be able to find more information about our premium structure on our website. Now that's everything there. The only other thing I'll check off, mate, your best contact number was the mobile that you're speaking on now ending in 423.
[23 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yep. Yeah.
[23 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, easy done. That's everything there. All right. Now just to let you know. So the final steps that we go through, if you're happy with it all, we'll jump into the calendar. As I said, you get to pick the first payment date yourself. You can choose up to 30 days away or whatever is easiest for you. We then just note down a preferred method of payment, whether it's a BSN account number or a card, and I'll just read you out a final declaration which sums everything up a little bit more formally.
[23 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[23 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Once you accept that, you're then covered from there on out, right? Perfect. So in the next coming days or weeks, I'm happy to work around whatever's easier for you.
[24 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Oh, we can start it next week.
[24 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : When did you want to start the first payment date for this next week? Is there any day? Just because I can't choose a day myself? What works best for you?

[30 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no.
[30 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Alright, easy done. We'll look. I'll pop that in place for you now. So you're covered. And with the e-mail, I think I mentioned, so an hour or so for the e-mail and two to five business days for the post. So hopefully by the end of the week you have the documents that way, have a read through, make sure everything's up to scratch, make sure all the details are correct as well, which I imagine they should be. The other thing too, for the final expenses benefit there, that kind of funeral policy I mentioned, you'll be able to nominate a beneficiary or beneficiaries that can claim that.
