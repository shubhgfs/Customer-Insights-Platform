[6 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't smoke employed.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Employed. OK, so to help determine how much cover that we can actually offer you, I'll provide you with the definition of pre tax income. So being employed, your pre tax income is a total annual remuneration that's paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses, but excluding your super contributions. So what is your annual pre tax income 100,000 So that was a yes.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : I think it's 100, yes.
[7 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, now based on your duties and income, you can select the monthly benefit amount from $1000 up to a maximum of 5833. So what amount do you think you W would be enough for you to have in place in the event you were unable to work for a period of time? 4000 yeah, sorry. And umm, the other thing umm, that you do have the option to select different waiting periods and benefit periods depending on your circumstances. So first of all, the waiting period, this is uh, this is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Say just 4000, OK.
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind though, that the income benefit is paid monthly in a raise. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. So which waiting period would you like me to select here for you?
[8 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK. So you mean to say say it again, sorry. It's just yeah. OK. So if I this period of 30 days, right, OK. If I pick choose the 30 days waiting period I have to pay the premium, you know the monthly for after 60. Is that what you mean?
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : OK, so uh huh, yeah, no, no. So the 30 days waiting period, this is the this is the amount, this is the waiting period.
[8 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : 4000, is it the 4000? Yeah. OK.
[8 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : This is this is the this is the you know so so if you were to become injured or you were to have an actual sickness, OK, that that is the waiting period that you will not receive any payment before BEF before you will restart receive before you would be eligible to start receiving any payment 30 days. Yes, that's right.
[9 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : So that's the 30, it's just 30 days, correct?
[9 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So then if you were if you were off for more than 30 days, then from that. On is when you will start to receive your actual payment.
[9 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Ah, OK. Yeah, no worries. Yeah, I understand.
[9 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : So you can choose a 30 day. So bear in mind that this is not really for you know, the times when you're just off just with a a a flu, for example, this TH this thi this is this is there to provide you that that that that coverage in the event you know that you were off work due to a disabling sickness or or or a like or a or an injury. OK.
[10 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK, so it doesn't mean like if I can't work and like for example, it's it requires major. Is that it? It requires the disease is major for me to be able to for example.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, yes, so, so for example, like, you know, let's say you were to like, you know, break like let's say your arm, leg and you were off work for let's say 3, three months. You weren't, you weren't able to go back to work, you know, let's say you had to have a surgery. So that that chart, that initial 30 days, if you decide to choose 30 days, that 30 days will be your, the 30 days would be the the non payment period and then you would receive if you're off work for for three months, the 1st 30 days would be your non payment period and then you would receive the payment for the following two months that you're off.
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, I got I got it. So for three months, for example, I can't work. So we the first month I can't get it The the the Yeah.
[11 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : That's right, there would be a 30 day waiting period. That's right.
[11 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : And then yeah.

But I, I can give you a quote on on on 30 days and with the benefit. This is the MA maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So you've got the option there to choose between six months, one year, two years or five years. What which benefit. Would you like me to select here?
[12 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : It's hard.
[12 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So this is like, you know, if you were going to be off, off work, this is the amount of time we're gonna pay that that actual benefit amount to you for anyone particular injury or or illness.

Now what I can do for you is I can actually get you immediately covered over the phone today. What that'll mean is all your policy documents will be posted out to you. You're not required to make any payments today, Marisel. We can go through the actual calendar together and you can select your first fortnightly payment anytime in the next 30 days. We can coincide that with any payday that way. That'll give you the time to read over the actual documents, make sure it's all suitable.
[27 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[27 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : You're not locked into any contracts at all. If for whatever reason you're decide it's not suitable or you change your mind, you can just simply give us a call. But the policy does also provide you with a 30 day cooling off. Which does start from that first fortnightly payment that you select. So if you do decide this policy is not suitable for you and cancel within the 30 days, then you will receive a full refund of your premium unless the claim has been made. So when you would you be happy for that first fortnightly payment to be deducted? Was there a payday that you'd like me to coincide that with?
