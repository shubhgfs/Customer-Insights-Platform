Pay for any other bills, you know, keeping food in the cupboard, utilities or any other of your Li living expenses there while you are off work and suffering that loss of income. This cover, it's very easy to apply for there saga.
[4 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : We just ask you some health and lifestyle questions over the phone to see if you are approved and if so, on what terms we can offer. And once the cover is in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[4 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : And just keep in mind that there are some exclusions that applies out on the PBS there as well.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Can you explain a little bit more about the excluding exclusion?
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Thanks please.
[5 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : So we have a couple of exclusions that are applied to our policy. So let me just bring these up. So these are things that would not be covered. So let me just bring this up for you, just so I read this word for word for you. How's your day been today there, Saka?
[5 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : That's good. Thanks.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : That's good.
[5 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Once our client goes to bed, so I'm having time to wake him up as well in the afternoon.

[5 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : So it's all quiet now, yeah.
[5 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. I wish I could have a nap during the day. Stuck at work unfortunately. Alright so the things that are not covered, what events are not covered under this policy?
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[5 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : There will be no DIS, No benefit is payable if you have disability or death is a result of an intentional self-inflicted act is a, is a result of attempted suicide, is a result of, uh, war, whether declared or not declared or war like activities or taking part in riot or civil commotion or engaging in any criminal activities or legal acts. So hopefully none of those are concern for you there anyway. Uh, but those are the things that are excluded on the policy, OK.
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK. So yeah, that's very understandable. So yeah.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : As well as umm, yeah, exactly right, as well as normal pregnancy, but that's obviously more so for females rather than yourself there aside all right. But outside of that, you know, outside of those exclusions, it doesn't matter what type of sickness, what type of injury occurs as long as you're unable to work and that sickness or injury has caused you to suffer a loss of income, you'll be eligible to make a CLA. Well, to apply to put a claim through. OK, I just have one question in terms of, uh, in terms of the premiums for the income protection. So the cost of the cover, the premiums are generally tax deductible, which can make it even more cost effective for yourself during the long term as well. So, umm, I saw that. Do you do your own tax return or do you have a tax agent or an accountant that does it for you? It's yeah, perfect. Yeah, no, I use the same as well. Most of the stuff's already done for you when you, when you use the tax umm, and then so the way, the way that works with us here Saga is each financial year we will send you a certificate of currency which will outline the details you need to be able to actually commit the income protection through your tax and receive that umm, that tax adaptability around the premium there as well. So what I'll do here now is I'll start to load up some pricing in terms of the cover. Do you have any questions for me so far about what I've covered? Oh, very good question.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : OK uh yes, I normally go to E techs sometimes and uh E techs the easiest one on OK yes uh, how long do I have to be in before you entitled to make a claim like when I get in and I will get into next week. So is that cooling? Obviously, yeah.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yep, very good question there Saga, very good question. So with us here, we actually get you covered over the phone. So if it sounds all suitable for yourself today, we we can start covering you straight away. And then that means that if anything happens even you know tomorrow, the day after you're covered as normal in the from the day that you make a claim. I will explain the waiting period, but you are eligible to make a claim as soon as the policy has started. OK.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK.
[8 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So first of all, I just need to ask you some questions regarding your duties at work here. So I'll just bring these up here now and I'll start to load up some pricing for you. Asaga. Just before answering any of our questions, it is important that you understand that you're aware of your duty to answer all of our questions. Sorry, it is important that you're aware of your duty to answer all of our questions accidentally and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your cover at claims time There but a saga. Do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[9 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : How many 16 hours did you say? 16?
[9 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : 1515 Do you work more than 15 hours or more per week?
[9 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yes.
[9 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Yes. How many hours are you doing these days? There we go.
[9 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Idle for six hours in the morning, times by 7. Oh, sorry. Six, six days a week? Yeah. 36.
[9 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Oh well, seven days a week, so at least you get one day after yourself there, but no basically full time hours for yourself there. And is your role of an administrative manager of professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment, yes or no?
[10 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yes. Indoors.
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, thank you. And are you required to perform any physical duties, yes or no?
[10 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[10 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : And do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle, Yes or no? Yeah. So in terms of driving a vehicle, just to let you know there is saga when traveling to and from work, we do not consider that to be driving a vehicle for the purpose of work. But do you UU maybe use your vehicle to take your clients to like appointments and things like that? OK, So it will answer yes, you've answered that correctly. And are you qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role? Yes, on that.
[10 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, I do, Yes.
[11 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : And do you work in any of the following fields, aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, army, armed forces, or do you handle explosives? Yes or no? Lovely. That would be quite concerning if you're handling explosives in your occupation. And so I've got a last question. Do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights above 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul?
[11 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Nope, No, Nope.
[11 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And just making status there. Have you had a cigarettes in the last 12 months?
[11 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Nope.
[11 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Lovely. So Saga, we'll start to look into the terms of the cover that you can apply for. I just need to confirm your current employment status. Are you currently EM employed or self-employed?
[12 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Employed.
[12 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Unemployed. So we just need to note down thank you for that. And to help determine how much cover we can offer you, I'll provide you with a definition of pre tax income. So pre tax income is the total annual remuneration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses, excluding super contributions. So, so with that in mind, what is your annual income before tax? OK. OK. That's what it was in your last financial year.
[12 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : I'm not sure about before tax, but the total last last year I think I had about $105,000 annually.
[12 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no worries. So, uh, did you want me to just note that down, uh, as your annual income there for the time being, for yourself for Saga?
[12 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, please.
[13 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK. If you do feel as if your annual income, you know, changes or maybe it's incorrect in the future and you wanted to apply for a higher level of cover, Uh, you can definitely do that. Uh, you just give us a call and apply, uh, for a new policy with your new terms. Just keep in mind that the application age is 59.
[13 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[13 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : So in terms of coverage here, Saga, you can apply anywhere from $1000 a month up to $6125.00 per month. So this is the amount that would actually be paid to you if you were unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffered a loss of income. So how much per month would you like me to select $6000?
[13 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : 36000 that's every fortnightly yes.
[14 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Yep OK and then the saga you have the option of a waiting period. So yo your policy does start straight away for you.
[14 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Mm Hmm.
[14 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : However any time you gotta make a claim there is a waiting period. The waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can either choose 30 days or 90 days depending on your circumstances. Then just please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. This means that if you do choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. Which waiting period would you like me to select? 30 or 90 days?
[14 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Oh, I'll call 430.
[14 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yep. You then also have the benefit yes, sorry, a saga.
[14 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : So if you yes, so 30, then you apply, you get another 30 to get the claim clear. Is that right? Is that correct? Mm hmm.
[14 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Did you have a question E exactly right there a saga. So let's say for example, we, we already had this policy set up for you and something happened today where you where you've been injured, you've suffered a loss of income and say you are eligible from a CL for a claim. Today will start the 30 day waiting period. So we'll wait 30 days just to make sure that injury is still there, as you know is still putting you out of work.
[15 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[15 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : And then after the 30 days you will be eligible to start receiving a payment. However, just keep in mind that we actually pay at the end of the month for the month before. So before you receive your first payment will be around 60 days after your first eligible claim. So after that first injury occurred.
[15 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[15 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Does that make sense?
[15 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : So one, yes, it makes sense. One more question please.
[15 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm, Yep, good question. Uh, so no, because a saga with, with the income protection, the, the terms of it is you're unable to work.
[15 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : If I get injured but I am still liable to work like like do this, is that cover or not unable?
[16 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : That's that's the first part.
[16 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[16 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : So and you suffered a loss of income. Those are the two main points that so it's either due to a disabling sickness or injury. Umm, you are unable to work and you suffer the loss of income.
[16 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Oh okey dokey. Yep. Mm hmm.
[16 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So, you know, that may give you the Peace of Mind that, you know, you're able to take the extra time to recover depending on your situation, you know, fall back on to that income protection so you're not forced to return back to work on my duties. You can maybe take the extra time to, uh, you know, heal up properly and return back to work when you're fully here.
[16 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[16 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : You then also have the benefit. Here Saga as a term of your policy, the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So you can choose either six months, you can choose one year, you can choose two years or five years. Which benefit. Would you like me to select? Absolutely. MM, Hmm.
[17 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : I can you repeat that question again please, because I don't know have to understand that.
[17 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : What we're looking into here now is the benefit. So the benefit. Is the amount of time, is the maximum amount of time that we will pay that income benefit, that monthly income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So it's the time frame around your claim. So if you were unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffered a loss of income, did you want to select the six month waiting, uh, sorry, six month benefit. So you'll be paid for six months. Would you want to select the one year benefit. So you'll be paid for a maximum term of one year, two years or five years.
[17 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : That's a good question. It's very hard too.
[18 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : Obviously none of us are sitting here for crystal ball, right?
[18 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's correct.
[18 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : We don't know what's what's going to happen in the future, but obviously keeping your benefit. Down at six months is going to keep your premium cheap umm. So maybe depending on the nature of your job or maybe some hobbies that you have. What do you think, how I guess in terms of if you were to be injured or something was to happen, maybe around your occupation or around your hobbies, how, how severe would that likely to be? Well, you know, will put you out for will six months be enough? Will one year be enough, two years or five years?
[18 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Uh, I think I'll go for two years because when you're young, uh, you can easily recover. And, uh, when you're getting old, it's take a while for you to recover.
[18 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Absolutely, for sure.
[18 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : So yeah. Oh, OK.
[18 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : I've noticed that umm, I, I play, I, I used to play a lot of uh, rugby league myself when I was younger and used to get hit around with injuries and, you know, bounce back the next week. Now nowadays I'm like, cool, I wake up and really sore the next day and it takes a lot longer to recover.
[19 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : MMM, it's same with me.
[19 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but what?
[19 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : I used to play rugby and when you get injured one day after one training session, you tie up and you play the other surgery, come and say, Oh yeah, so but not now.
[19 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, E exactly yeah, I know it's it's completely different now. Umm and then Asaka was that uh, league that you used to play or union uh, union. You're lovely. Perfect.
[19 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : A union, OK.
[19 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : I played umm, a little bit of union for school because I, I'm more of a league player for myself, but it was umm always the league and the union season never overlapped in school. So any time that we weren't able to play league or the league team would join the union team.
[19 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's good.
[19 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Umm, but no very fun. Alright, cool. So what we can do here, Saga is at the moment we're looking into a $6000 month benefit amount, a 30 day waiting period and a two year benefit.
[20 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[19 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : What we do from this point here is we check to see if you are eligible for the cover and I'll be able to bring up some pricing for that. And then we'll see how that sounds because of course, we can adjust the terms to find something that is affordable and suitable for you there.
[20 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. OK, that sounds good.
[20 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Lovely.
[20 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Thank you.
[20 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : So the in terms of the actual coverage itself and policy there, if you feel as if this is something that may be suitable for your situation, did you have any questions?
[20 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : No, I think yeah, like me, I will be.
[20 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[20 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it will be suitable for me getting old and things like that.
[20 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Perfect.
[20 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : So yeah, you never know. You can't tell the future. Maybe something.
[20 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Ex exactly right. No, no, yeah, and I completely understand. So we'll have a look and see if you're eligible and then we can discuss pricing and make sure it's affordable and get you covered.

[33 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.
[33 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : All right, there. So thank you so much for taking your time. And after going through all this question to you with me, what's going to happen here now is, is it's going to come up with your outcome and bring up your final terms of the policy. So start to be able to look into the pricing of the cover.
[34 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK. Can I ask you one question?
[34 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[34 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Is that cover? Was that like if I want to put it into my super thing, was that involved in super or not?
[34 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Uh, no, we can't, we can't do it via super with us here at real insurance, but umm, as I mentioned before, your premiums are tax deductible there as well.
[34 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep.
[34 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So, umm, it would have to come out from a personal bank account, but we will send you out that certificate of currency where you can actually submit that through your E tax system and be able to actually, uh, see that premium as a tax deduction there. Generally speaking.
[34 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Mm. Hmm. Oh, OK.
[34 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, which can make him even more cost effective in the long term for your situation.
[34 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep. No worries.
[34 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : So it's important that we find something that is of course suitable and affordable for you. So I'll just bring up these terms then just let me know how they sound because of course we do have flexibility of adjusting these terms to find something that's appropriate. So first of all there, so I want to let you know, congratulations, your application has come back here fully approved. The answer no to all these questions. You're looking pretty healthy there. So your application has come back here fully approved. So congratulations. As I get there has been a premium adjustment due to height and weight where there was a loading applied of 100% due to BMI. That's something that's not locked in stone.
[35 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, sorry.
[35 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : If your height, if your BMI was to change or in the future, you can apply to have that reviewed and mm hmm, yeah.
[35 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Can you explain to me the BMI or something in the food?
[35 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So it's just a combination of height and weight.
[35 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[35 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Combination of height and weight goes into a a calculation which is considered to be your BMI due to the BMI being slightly elevated. There's been a loading applied. But if, if you know weight was to change in the future, maybe if you were to grow taller. Yeah, that's, that's something that's not stuck in. So you can apply to have that change if your situation changes and it's purely just a loading. So you are still fully approved for the cover. There's no exclusion or anything like that. However, it has made any change to your policy where it has reduced the maximum benefit amount to $5000 per month and A22 year benefit. Due to BMI, so if we are looking to a monthly benefit of $5000 with a waiting period of 30 days and a benefit period of two years, it works out to be $719.83 per fortnight.
[36 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Fortnite.
[36 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : How's the? Yeah, correct. So just over about $360.00 a week. How's that sound in terms of suitability or do you want me to adjust those terms for you?
[37 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Can you readjust it?
[37 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yes, Sorry. Mm hmm. Absolutely.
[37 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : If I can get something a little bit done, can you can you adjust that please so it's a better one?
[37 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely. So I got Well, let's look into let's discuss your monthly benefit amount. So keep in mind this is this insurance is designed to help cover your essential living costs. So I know that you roughly bring home around, you know, over $6000 per month yourself whilst you're working. But in terms of the, you know, the cost of your rent, the cost of your utilities, your everyday expenses there, umm, could we reduce that amount down?
[37 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that, that one sounds good. Yeah, at least maybe, yeah, three between 3:00 and 4:00.
[37 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Would you, would you be able to look at like $4000 a month, $3000 a month or like, yeah, so, yeah.
[38 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : So we'll have a look at and see if that.
[38 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : And in terms of in terms of the waiting period there, so obviously keeping it at a shorter waiting period, you're going to start receiving a benefit quicker. However, keeping in mind maybe savings or maybe others, other plans that you have in place to get you through that time, the 90 day waiting period is a cheaper premium option. Did you want me to look at a 90 day or would you want to keep that one at 30 days?
[38 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : 90 days, so many months, three months for May and then after that 90 days, she'll have to wait for another 30 days.
[38 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : About 3 months, yeah, 30 days. So it'll be about four months after the injury or illness that you would actually start receiving a benefit. It is a cheap option, but of course, it's a, it's along the way there. So it depends on maybe if you have savings, if you have maybe other plans in place that could help you during those three to four months.
[38 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Well, let's give it a call.
[39 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yep.
[39 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : 90 days will be, there's no 60 days.
[39 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[39 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, just 30 days and 90 knows.
[39 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Just 30 and 890, unfortunately, in those sixty days.
[39 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's alright. Yeah, 490, we had close.
[39 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Umm, well, OK, what I'll pull up for you here now Saga is a $3000 monthly benefit amount. We say 90 day waiting period and they reduce the benefit. Down to one year for yourself there as well.
[39 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[39 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, that would bring your premium down to, we're looking at $162.22 per fortnight, so just about $80.00 a week. Is that a little bit better?
[39 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that sounds a little bit better.
[39 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And you're happy with the protection that that level of cover provides.
[39 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please. Thank.
[39 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, cool. So we'll get that sorted for you here. Now, Saga, I'll organize to send out all the policy documentation for yourself here. Now you have the opportunity to take your time reviewing this cover. You're not required to pay for anything today. You can actually choose the date that you would like your first payment to be. That way you receive the documents in advance, sit down, read through the cover. Umm, and if you do have a change of mind that for any reason the policy has a built in, uh, 30 day pulling off. So if you decide the policy is not suitable for you and cancel within the 30 days, then you will receive a full refund of your premium unless the claim has been made there.
[40 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, sounds great.
[40 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, lovely. Let me just con read you the final couple of points here. So there is two additional benefits included for you there Saga where there is a rehabilitation benefit along with a finally expenses benefit which pays $10,000 out in the event that you were to pass away to assist with your family covering the funeral costs there. Keep in mind your premium is steps which means it will generally increase each year as you age. So as an indication if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $179.68 per fortnight. You can you can also find information about our premium structure on our website there as well.
[41 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, OK. You're talking about the year yearly. So if I take the policy before say you start it up and start next week, then it will be the yearly will be October instead of January?
[41 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Mm, hmm, Yeah, good question. Yes. So, so when we say, when we say yearly, that's referring to like your policy year. So it'll be this time next year following year of cover.
[41 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, thank you.
[41 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : OK, on your policy anniversary. So, so I'll go from this point here. We get to actually choose the date that you would like your first payment to be. So you can choose any day before the 22nd of November. When will work best for you. So like like people like to line up with like maybe a payday or maybe the day that their bills come out on. So when would be best for you?
[42 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : I think will be put on November 19.
[42 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : November 19. Perfect.
[42 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep. So every every month. Oh, and every. Yeah, every month.
[42 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Did you?
[42 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : But is that the first payment or do you want the first payment to be done quickly?
[42 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : No, no, we can do a first payment on the 19th. So that actually means we'll cover you from today. You have the Peace of Mind that if anything happens you are covered. And then just the first payment will be made on the 19th of November. Just to let you know, that's on a fortnightly basis there as August. So it'll be every 4-9 and Tuesday. Is that OK?
[42 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine.
[42 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. And do you usually pay for these type of things by a card or a BSP and account number? Perfect. Yeah. That's the worst.
[42 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : I think I'll go for PSP, so we'll be good, but sometimes I just change the parts or that won't be a problem.
[43 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yep. No, that's the worst.
[43 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[43 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : I remember I lost my car at the start of the year and I had to call up 6-7 different companies, changing my car details, changing my insurances. And it's, it's annoying. So now we'll pop down BSB. Take your time getting that there, Saga. But whenever you're ready, what's your BSB number?
