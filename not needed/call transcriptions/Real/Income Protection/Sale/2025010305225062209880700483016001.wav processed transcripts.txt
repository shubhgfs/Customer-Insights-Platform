[8 seconds][Customer] : Hey, mate, how are you?
[9 seconds][Agent] : I'm good, I'm good. I was calling to follow up on our previous discussion around income protection.
[14 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[16 seconds][Agent] : Just before we jump back into it, I'll need to let you know. Again, all our calls are recorded. Any advice I provide is general in nature and may not be suitable to your situation. I'll get you to confirm your first last name and date of birth, if that's OK.
[29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Luke Thomas, 10th of June 2002.
[32 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, thanks so much. Now, I sent that e-mail out to you with your fully approved policy documents there. How did you go reading through all of that?
[41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Yeah, it looks good. It did look good. I was just waiting to get back to work before because I'm on holidays right now.
[48 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's alright. When do you go back to work?
[54 seconds][Customer] : Like the 16th of January.
[57 seconds][Agent] : 15th of Jan OK. Umm, I don't know if I mentioned to you last time, umm, what we can do Umm, if you're happy with everything there is, still get that cover immediately started umm, and you can actually choose a day that's suitable for you to start that first payment. Umm, doesn't have to be today, umm, but at least that way, you know, you can have that coverage starting in place and we can get all your full policy documents out to you.
[1 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK. Yep.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK Umm, what I'll do is, uh, just confirm again, uh, your best e-mail is luke.thomas@gmail.com. That's right.
[1 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[1 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. I can just jump back into it again here. I'll just remind you of all the details again as well. Umm, OK OK, so it's for the monthly benefit amount of $4000, waiting period of 30 days and benefit period of one year. Umm, So just to confirm as well, umm, nothing's changed in regards to your duties at work in the last 30 days. Umm, and then you still work more than 15 hours a week.
[2 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Perfect. Alright, we'll jump back in. So that was, yeah, 4030 days one year. And the fortnightly premium was $34.83. Umm, Now included is a rehab benefit as well, along with the final expenses benefit. I'm sure you read through that as well. That pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away. So again, so did you have a day that might be suitable? We can note down as that first payment date? That way we can, yeah, get the coverage started and get all your policy documents out to you.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, maybe just when I'm when I'm back at work. Is that alright or is that too long?
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. No, no, that's all right. So what essentially what the process looks like is we nominate that first payment date, collect all your payment details so that when that that day rolls around, essentially the the payments begin. But again, the cover still starts as of today. So you don't need to get back in touch with us and get that that set up. Does that make sense?
