Umm, so to help cover any bills or living expenses, this, your salary is interrupted and we do offer income benefits. It's up to a 70% of your monthly pre taxed income from 1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. Also easy to apply for.

[2 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Umm, and also to keep in mind that there are some exclusions that applies outlined in the PDS as well. Umm, and a good thing to, to note for the premiums you pay for the income protection, they are generally tax deductibles, which can make it even more cost effective for you as well.
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[2 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : But I'll ask you a couple of the questions around your duties of work to start with and, and get you some pricing. Did you have any questions here on the cover sofa?

And would you be qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role?
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : No, no, I don't understand that question. Say that again.
[3 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so or are you qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role.
[4 minutes][Customer] : I still don't know what that means. I've received the required education and training. Yeah, you have to. You have to have done the course to do my job, basically.
[4 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Oh, just if you if you're qualified, a licence fee occupation or if you're skilled or semi skilled, which means you've received the required educational training and and the training does include Yeah, OK, all good and OK Yeah, no problems. And do you work in any of the following fields, which is aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, army, armed forces, or do you handle explosives? No.
[4 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[4 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : And do you regularly work underground or underwater, or work at heights above 10 liters, work offshore, or carry a firearm?
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Well, I work inside a hospital, so I don't think that I don't work outside higher. Is that what you mean?
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm in the building. Yeah.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Because if it seems like inside a building that that phone, umm, yeah, yeah, that's OK. And because yeah, we're only concerned if it's if you like on scaffolding like on on rooftops, anything like that. But umm, future, none of that, which is all good. And finally, have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes][Customer] : Oh, no, no, no, no.
[5 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : No, no problems. And for your occupation or employment status, would you be employed or are you self-employed?
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : I'm employed.
[5 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yep, employed. And for your pre tax income, uh, just your share of your annual income, uh, well, annual enumeration paid to you by employer before tax and excluding your salary or super contributions. And it does include your salary and regular bonuses or commissions. So would you know what your current annual pre tax income is?
[5 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Pre tax before tax is it? Yeah, it's it's about 65.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Year before tax, Yeah, no problems. Uh, pop it down. So based off that we can offer you, I can choose a monthly amount anywhere between 1000 and up to the maximum would be $3791.00 per month. Uh, was there an amount you'd like to start up?
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think maybe the maximum yous just said 3700.
[6 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Mm Hmm, Yep, we can do that. Start at the top. Umm, you also have some options on selecting different waiting periods and benefit periods, just depending on your circumstances. So for your waiting period, uh, this one's for non payment period that you must wait before the income benefits payable after the insured event. So you can choose either a 30 days or 90 days waiting period, but just keep in mind the income benefits paid monthly in a raise. So if you're choosing a 30 days waiting period, the first payment would be at 60 days after your first eligible to claim. Uh, but a 90 days waiting period does have a lower premium as well. And so would you have the preference either the 30 or 90 days waiting period? Mm, hmm. Mm hmm.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : So if I've in, I've injured myself, I've got to wait 30 days for it to come through or wait 90 days for it to go through. But it's backdated. Is it?
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So it would be paid monthly in a raise after that waiting period. Umm, So it's pretty much the date your medical practitioners confirmed you're unable to work due to a disability or injury, and that's when the waiting period would start. So either 30 days UMM from that date would be eligible to to process the first plane UMM, or 90 days umm after that diagnosis.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : What's the what's the price difference then in a in a 30 day, In a 90 day?
[7 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'll give you both umm, so I can have a look and see which one works best for you. Umm, and also you get an option for your benefit. So this one's. So it's in the event of a claim, the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit, uh, for anyone injured illness at a time. So for this, you can select either between uh, six months, one year, two years or five years. Umm, so for for that one, do you have a preference for your benefit.
[8 minutes][Customer] : I don't know. It's hard to think about that Y you don't know what Ha you don't know what's happened in the future, do you? Is it, is it like the longer the better or not?
[7 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm yeah, umm, it it does depend on your situation because the longer the benefit. The higher the premiums as well.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Umm, which I can give you an example around the middle site for two years. I can always adjust that up or down if you need to, to make changes to that one as well. Uh, but yeah, to give you an example, if you went for say a monthly benefit amount at the top, uh, $3791.00, uh, waiting period of 30 days and benefit period of two years, you'd be looking at an indication of, uh, $94.73 per fortnight for that cover. And as an example, if you kept all of it the same but just changed your waiting period to 90 days, it would drop it down to $54.57 a fortnight as an example for that one out of those two would, was either one sending it all suitable? Would you like to make any further adjustments to that one?
[8 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, it's right. If I went for the 90 day one that will still pay me the the months that I've lost. Oh, hang on, so you say in arrears?
[9 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yes it would be a month in areas after your waiting period. So umm, so no claim or no benefit will be payable within a waiting period. Umm, so would would have to wait 90 days after your diagnosis. Umm.
[9 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : So when was the 90 days then do I, do I get three months worth of money back?
[9 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Oh no. So it's umm, paid months in a raise after that waiting period. So umm, so you wouldn't be eligible to make a claim or have a payment made out within the 90 days. Umm, so would have to start after that 90 days waiting period.
[9 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : So I won't get anything that without in the 90 days?
[10 minutes][Agent] : Yeah, that's right.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : If it was umm yeah we said 90 days waiting, it would be have to be after that.
[10 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : And like, how soon do you like once once you take out the policy, how soon after can you claim?
[10 minutes 12 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm, uh, you can claim straight away, which I hope you don't need to, umm, anytime soon, of course. But even if you, as an example, take it out today, even by next week if something was to was to occur and you can apply to start a claim straight away as soon as you commit to policy.
[10 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[10 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Would you like to make any changes with that, or would you be happy to leave it at those figures for now?
[10 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : I'm just trying to think whether to do the monthly thing or the three monthly thing.
[10 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, you got you.
[10 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Can I? Can I then? Can I do then the monthly wait?
[10 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Because what you can do, Yep, yeah, can do that. So we're looking at it monthly. Give me a second. And for also, would you like to just switch the, just the waiting period to the 30 days? Yeah, no worries, we can do that. And so if you did that and kept all of it the same, so it was the $94.73 a fortnight for that one, umm, and to keep in mind it is generally tax deductible as well, which can always umm, help out with that. So would you be happy to leave it at that amount for now?
[11 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, please. Yeah.
[11 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yep, not a problem. I'll leave that there. And even if you do need to make changes to it, you can always let us know and even apply to change it to the 90 days waiting period or lower the benefit. As well, if you, if you need to make adjustments to that one as well. And I also mentioned included with the cover as standard, there's a rehabilitation benefit along with the final expenses benefit, which I hope you never need to use, But it's in the event if you were to pass away while your policy's in place, it pays out $10,000 to your chosen beneficiaries at that time. Umm, so that's included with that cover and also mention with your premiums it is stepped. So we'll generally increase each year if you age, which I'll give you a bit of an example of that one. And if you do need to, you could, you can also find information about the premium structure on our website. I just as an indication to say if you make no changes to your cover premiums for next year would be $103.54 a fortnight for next year as a projection.
[11 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. Say that again.
[12 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : What was exactly so the $103.00 and I just get the exact same sorry. So yeah $103.54 a fortnight so next year's cover as a projection Yep.

[22 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : So it's probably a what's your episodes tonight?
[22 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : I'll give you the definition, what we classify as an episode, just so I get that, uh, correct for you. Umm, So what we mean by an episode, uh, directly, it's just an event, occurrence or reoccurrence of symptoms with increased severity from normal mood and usually require either medical intervention, referral, treatment or alteration or adjustment to existing maintenance treatment. And the treatment itself can take the form of either medication and, or counseling or therapy and systemal.
[22 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : And what do you, what do you mean by episodes, though? Do you mean like on and off?
[23 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm, yeah. I'll give you, uh, three examples of, uh, that one.
[23 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Oh, no, no, it was, it was. No, no, not that.
[23 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So if, uh, for an example, if someone, uh, does have mental health symptoms that require treatment and this is an episode and if they return to the doctor several times to monitor the situation, umm, mm, hmm, yeah.
[23 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : No.
[23 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So none of that.
[23 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I was on. I was on antidepressants.
[23 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : And because we, we see on did did it require any medical treatment or umm, OK, I understand that's, that's OK because we do classify if you have things that require treatment, we do classify that as an episode. But if you, if you say, if you do return to your doctor several times to monitor the situation and also repeat prescriptions and it's still the same single episode.
[23 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So that is, yeah, obviously they do monitor you when you're on the tablet. Yeah.
[23 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : Yep, I understand. Which is all good. So you'll still classify that as the same episode. And for an example, if, umm, If however, they have a relapse or systems worsen and treatment needs to be changed or increased, and then we constitute that as a second episode, umm.
[24 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Alright then.
[24 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : But similarly, if the applicant recovers and treatment stops and the applicant is fine, but at a later date, the symptoms return and they have to go back to the doctor to seek further advice. And this would be a separate episode.
[24 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, alright, yeah.
[24 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Umm, so Oh yeah, that's really what we define as an episode directly. So for your situation, umm, would you say would either be one to two by three to 4-5 to six or seven class episodes?
[24 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Are you saying within what in my life or within a certain time?
[24 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Or just have some medical history as a whole. Mm Hmm.
[24 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : I think, I think it's got over two years. You go back and forth to get monitored.
