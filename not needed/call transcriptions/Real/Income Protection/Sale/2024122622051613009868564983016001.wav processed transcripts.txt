[5 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : What what type of test results you need actually?
[5 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Oh, it's in relation to the. So we don't know what the medical condition is or the injury, but in relation to with income protection, it's designed to cover you if you're off work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. So what we're saying is any tests, examination or laboratory results as a result of your accidental injury or illness.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, fair enough. No, nothing.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK, so, but as you said that, uh, but according to your income protection plan, definitely, uh, they'll be the terms and conditions in that. But I just said if really on my business it doesn't have a Facebook, then even if you by sending all the information documentation, how can umm some percentage like to get income protection plan Actually if they really they not they need 100% income income.
[6 minutes][Agent] : Yeah, it doesn't say pay slips as such. It just says proof of income.
[6 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Oh, oh, OK. Maybe in business account.
[6 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So I'd need a proof of income, yeah. So if there's something there that you can provide proof of your, of your income, yeah. Through your business. It doesn't say payslips as as such, because we get a lot of customers as well that they, they have a business or they're a subcontractor, a contractor where they don't get payslips as such.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Oh nice.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : They're just some sort of proof of income, yeah.
[6 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : OK, so the roughly to know the quote, if I'm looking like inter production plan for eight to 10,000 dollars, then roughly how much premium has to pay?
[7 minutes][Agent] : Yep.
[7 minutes][Customer] : Do you have any idea about that?
[7 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Well, I'll have to go through that. So I'm going to ask some questions in relation to your duties that you do at work. So Ravi, just before I begin, can I get you to confirm your full name and your date of birth please? Thank you. And are you a whole life insurance with us currently confirming, of course, your gender, you're a male as well as an Australian resident. Thank you so much for that. So just to explain the income protection, so I've mentioned it quite briefly, but our cover, it's designed to provide a monthly income benefit paid directly to you. That's if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. Now it's designed to help cover your bills and your living cost if your salary is interrupted. Now if you're off work, what, what are the key things that you're covering as well for yourself, rather like with your current living situation for employee, you're currently renting or do you have a mortgage?
[7 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Ravi Kumar Vermori 27th October 1973 Yes, yes I have like one investment property. I am getting rental income and and we already buy one property and its start construction that's my our own house. At present we are renting but my son was taking care about the rental. So we are not concerning.
[8 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : We are not considering ourselves on our name and my wife she is an IT employee and as I said from business whatever the expense is happening for car and insurance of fuel that's fine is accountability from a business account.
[8 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : So that's the that's I feel that I am not considering you taking a payment.
[8 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK. I understand. That makes sense, definitely. OK, fair enough. Well, I'll explain what we offer as well. So we offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income. That's from $1000 up to a maximum $15,000 per month. That's easy to apply. So what we do is we simply ask you some health and lifestyle questions over the phone.
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes, please.
[9 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : This is to tell us if you are approved with income protection and then if so, what terms we can also cover. And once in place, it will cover you until the PO, your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday.
[9 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[9 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Now keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the product disclosure statement. Now I'm not sure if you know this, without income protection, you can generally claim your premiums on your tax which can make it even more cost effective for you. Now with the income protection cover, I'm going to ask some questions regards to your duties that you do at work. So before answering any of our questions, it is important, sorry, it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Failing to do so could impact your coverage claims time. First question, what we ask you, do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[9 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : In a week, How many hours?
[9 minutes 59 seconds][Agent] : Do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[10 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, more than that.
[10 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. And it's your role of an administrative manager or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment.
[10 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Oh, yeah, Most of the office and Lincoln. That's it. Yeah. It's a safe place for time working.
[10 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK. So, so I'll put down a yes for that question that you're, you're majority of the time you spend your time indoors in office or clinical environment.
[10 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes, most of the time.
[10 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, no worries. And are you required to perform any physical duties?
[10 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Come again?
[10 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Are you required to perform any physical duties?
[10 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Oh, what exactly means physical duties?
[10 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : So physical duties means use of force in lifting, lowering, pushing, pulling, throwing, carrying or otherwise moving, holding or restraining or operating machinery. OK, no worries. Thank you. Do you work in any of the following fields? So we've got aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces, or do you carry a firearm or handle explosives? OK, no worries. Thank you so much for going through that duty space assessment. So the next question asks about smoking. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[10 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no, it's only, no, no, no, no, no. I'm a nonsmoker.
[11 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Well done, that's what we want to hear. So good job. Because that's going to keep the price down lower being a non-smoker. So that's really good. Now I'm understanding that you're a business owner, so yourself employed versus employed, is that correct?
[11 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[11 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, no worries. So I'm just going to read you a definition of pre tax income being self-employed. So pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before taxed directly due to your own personal assets less any business expenses and excluding super contribution. This is the amount that the business would otherwise cease earning in the event you are unable to work due to a disability. So what is your annual?
[12 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : So what exactly what does exactly mean that before you told that taxation, before taxation? Can you explain very clearly regarding that?
[12 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course. So I'll reread this definition out to you again there and I am going to ask your annual what your annual income before taxes, your personal earning from the business, your personal what you earn before, before tax. That's what we want to know. We don't want to know what what the business makes. We want to know what your annual income before taxes, if that's possible.
[12 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : I got it. I got it.
[12 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, so pretty just to read out that definition again. So pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. This is the amount that the business would otherwise seize any in the event you were unable to work due to a disability. So do you know what your annual income before tax is?
[13 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh.
[13 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : H how much? Sorry Robbie.
[13 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : You compared to like from June I started maybe roughly like 120 to 150 thousand one one 50,000.
[13 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yep, thank you.
[13 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, make it minus like 2010 to 20,000 because I'm not pretty sure, but make it 130 thousand to 150 thousand.
[13 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : I can I have to put in an exact figure. I can't put it ranges.
[13 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[13 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : If you want I can I can put down 130,000 but I can't do in betw I can't do 132.
[13 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : You can put it 1, You can put it 1030 thousand. That's fine.
[13 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : No worries. Well, based on your annual income and your duties that you do at work, you can apply for income protection from a minimum of $1000 per month all the way up to $7583 per month. So in the event that you're off work, how much would you need, umm, each month?
[14 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Oh, so based on that as my per annum which I given the figure of 130 thousand, according to that calculation I can get maximum 7500 and something what you said that is the maximum, right?
[14 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's right, $7583 per month.
[14 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's fine. I need the maximum, that's it.
[14 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. No worries. There's just two more things I'm going to get you to choose. So next one is the waiting period. So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefits payable after the insured event. So you can choose 30 days or 90 days. Now please keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be six days after your first eligible the claim. So Ravi, do you want to look at a 30 day waiting period or a 90 day waiting period?
[14 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : So with that, I think the premium will be changed, right.
[15 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : If you do nine, yeah, if you do 90 days, the premiums would be less than than the 30 days is that's right because you're having a longer waiting period.
[15 minutes][Customer] : If I just waiting for 30 days, the premium will be yeah, OK, 30 days, that is the minimum 30 days, right?
[15 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yep, minimum 30 days. Yeah, that's right.
[15 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[15 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : There's just one more thing. I'll get you to choose and I'll run through indicative pricing. And then what I'll do is we'll take you through your health and lifestyle questions today too. So the last thing I'll get you to choose is a benefit. So the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So let's say, for example, if you're off work, the choices on how long you can have cover for, you can choose to be covered for six months, one year, two years or five years. What benefit would you like me to look at for you? I know, I know. It's like it's one of those things you don't know what type of injury or illness you're going to just need.
[15 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Oh good action You you asked questions that Oh yeah, but I can't say how long it is Yeah because I I most honestly, I want to be always good and good, healthy and perfect.
[16 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course.
[16 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : We want to be on the side of best but future.
[16 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, definitely.
[16 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : I can't make that answer, maybe 5 or.
[16 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Well, what I can do for you, I can play around with the figures though. So what, what, what I'll do, I'll play around with the figures on there. What automatically starts at at two years and then I can always go up or down if we need to as well.
[16 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : So in future, once I I selected for two years later if I want to make it for five years, I can make it that OK.
[16 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : You so you can decrease it, so you can make it one year in six months, but you can't increase the benefit.
[16 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : So make it 5 years, let's see if I can decrease. I can decrease, right?
[16 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine.
[16 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's better.
[16 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Of course, I'll start with the maximum five years, So the sure, the fortnightly premiums on that one. Oh, you're paying monthly for your life insurance, so I'll work on monthly for you. So it's $341.95 per month.
[16 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yes, OK, OK.
[17 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : That's starting with five years, two years, let's have a look for you. So that's going to drop that down to $230.10 per month.
[17 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : But if you consider two years, so how much we are getting the difference of both?
[17 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : So the difference is approximately that you're looking about $110 difference. So it's $341.95 per month. That's for five years and then two years is $230.10 each month. Yeah, of course you can.
[17 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Can I get A2 quotes by e-mail so that I can once I discuss with my wife or my financial advisor, I can take a call? Which one is better?
[17 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Of course. Yeah, no worries at all. That's completely fine. What I'll also do for you is I'll take you through the health and lifestyle questions over the phone today there, Rami. So this is going to tell us the final price and also the terms and conditions of the cover. And then I'll just go through some options at the end and see what you'd like to do. Yeah, just for the sake of going through the health and lifestyle questions. What's appealed more to you at this stage, the two years or the five years?
[18 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Which you given the code for two years and five years. That's what you're asking a question.
[18 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, that's right. So what what appealed to you more personally? Did, did you want to work on the two years or the five years?
[18 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : I feel personally, 5, five years personally.
[18 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Five years, OK, Yeah, no worries at all. All right there, Robbie. There's just a couple other things I'll let you know. So I've mentioned that what you pay to us, you can generally claim it back on your tax. We're also you're entitled to our real reward bonus as well. So following your first policy anniversary date, we're going to refund $410.35 back to you. So that's 10% of your premium back. Now, I'll also just make you aware that there's two benefits included in your income protection. So there's a rehabilitation benefit alongside with the final expenses benefit, which pays $10,000 in the event that you would have passed away. That's to assist the funeral costs or any other final expenses that might arise. So if you were to pass away during the period of your income protection, hopefully that's not the case at all. Umm, but your family would be able to claim $10,000 as a final expenses benefit of the income protection.
[19 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : But that already included in my life insurance, right?
[19 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I think, I believe it's like if you've because you've, yeah, the family life insurance includes that funeral expenses benefit of $10,000 as well.
[19 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Hmm.
[19 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : So they can, oh, it's a, it doesn't have to be used for funeral costs, but if they've got any other immediate expenses that modernize at that time, they can use that money for whatever is required.
[19 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : Hmm, hmm. Alright.
[19 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Now also your premium, it is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. As an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year each month goes to $379.02. And you can also find information about our premium structure which is available on our website. Now there's just one more thing I'm going to do. I'm going to read out a small paragraph off to you.

Good news is with everything that we've gone through, you've been fully approved for the income protection cover, which is good. The premiums have stayed the same there. I'm just going to reread those 3 exclusions back for you, which they're going to be displayed in the policy terms and conditions as well. So hang on a second. It's just loading them up now. OK, So. Oh, hang on a second. No, they've changed a few things. I'm so sorry. Give me a second. I thought that trainings didn't change. Hang on. Oh, my goodness. OK, I'm just going to have a look now just to see why it's due to the type 2 diabetes. So what they've done, the maximum benefit amount and benefit. Has changed. So to $5000 is the maximum in two years. So that's due to type 2 diabetes. Now as mentioned before, I mean we can apply to have it reviewed, that's not an issue at all. So they they've also had a premium adjustment due to diabetes as well. And I'll just reread the exclusions back to you. So this one is self-employed business continuity. So the income protection benefit will be reduced by any income you receive or or are entitled to receive from any business you have an interest in subsequent to the disablement date. This adjustment will only apply with the total amount of the benefit payable plus the ongoing income exceeds 70% of your pre disability income. Now the next one was diabetes. No benefit will be payable for any disability, condition, disorder, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to or arising from diabetes. Type one or two, including any disease or disorder of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular system. And then the last one is family history of polycystic kidney disease. No benefit will be payable for any disability arising from or related to any disease or disorder related to polycystic kidney disease, including any treatment or complications thereof. What I'm to do, I'm going to give you some updated pricing there rather in terms of what we can offer you and just want to see how, how it sounds. So the maximum that we can offer now is $5000 for the monthly benefit waiting period 30 days and the benefit period two years. The monthly repayment is $200.61 each month there. How's that sound for you?
[50 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Alright, it's OK. I see. That's what the evaluation is done the.
[50 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : That's our terms and conditions, yeah.
[50 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I can't, Yeah, I can't change also, right? Even if I want more.
[50 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[50 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Is it possible if I want more I can reapply or what?
[50 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Well, I'm gonna see Cos the reason like as in take out more cover, is that what you're asking?
[50 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I'm more color, Yeah.
[50 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : If you do it elsewhere, like I'll just double check. Like if you do it elsewhere, as long as it doesn't exceed past 70% of your pre tax income, then that's fine. That's not an issue with us at all. Just with us, this is the maximum that we're able to able to provide for you. So we won't be able to take out any additional income protection cover there because the maximum of $5000 is the maximum that we're we're absolutely able to offer you. But if you decide to purchase income protection elsewhere, that's entirely up to you.
[51 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Oh, that's fine. 5000 minutes. OK, let's go ahead.
[51 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, no worries. So I'll run to some options. I mean, you can speak with the family, that's not an issue. Alternatively, what we could also do for you is get you covered on those terms and conditions. So what we do is we distribute all the policy documents via post and send out an e-mail to you so you can sit down, have a review and make sure you're comfortable with everything as well.
