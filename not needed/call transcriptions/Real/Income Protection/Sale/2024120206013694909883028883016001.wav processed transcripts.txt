[1 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : There you go. Yeah, perfect, not a problem. Then I'll let you know. It does take a couple of minutes, but I'll do this as fast as I can for you. If you have any questions just let me know, but I'm just gonna read a few things for you first. So basically here in real insurance are covered. It's designed to provide a monthly income benefit that's paid directly to you. If you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income, you can apply if you work at least 15 hours per week in paid employment. And what we do is that we offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. To apply for the cover. We do everything over the phone. We just run through two lots of questions. One's a duties based questionnaire, one's health master questionnaire to see if you're approved and if so, on what terms we can offer you the cover. Once it's in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. And keep in mind that there are some exclusions that applies outline the PDS. OK. Also keep in mind that the premiums for income protection, uh, insurance are generally tax deductible, which can make make it even more cost effective for you. So when the time comes to prepare tax return and then the financial year, uh, statement will automatically be posted that to you in July of the new financial year to provide to your tax representative as well.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : No worries.
[2 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now let's any questions you have for me first before moving on.
[2 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no, no. No. I'm what?
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Now I just need to ask you some questions regarding your duties at work. It's easy. Before asking any of our questions, it is important that you're aware of your duty chance all our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your covered claims time. First question is do you work 15 hours or more per week, yes or no?
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : And is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment?
[2 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Most of it's indoors.
[2 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, I'll leave as yes.
[2 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Then the next one, are you required to perform any physical duties?
[2 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : And do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or driver vehicle?
[3 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : No.
[3 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : And are you qualified skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role?
[3 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : I'm qualified.
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : You're qualified? Yep. So I'll leave it as yes and it's easier. Do you work in umm any of the following fields? Aviation is a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry. Air Force, Army, armed forces. What do you handle explosives and do you regularly work underground or underwater? Worker heights about 10 meters, Work offshore or carry a firearm? And have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? And are you currently employed or self-employed?
[3 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Yes, No, no, no, employed.
[3 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : And thank you for that. And to help determine how much cover we can offer you or provide you with the definition of pre tax income. So pre tax income is the total annual remunerations paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses, excluding super contributions.
[4 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : About 65 I'd say.
[4 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : So can I ask you what is your annual pre tax income Sir 65,000? Thank you. So based on your duties and your income, you can select a monthly benefit amount from $1000 up to the maximum of $3791.00. So what amount of cover would you like me to quote you on please? Again the 1000 would have been the BA, the basic and then anything higher than that would be higher. But which one would you like to look at first?
[4 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yep, just go with the basic one. I SP I suppose. Just asking to see what.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : The minimum, yeah, sure. Again, if you wanna look at any other options just I mean I can bring it up for you and look at other monthly benefit amounts for you.
[4 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Now you also have the options select different waiting periods and benefit periods on your policy. The waiting period, Sir, it's a non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. Which waiting period would you like me to sell? That's keeping in mind 30 days is a more expensive option. 90 days is a more cheaper option.
[5 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Let's just go 90.
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Thank you. Now the next one is the benefit. The benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. You can choose six months, one year, two years or five years. Keeping amount. 6 months is the cheapest option and then if you get higher, it's gonna be more expensive. So which benefit.
[5 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Six months would be fine.
[5 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : You wanna go for six months. And again, I just wanna mention that the monthly benefit amount of $1000, that's the minimum cover. So a little, a lot, that's the cheapest option. Anything higher will be more expensive. So I've gone for the, as you said it gone for the $1000 cover there. So if you get a monthly benefit amount of $1000 waiting for the 90 days in a benefit period of six months, sterile, that is a premium you'd pay of $7.61 a fortnight, OK. The policy also comes with the rehabilitation benefit along with the final expenses benefit, which pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away to assist with your funeral expenses. And the policy also gives you a cash back as well. So basically after the first policy anniversary date, we also refund you 10%, so you get back $19.80 as well. That's a cash back to you. How does that sound in terms of the pricing first, would you happy with that or do you want to change that around?
[6 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yeah, No, at the moment it seems something I can, I can show my wife and discuss.
[6 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. I'll take you through the help and ask that questions because that will then tell you if you're eligible for the cover and then we can send you out your policy documents for you. OK, just got to quickly update your details.
