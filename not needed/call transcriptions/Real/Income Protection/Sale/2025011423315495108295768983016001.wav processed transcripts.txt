[44 seconds][Agent] : Perfect, thank you. Just please our calls recorded. Uh, any advice I provide is general in nature, may not be suitable to your situation and uh, just for, uh, would it be a safe bet for me to assume that you're looking at income protection just to have that Peace of Mind if something happens, then you're unable to work.
[59 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. Yes.
[59 seconds][Agent] : You want just your bills protected and living expenses.
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[1 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK, not a problem. Have you had income protection for yourself in the past?
[1 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : No, I haven't. I haven't.
[1 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, that's fine. What I'll do then is I'll show you the different options available and we'll work together to see if we can find something within your budget. We'll then go through some health questions and a duties based questionnaire to see if we can offer you cover and on what terms. And regardless of what happens, I'll send you out some information for you to review as well.
[1 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, so just basically here in real insurance, our income protection cover, what it's designed to do is to provide a monthly income benefit that's paid directly to you if you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer loss of income. It's designed to help cover your bills and living costs if your salaries interrupted and you can apply if you like at least 15 hours per week and paid employment. OK, now we offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income from a $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000. And once it covers in place, it will cover you until your policy anniversary following your seventy 65th birthday. Sorry. OK, uh, keep in mind that there are some exclusions that applies outline in the PDS and also keep in mind that the premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible, which could make it even more cost effective for you as well. OK, umm, so I found what I've explained that. Do you have any questions at all for me Joshua?
[2 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Not really, not really, but I, I think after I go through the PDS then if there's any questions I'll reach out.
[2 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : OK, yeah, perfect. No, that's fine. We'll definitely get that sent to you as well. I'll quickly now until your duties based questions, uh, for you now and then we'll move on. That's easy. Uh, before I answer any of my questions that is important, be aware of your duty to, umm, answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your covered claims time. So first question is, do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[2 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I do.
[2 minutes 58 seconds][Agent] : A. And is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment?
[3 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Yes, it's admin indoors.
[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : No, so I'll leave it as yes then. Thank you. And next one, are you required to perform any physical duties, yes or no?
[3 minutes 13 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, no.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : And do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation as a pilot or crew, Entertainment, also entertainment industry, Air Force, Army, armed forces? Or do you carry a firearm or handle explosives? And have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[3 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : No, no.
[3 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : And are you currently employed or self-employed? Employed. Thank you, Joshua. And to help determine now how much cover we can offer you, I'll provide you with the definition of pre tax income. So just for pre tax income is the total annual remunerations paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses, excluding super contributions. So can I ask you what is your annual pre tax income?
[3 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Employed 100,000.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : How much do you make per year before tax 100,000 OK, thank you. So based of your duties, right and your income, you can select the monthly benefit amount from $1000 up to the maximum of $5833. So this is the amount that we can pay you per month, umm, if you're unable to work due to disabling sickness or injury. So just when you look at your, you know, your monthly expenses, whether it's rent or mortgage loans or debts, umm, per month, how much do you feel would be enough to support those bills? OK, perfect. So which one would you like to look at first? 3 grand or 3 1/2? Sorry, 3 1/2 so you can change this at the end. That's it. That's not a problem. I can tell you what the differences are.
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : So between 3 and 3 1/2, but 2 1/2 but 3 1/2, yeah.
[4 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Now the next option you need to select is the waiting period. So the waiting period is basically the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. You can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefits paid monthly in arrears. This means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim. So which waiting period would you like to decide for you? 30 days or 90 days?
[5 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : You said there's 30 and 60.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : 30 and 90? That's right. If you got 90, that's cheaper, but you have to basically wait 120 days to receive your first payment. For that option. If you got 30 days, you have to wait 60 days to receive your first payment.
[5 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Oh sorry, 30 and 90, 9090.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : You're going to got 90. OK, sure. But the next one is the benefit. OK. The benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. You can choose six months, one year, two years or five years. Which benefit periods you want to select there? Six months? Yeah, that'll be the cheapest option as well. Not a problem. Now what I'll do is I'll show you an indicative quote for you, uh, on the options you've selected. Then we can move on to the questions if you feel that's OK. So the monthly benefit of men you've chosen is $3500 waiting period of 90 days and the benefit period of six months fortnightly. Raymond that, uh, sorry Joshua, that comes to $10.41 per format.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Six months, a fortnight. OK.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So that $5.20 per week roughly on that level of those options you've selected there. The policy also includes for you a rehabilitation benefit along with the final expenses benefit also, which pays $10,000, uh, paid to your beneficiaries in the event that you pass away while you're insured with us. And your policy also gear comes with the cash back as well, just for us. So, uh, we call it a real reward. So following your first policy anniversary date, we will also refund you 10% of all the premiums you've paid in the first year back to your hands. So you get back $27.07 as well. OK, Umm, how's that in terms of suitability?
[7 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, it's OK.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Do you feel like that's OK or do you want to look at another option first?
[7 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : But yeah, but I'm thinking there's a few things I can I can adjust there.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Which one would you like to adjust?
[7 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : So maybe the the benefit if I can put that portal in?
[7 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'll show you the difference for you one moment. I just have to pull up a new code. So give me one moment. I'll clarify for you.
[7 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : And is that is that, is that a index every year for the CPI or is what happens OK?
[7 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I'll clarify 1 moment. So 4000 dollars, 90 days and six months, that one is per Fort uh, that would be $11.90 per Fort uh, instead.
[8 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : OK. If and if I wanna visit this down the line, is it a similar process or what happens?
[8 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Correct. Yeah, same process.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK. Yep.
[8 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Basically, you just give us a ring, we'll take you to the same exact process. Uh, I still have to go through the application questions to check if you're eligible. So it's only to do that one.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah.
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : In terms of how your premiums work, I'll clarify as well, is that your premium with this policy is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as your age.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[8 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : So the cover remains the same, the amount of cover you have in short, as an indication, yeah, with income protection that does not increase unless you call us to apply to increase your policy subject to eligibility. OK.
[8 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Oh, so the 4000 remains the same, but the premiums increased the the index, the premiums.
[8 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Due to your age, the premium is stepped, which means it will increase each year as your age. I'll give you an example.
[9 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[8 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : So as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year, it will be $12.33 per fortnight.
[9 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, OK, OK. Oh, OK.
[9 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : When you're 47, it'll be $12.89 per fortnight and so on and so forth.

[9 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : OK, Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
