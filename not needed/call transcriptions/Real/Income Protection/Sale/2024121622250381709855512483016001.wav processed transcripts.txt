[4 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yes.

[4 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I'm, yeah.

Does your work require you to handle explosives, perform aerial activities or do you work in the entertainment or sporting industry? Yes or no, thank you.

[5 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : And you mentioned you're currently employed, so the pre tax income, this is the definition for pre tax income.
[5 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : If, if you're employed, the pre tax income is the total annual remuneration paid to you by your employer before tax, including salary and regular commissions or bonuses, excluding super contributions. So, uh, when looking at how much cover you can choose for this one, we do look at your annual income before tax. So, uh, what are you paid annually before you get taxed for your income? Yeah. So like yearly, like what's your annual income before you get taxed? Mm Hmm.
[6 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Hi Marie, I forgot but I'm let's say fortnightly I'm getting hang on 9/6.
[6 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Do you know, do you know the four the amount before tax though, or after tax? Because we, we need to go off before tax.
[6 minutes 49 seconds][Customer] : So for NI fortnightly I'm getting 1950 that's after that.
[6 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : MM hmm, Yep, Yep, we need to find the full tax for this one. Yep.
[6 minutes 58 seconds][Customer] : So before taxes is 2 for 30, something like that.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So about 2430 before tax. Yep. So if we do, and that's per fortnight. So if we times up by 26, they'll come to 63,180. So does that sound about right for your annual income before tax? About 6364 thousand.
[7 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, this for tax, sorry.
[7 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So I time, yeah. So I took the 2400. Are you saying it's weekly or fortnightly for the 2430?
[7 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : 60 roughly fortnightly. Yeah, fortnightly.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep, Yep. So the $2430 before tax, I times that by 26 because there's 26 fortnights in a year.
[7 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Thank you. Yeah.
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : And then that gives me that gives me just over $63,000 for the annual income before tax. Would that be right?
[7 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Let's say 60. Yeah.
[7 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK, so we'll pop down 60,000. Yep. OK, so, uh, annually come before tax 60,000 now. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Thank you.
[8 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : No, I don't smoke.
[8 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Good to hear. And then for the quoting process, we look at the monthly benefit amount. So this is the amount that you'd be getting paid per month. If you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income, then we look at the waiting period. OK, and the benefit. As well. I'll explain to you what each one is before we check. So the monthly benefit amount you can choose on based on your duties and income, you can select from $1000 up to 3005, $100 for the monthly benefit amount. So uh, which monthly benefit amount would you like me to quote you on?
[8 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm mm hmm mm hmm 3/5.
[8 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : 3500 OK, now we'll get the waiting period. So this is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. So you can choose 30 days or 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after you were first eligible to claim. OK, so for this one, the 30 day option will be the more expensive option out of the two and the 90 day option will be the lower cost option out of the two. So would you like any out of the waiting period? Which waiting period would you like me to select for you out of 30 days and 90 days?
[9 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : 90, it's three months, right?
[9 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : 90 days is 3 months, correct?
[9 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, that, that should be fine, 9090.
[9 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yep, Yep. So we're gonna do 90. Thank you. And then there's the benefit. So the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injury or illness. So you can choose six months or one year. So which benefit. Would you like me to quote you on out of six months or one year?
[10 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : And then if it is, let's say I don't have work so I can get like six months or one year. That's that's what it is, right? Yeah, yeah.
[10 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : So the benefit period's the maximum amount of time that we will pay that monthly income benefit for anyone injury or illness.
[10 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : So if it's six months, how much is it?
[10 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, mm, hmm, let's have a look. OK, so, and just to clarify, 90 days of course is roughly 3 months because obviously sometimes a month to have less than or more than 30 days you can have 3031. But yeah, that's about 3031 days in a month on average. So yes, the waiting period of 90 days, it's a six month benefit. And a $3500 monthly benefit amount. The fortnightly premium for that would be $20.31 per fortnight, which equates to $1.45 per day. To leave that Peace of Mind to look after the mortgage if you know you were in that unfortunate situation.
[11 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Can I ask you how about one year?
[11 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, now keeping in mind the premiums one year, let's have a look. Uh, so if you're doing a $3500 monthly benefit amount with a 90 day waiting period and a one year benefit. It would cost $26.45 per fortnight. OK. So that equates to $1.89 per day? Let's have a look at the six months.
[11 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : A dollar and 89 per day and the six months, yes, a dollar, 6060, $1.45 for that.
[11 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So the six months comes to $1.45 per day and that's for $20.31 per fortnight for the six month benefit.
[12 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, maybe I'll go for the one year then.
[12 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : With a 90 day waiting period and the 3500 yeah, that's fine. So we'll go through the health of my lifestyle questions and, uh, hopefully get the ACT from you're looking for now for the monthly benefit amount of $3500 with a 90 day waiting period and a one year benefit. It's $26.45 per fortnight, which of course I said equates to $1.89 per day. Now we do refund you, umm, so you get a refund of $68.77 paid back following your first policy anniversary day.
[12 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Hang on, hang on. Can you repeat that again? Sorry. So $1.89 per day? How much is it for a fortnight?
[12 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, sure, sure, $26.45. OK. And the last thing I said was in regards to the refund. So you do get a refund of $68.77 OK, so that's $68.77.
[13 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yeah.
[13 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : So it's paid back to you following your first policy anniversary date, OK all right now in regards in regards to the premiums that you pay to income protection insurance, keep in mind the premiums for income protection are generally tax deductible, which can make it even more cost effective for you, OK, Umm, and also this includes a rehabilitation benefit and a final expenses benefit. So the rehabilitation benefit is designed to help get you back to work. So you could be making that regular income for your family. So it pays a reimbursement of up to 50% of your monthly income benefit to a maximum of $3000 to help with rehabilitation cost whilst claiming. Or we can actually reimburse up to six times your income benefit towards cost of equipment or modifications required to assist your return to work.
[14 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[14 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : And then the final expenses benefit we include pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away under the policy. So your loved ones can use that money for things like funeral costs or other final expenses as well. So it's just included with the PR, the income protection insurance, OK.
[14 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[14 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Now when it comes down to eligibility, we'll go through some health and lifestyle questions. This is, of course, how we determine if you're able to get the cover and on what terms we can offer cover. OK.
[14 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[14 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Now if you are approved and you're happy with the insurance, we can pop it in place for you very easily over the phone.
[14 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.
[14 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : And you're not required to even make a payment today. In fact, you can push back a payment as far as up to 30 days in the future and we can still start your policy same day if you are approved. OK.
[14 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[14 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Now, once it is in place, it can cover you until your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. Just keep in mind that there are some exclu exclusions that apply as outlined in the PDS. And with this policy, your premium is stepped, which means it will generally increase each year as you age. So I'll give you an example of course now, so as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, then your premium next year will be $27.75 per fortnight if you're looking at the 3500 monthly benefit amount with a 90 day waiting period and the one year benefit. OK, umm, so currently it's 2645 a fortnight.
[15 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[15 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : Following your cover would be 2775 a fortnight. Is that understood?
[15 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Next year.
[15 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yep. And of course, please be aware that all of our premium projections are indicative only and assume that you do not make any amendments you'll cover. It's just an example for you. And you can also find information about our premium structure on our website if you need to. Anyway, but enough of me talking about the all the details.
