[1 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Mm hmm, yeah, no, no worries. Fair enough. And you've had it before. So you know, or you know, a little bit of income protection, like you said, you know, an incident as unfortunately it sounds sometimes those things that kind of spark that interest. So. So it is a a monthly income benefit paid directly too.
[1 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep.
[1 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : If you're unable to work due to the savings injury and you suffer loss of income, it's not to help have your bills and living costs.

[2 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[2 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : And are there any expenses that you would prioritize covering if you were unable to work?
[2 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Just want the rent is the main one. I've got $1000 a week rent coming out, so that'd be the main thing that I'd have to make sure I got there.
[2 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, not cheap.
[2 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah. Yep.
[2 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : And there's all the other things as well, like any other bills you got to pay for insurances and even food, groceries, you know, because even when that money's paid out to you, Chris, you can use that money any way you like pretty much.

And confirming your employment status. Are you currently employed or self-employed?
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No N no, no self-employed.
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So self-employed Pre tax income is your share of annual income earning the business before tax directly. Choose your own personal efforts. That's any business expenses and excluding super contributions. This is the amount that a business would otherwise cease earning in the event you are unable to work due to a disability. What is your annual pre tax income, Russell? OK, Yeah, that's right.
[5 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : I haven't done my tax, but at the moment I sort of need about, I need about two grand a week to sort of live so and tha that's that's that's that's sort of after paying bills and stuff like that, I suppose.
[5 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's because we can have you.
[5 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Well, no, that's what it covers bills.
[5 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, we can have you. Yeah. So sorry. Yes. Mm hmm.
[5 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : That was about my personal pre tax income, I suppose would be about 90 grand.
[5 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : 90 grand.
[5 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : I'd say that'd be at a minimum.
[5 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : OK, so 90 grand annual pre tax.
[6 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that'd be at a minimum.
[6 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah. No worries. So well based on $90,000, so, so $90,000, so divide that by 12 months in a year. So that's seven and a half thousand. And also we can cover you like I said, 70% of your monthly pre tax income.
[6 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[6 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : So, so that means based on your dues and income, you can select the monthly benefit that from $1000 up to the maximum monthly benefit of $5250. So that's the range that is available. And within that range, what amount would you like me to quote on?
[6 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : What was the high range? Sorry. Up to where?
[6 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Yep, the highest is $5250.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : You can do that. OK, yeah, take your time.
[6 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : OK, I might have to help it then, because yeah, I reckon I'd probably would have earned more than that, but I'm just sort of calculating on what I would need.
[6 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, take your time. There's no rush. But if you just just double check that annual pre tax income, yeah, 'cause like I said, we can cover you up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income. So just have a real look at that again.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yep. It'd have to be if I said if I were to get 6 grand a week, that's after the Sen like the 70% payout is $6000 a week, I could, I could manage to live with that.
[7 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : OK.
[7 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : So I'm not sure what that works out to be.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So you said that with the pre tax income because we're going to go by that, but is it just do those calculations there, is it more than $90,000 a year pre tax? OK, what would it be? What would it be?
[7 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it would be, well, I've, I've been putting over 10% away.
[7 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, alright.
[7 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : So I've, I've got, I've, I've got, I've got, it'd be 150 grand I've earned in the last 12 months. I, I'm just trying to keep it down the minimum so I don't have to pay as much. I'm just trying to keep a base to what I actually need.
[7 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Oh, alright, OK, so alright, yeah yeah, no that's alright. Look, just I'll just want to read that. What we mean by pre tax income, self-employed. So it's your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly to your own personal efforts unless any business expenses and excluding super contributions. So this is the amount that the business would otherwise cease earning in the event to be unable to work due to availability.
[8 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[8 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So, so I know you just mentioned 150, so so is that your actual pre tax income, annual pre tax income?
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, it would be, yeah, it'd be over that.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK.
[8 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : But I know that I'm just off the top of my head, I know that I've earned over that in the last 12 months.
[8 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Oh, right, OK, right, right, OK, OK, sure. So from your efforts in the business, you've your annual pre tax income $150,000.
[8 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Oh OK. Yeah, no worries. So we'll just recalculate that. So now based on your duties and income, you cancel it, the monthly benefit out from $1000 up to a maximum monthly benefit out of $8750. So, so based on that, what amount would you want me to quote on?
[8 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep, We just said seven and a half, $1000 a month.
[8 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. 7500. Also the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable.
[8 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[9 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : After the short event. You can choose 30 days to 90 days. Please keep in mind the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. Many. If you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment will be 60 days after your first eligible decline. Which waiting period would you like me to select?
[9 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : I'd go with the 30 days. The sooner, sooner the better.
[9 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, thank you. Yes, yes, that's it.
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[9 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : So with 30 days, Yeah, you just wait, you just wait less of a time compared to 90 days.
[9 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[9 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : The benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefit for anyone injuries or illness. Now there are four options. There's six months, a year, two years or five years.

[9 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : I'd like to say 2 years.

[22 minutes][Agent] : Alright, thank you. That comes the out of those questions. I'll just check the outcome for you. So that's thinking I'll just run through the main points. So it's a monthly income benefit paid directly to you. If you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness injury and you suffer loss of income, there is a rehabilitation benefit included. And keep in mind that principal income protection are generally tax deductible. So great news. Congratulations Chris, you have been approved for income protection and, and due to due to BMI, there has been a premium adjustment.
[22 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[22 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Just check that for you. Yeah, so premium adjustment loading due to BMI. So we're taking all that on board.
[22 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[22 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : So, so the price for a 7 and a half $1000 monthly benefit amount, a 30 day waiting period and a two year benefit. The premium is $153.31 a fortnight. How's that all sounding to you so far Chris?
[23 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that sounds good.
[23 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yep, all good. So and I'll just about that premium objection like I said I would. So all that premium objections are indicative only and assume that you do not make any amendments to cover as an indication Chris, if you make no changes of policy, your premium next year will be $158.49 a fortnight. So just gives you a bit of an idea of how much they could go up by. A real reward is also touched. So following your first policy anniversary date, we'll refund 10% of the premiums that you paid in that time. 3 $198.60 will be your refund on the reward.
[23 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK.

You select your preferred method of payment and select a a payment date as well, so you can actually push it out to date that you prefer. We could even launch a pay date if you like. Today is Wednesday, the 8th of January, but what day would you prefer for the first payment?
[24 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Can we do monthly payments or is it fortnightly only?
[24 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Oh yes, we can do monthly. Yeah, sure. So I should have asked earlier. Fortnightly, monthly or annually. OK.
[24 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Cos Mon monthly would work better for me because sometimes I'm waiting to get paid for a job and in that fortnight I may not have any. In the next fortnight I'll have the money there.
[24 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Oh yeah, yeah, enough, fair enough. I'll make it Fortnite. Uh, not Fortnite, I'll make it monthly for you.
[24 minutes 34 seconds][Customer] : So Yep.
[24 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : But let's say for example, Chris, umm, because we've got a dedicated customer support team. So if for any reason, if there's a, uh, if there's, let's say umm, there's a payment coming up and you feel you wouldn't have enough money in the account, that's fine.
