So, uh, your application is approved with the below terms, so congratulations there, Bruce. Uh, but the below terms that do come up here are saying, uh, that the maximum benefit amount and benefit. Has been adjusted, uh, and that was due to the high blood pressure, uh, medication that started, started three months ago or less than three months ago, I should say. Umm, so the maximum amount that you can now choose is five years.
[15 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : None.
[15 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : Umm, uh, sorry is $505,000 and the maximum benefit. Is now 2 years, but we had that set at two years already, so that's all good. Uh, now the exclusions that have been added umm, so because it's in the event of the claim, uh, we will reduce you the monthly benefit amounts, sorry, benefit otherwise payable under this policy by the amount the life insured receives or is entitled to receive from existing payments made under similar income re re replacement policies. So this reduction will only apply where the total amount of the insured monthly benefit uh, and income exceeds 70% of your predisability income, and that's due to you currently having income protection cover.
[15 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Uh huh.
[15 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : OK, Now there was the high blood pressure once again, medication that started three months ago. So once again, no benefit will be payable for any disability condition, disease, disorder, treatment, com or complications related to or rising from high blood pressure or its underlying cause. And then also the back disorder with surgery.
[16 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : None.
[16 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So no benefit will be payable for any disability, condition, disease, disorder, treatment or complications related to or arising from the spine, including it's incredible discs, nerve roots, uh, or supporting muscular, sorry, nerve roots, supporting muscular or beginments. Uh, and lastly, there has been a slight premium adjustments due to the high blood pressure, uh, once again, umm, and as well for the BMI. So we'll jump into that once again there for you, Bruce. So like I said, the monthly benefit amount that you can now choose from as the maximum is $5000 with the waiting period of 30 days and the benefit period of two years. Once again, that's coming up to be a fortnightly premium of 130, $57.23. So that sounded like it was something that's still suitable for you there. Bruce.
[16 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[16 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, beautiful, perfect. Well, I can leave that there for you now. I wanted to just make sure that I am covering everything again here for you and making sure it's it's covered off in today's call here.

[17 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So, so yeah, great question. So that waiting period that we're talking about that 30 days, what that is and I'll explain it for you. So the waiting period is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. So an example that was, let's say you break your leg and you're unable to work as soon as you get you soon as your doctor tells you you are unfit to work, give us a call in and we'll start that 30 days there for you. So that way you can use that period to use any sick leave or annual leave that you might have a cured. Uh, and as well, umm, that's the time that we use to calculate all your, umm, financials and make sure that we are paying the right amounts in that sense. And then as soon as that 30 days has been up, we start then paying the benefit amount there for you.
[18 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Thanks.
[18 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : OK. The benefit. Then starts there and that's when we start calculating the two years. OK, Does that make more sense?
[18 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, make sense.
[18 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. So with that one, you can choose either 30 days or 90 days. And just please keep in mind, Bruce, that the income benefit is paid monthly in arrears. So this means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, your first payment would be 60 days after your first eligible to claim.

So I just wanted to make sure that we've got your pre tax income correct here. So I do have down the annual income before tax of $126,828.
[20 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's great.
[20 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. Now I've read that one off already. Uh, and just to explain the benefit. There, Bruce, uh, the benefit. Is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefits for anyone injury or illness. And once again with us, you can choose six months, one year or two years. And that's, that is determined based on once again, those, those live questions that you already answered. OK, no, perfect. Umm, alrighty. Well, did you have any questions there at all?
