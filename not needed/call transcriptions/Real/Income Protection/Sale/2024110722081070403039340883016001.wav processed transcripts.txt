Uh, just while I get everything arranged on my end here, I'd like to get a bit more of an insight in your situation going into this. Uh, Dustin, what's the main reason you decided now is the time to look into an income protection card, mate?
[1 minutes][Customer] : I've, I've had these before. It's more to do with this compliance for some job sites. That's all.
[1 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, OK, yeah, OK.
[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : It's not actually something I need. It's something that like as far as income protection, I don't actually need it, but they have to have it for some job sites.
[1 minutes 20 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course, of course I got you. So just need to make sure you can take that box in the contract so you can do your job.
[1 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, pretty much.
[1 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yeah no, no, very fair that and I'm happy to accommodate as best I can for that. Umm, obviously if it's something you feel you don't necessarily need, we can always look and see what pretty much the cheapest option we can provide to you is. That way we can help you tick that box and get things sorted.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[1 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, here he is. Umm, And, uh, what do you do for work at the moment? Uh, that's the way fair enough. I mean, I think it by the uh the nature of how you answer the phone. Umm yeah that's good. That's good mate. I have you've been doing that job for quite a while now.
[1 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : For sanding timber, for sanding 30 years? A while, yeah.
[2 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : That's the way mate that's good.
[2 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : A while, yes.
[2 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : That's good mate excellent And umm you're running your own business at this stage yeah that's very good. I understand that and obviously, yeah with the nature of contracts, umm yeah contracting work. I understand, yeah. There's some jobs where they just wanna make sure they take that box. So you can do you can do what you need to do.
[2 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I've heard this insurance with NRMA and stuff before. So yeah, I, I didn't realise that. I thought it was just going to be a like a quick e-mail quote. I didn't realise I had to go through a whole phone court process. So we'll just sort of expedite this a bit if we can. Just gonna be a bit busy.
[2 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : MMM Not yet yes yeah, absolutely. I'll streamline the price as much as I can for you. Umm uh, because yes, we do end up arranging over the phone anyway. So figured may as well just give you the pricing and all the options over the phone here. And it's also because, uh, the nature of the application, uh, there are a few steps we take uh, firstly just run you through a couple questions about what you do at work. It's a duty based assessment, umm, so determine what we can offer to you. Umm, then we'll arrange some figures, make sure we can provide the necessary cover. Or you mentioned you just want it for the tick to tick the box. So we can always just look at what the cheapest option is to keep it cost effective for you. And then ultimately I run you through some health and lifestyle questions over the phone just to make sure you're eligible and then we can get the cover sorted from there.
[3 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[3 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Nice and easy, uh, as we go along. I am required to, umm, explain a couple things to you just so I have tick boxes on my end. Umm, only take a couple minutes. So, uh, ultimately, uh, the income benefit, uh, so the income protection is designed to provide a monthly benefit paid to you, uh, in the event you're unable to work due to disabling sickness or injury and as a result, you suffer a loss of income. And the income benefit we offer is up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income, which can range anywhere between $1000 up to a maximum of $15,000 per month. Of course we look at $1000 a month. That is gonna be the cheapest option and umm, once the policy is in place, you'll be covered to your policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. And just keep in mind as well that there are some exclusion supplies outline the PDS and just as well the premature income protection insurance. Uh, these are generally tax deductible. OK. So hopefully that can prove the cost effective for you. Otherwise though, we'll do the dues assessment. So just the questions about what you do at works. That way we can get some options in front of us.
[4 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, sure.
[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : Were there any questions you had before you do so? All right, it is and before answering any of our questions Justin, it is important you're aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly and study to do so could impact your coverage, claims time.
[4 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : No, yes.
[4 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : These are just yes or no answer questions.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Mm, hmm.
[4 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : Umm firstly, do you work 15 hours or more per week? Yes or no?
[4 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[4 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Is your role as an administrative, managerial or professional nature? We spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment.
[4 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : No, No.
[4 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : No worries. Uh, do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle as part of your role?
[5 minutes][Customer] : Yes.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Are you qualified, skilled or semi skilled or hold the required licenses to perform your role?
[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Do you work in any of the following fields? Aviation is a part of a crew, entertainment or sporting industry. Air Force, Army, umm, forces or do you handle explosives? Uh, do you regularly work underground or underwater? Work clients about 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul. OK, and just one other question more so relating to, uh, health and work. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[5 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yes or no Good ma'am. Alright, so once again, uh, well, based on your work duties, there are no changes to the parameters that we can offer. So still anywhere between $1000 up to $15,000 a month, up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income. And umm, also just to me confirm again, are you currently employed or self-employed? You mentioned you're running your own business, you're self-employed, excellent. Uh, so on preference, uh, when I refer to pre tax income, it's your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal efforts. So that's any business, business expenses and excluding super contributions. So this is the amount the business would otherwise cease earning in the event you're unable to work during a disability. Umm, I honestly, I'm having to look at any monthly benefit amount you feel is necessary, but, uh, would you prefer to just look at the lowest just to go for the, umm, cheapest cost? Thank you guys. In that case, all I need to confirm is that your total annual income before tax is at least $17,100. Is that right?
[5 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, yes.
[6 minutes 30 seconds][Agent] : Thank you, guys. Thank you, Justin. Uh, so in that case, there are two other, uh, factors that go into income protection insurance as well. Uh, one of which is the waiting period and the other is the benefit. Uh, the waiting period is a non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable. After insured event. The two options are 30 days or 90 days, keeping in mind income benefits paid monthly in arrears. So it means if you choose a 30 day waiting period, the 1st pay will be 60 days after your first eligible to claim.
[7 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Uh, and in this case, uh, 90 days is the cheaper of the two options, whereas 30 days is more expensive.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Customer] : I just said 90 days.
[7 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK, 90 easy. And, uh, the benefit. It's the maximum amount of time we pay the income benefit for anyone injured illness. The options are six months, one year, two years or five years. The shorter the cheaper and the longer the more expensive.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[7 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : Therefore, 6 months is the shortest and cheapest option.
[7 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Six months. Yep.
[7 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : No dramas. OK, easy. So in that case, uh, uh, we'll arrange now, Justin, I'll load up the health and lifestyle questions. That way we can determine your eligibility for the income protection cover. This also determines what the cost the insurance will be.
[7 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[7 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, while I've got that up, I'll just confirm your details so that way once it's all wrapped up, uh, we'll get your documentation out to you.

The premium dates came up as a result of the health and lifestyle questions.
[17 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[17 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, umm, And so the costs with the $1000, the monthly benefit, 90 days, the waiting period, six months, the benefit. So the absolute minimum cost we can go for here.

[18 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : I'd be $9.76 per fortnight, OK Anything over the year. If you prefer an annual figure that totals to be $253.84.
[18 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : OK. So do you just can you just send that to me so I can pay it?
[18 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : Yes, Sir. Umm, uh, we actually, umm, do all the final details for you over the phone, umm, in terms of payments.
[18 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[18 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : So what it looks like is we note down the preferred method of payments. Uh, we SE uh, select the payment date that works best for you, uh, any time within the next month and I'll read you the declaration. You're covered thereafter from today. OK. Uh, and Justin, do you prefer the figure being a fortnightly monthly or annual payment?
[18 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : OK, just an annual payment, please.
[18 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, no dramas. We'll do that. All right. Just while I arrange the last steps, I'm required to let you know we have a couple of benefits included with this as well, first of which is a rehabilitation benefit as well as the final expenses benefit. The final expenses benefit pays $10,000 to your family in the event you unfortunately passed away to help with funeral costs and things of that nature and the premium, the cost in.
[19 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I, I don't need, I don't need any of this stuff.
[19 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sorry, that's all right.
[19 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : So if we can just get this one done and try and get the documents and get them over to where they need to go.
[19 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yep, here it is mate. Umm, in that case. The only other thing I'm just required to mention is regarding the premiums. Uh, they are steps, which means they'll generally increase each year as your age as indication. If you made no change the policy, the premium next year for the same parameters will be $283.33 on the year. You can also find information about our pre instructional website. So otherwise, uh, we'll note down the preferred method of payment. Start with it can be either a BSB and account number as a direct debit or we can note down a card instead. Uh, Justin, what's your preference? Correct.
[19 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, this is just for the payment, Yeah, and the payment, it's not gonna make sure that it doesn't have any kind of auto renew or anything on it.
[20 minutes 6 seconds][Agent] : OK, right. So it is designed as an auto renewal type of payments. Umm, obviously within a month before uh, the renewal, you'll receive your renewal letter, uh, letting you know what the next year's premium is and etcetera, and give you instructions. Umm, if you need to, uh, call us in regards to cancellation or adjustments, etcetera, before it comes through, umm, and also let you know the dates of which the next payment is going to be made, OK.
[20 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I don't like auto renew because it's anyway you can't just get rid of that.
[20 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Uh, no, there's no method in which I can, umm, undo that. Umm, So yeah, it would have to be required a direct debit of sorts on our ends. And obviously if it's a matter of selling, you can only hold it for a year. For example, when you see your policy renewal letter next year, just give our support team a call. Umm, you can cancel over the phone. There are no cancellation fees involved. So looking here, yes, the preferred method of payment. Justin, would you rather we note down the BSP and account number or card details? Mate, what's easier for you?
[20 minutes 59 seconds][Customer] : OK, I'll just give you card details and that way we can just do that now and then you're able to send me those documents straight away, aren't you?

[21 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah. How soon till you'll be able to e-mail them to me just cause?
[21 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Otherwise yeah so it it can sometimes in some of these cases it's instantaneous, but most of the time it's within the next hour. It is relatively quick umm otherwise Justin for security purposes while obtaining your card details, the call recording will stop and recommence after we click the details.
[21 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : OK, Yep, Yep.
[21 minutes 46 seconds][Agent] : Just make sure it's all secure on. None. Uh, so please be advised, the call recording has now resumed for quality and monitoring purposes. And just confirming for the recording, the name on the card, Justin, it was under your name, is that correct? All right. And uh, the first payments, when would you like the payments to come out for the income protection cover?
[22 minutes 31 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes, yeah. So this is an annual, just the annual payment.
[22 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : The cover will still start from today regardless of which day you select, correct?
