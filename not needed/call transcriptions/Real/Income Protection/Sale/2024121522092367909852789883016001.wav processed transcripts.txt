[25 minutes 12 seconds][Customer] : No, no, Yes.
[25 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : To the best of you knowledge, have any of your immediate family, living or deceased, ever been diagnosed with Polycystic kidney disease, Huntington's disease, or Familial Adenomatous polyposis?
[25 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : No.
[25 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : To the best of your knowledge, have any of your immediate family suffered from cancer, heart condition, stroke or other hereditary disease prior to age 60? Now other than this is the last question. So other than one off events, gift certificates or vouchers, do you engage in or intend to engage in any of the following aviation other than as a fair paying passenger on a recognized airline, Motor racing, parachuting, mountaineering, AB sailing, scuba diving deeper than 40 meters, cable wreck diving, or any other hazardous activity? I'm so sorry. It was just to be hard to hear. Was that a yes or no?
[25 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : No, no, no.
[26 minutes 17 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Thank you. OK, so I'm just letting this one for you now. OK, I'm just reviewing the terms for you. Won't be too long and congratulations. So you were fully approved for the cover, which is fantastic. Now it is approved with the below term. So there has been a premium adjustment uh, due to your current BMI. Now we'll take you through some pricing. Let me know how it's sounding for you. We're obviously starting with the highest possible cover we can offer you, so we've got plenty of room to work with, which is a good thing. So let me know how it sounds that we can always play around with the quotes. Now, based on the monthly benefit amount of $6000 with a 30 day waiting period and a five year benefit.
[27 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Hmm.
[27 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : You'd be looking at a fortnightly premium of $199.09.
[27 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 14, OK, fortnight. OK.
[27 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Now does that that's before that. Yep. Does that wouldn't sound like it would be affordable or how does that sound in comparison to your current cover?
[27 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think it is a bit over.
[27 minutes 34 seconds][Agent] : OK, do you know what your current benefit amount is? 5000?
[27 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : I think this one, it was 5000, yeah.
[27 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : OK, well let's have a look. Let's have a look. If we adjust this quote to be similar to your current one, let's look at the difference. Do you know what your current waiting period is?
[27 minutes 47 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I got 9090 days.
[27 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : 90 days and the benefit.
[27 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : Hmm.
[27 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Do you know look, let's leave it at the maximum of five years because just changing it to a $5000 benefit amount and then 90 day waiting period with that five year benefit. That reduces it down to $74.61 a fortnight.
[28 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK.
[28 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. So that's why I wanted to ask and, you know, have a look at what it is in comparison to your actual cover that you've got at the moment. How does that premium sound?
[28 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Is it going to increase every year the uranium goes up?
[28 minutes 27 seconds][Agent] : Is it something that would be more affordable or of course, so your yes. So your premium is step, which means it will generally increase each your age. Let me show you next year as an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $81.47 per fortnight. You can also find information about our premium structure on our website. Uh, but yes, so next year it's, it's looking at approximately, you know, just over a $7.00 increase people take or just under. Now, did you wanna have a look at adjusting anything else on that quote or did that when they sound a bit more suitable for you?
[29 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Umm, are you? Do I need to? I don't need to approve it now.
[29 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : No, that's OK.
[29 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, you can send me the e-mail.
[29 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine. I'm happy to give you some time to obviously have a look through it. I can definitely send out some information. We'll discuss all your options at the end. We're just going through pricing at this point. How does that price sound? Is that something that would be affordable or did you want to look at some other options?
[29 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's actually, yeah. What is the other option? That's the other option, yeah.
[29 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, like Yep, OK, we've got heaps of different ways we can work with it. What what is it that you're wanting to find out? So I'm just trying to make sure that I can get. Sorry, what was that?
[29 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : If I if I got the health insurance with you and also the yeah, the health, if I take the health insurance with you, will it make any difference?
[30 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : That's a completely DIF different policy.
[30 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : A different a different policy.
[30 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : So it won't impact this one at all. Yeah, complete with this one. So how much how how is this shouting in comparison to your current cover? Based on the same benefit amount and same waiting period?
[30 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : OK, I think it's almost the same.
[30 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : Almost the same. OK.
[30 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : I think yeah, not much difference.
[30 minutes 29 seconds][Agent] : Do you know how much you're currently paying or?
[30 minutes 32 seconds][Customer] : Umm, I'm sure it was like something 5000 something.
[30 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Did you say 5000 a year?
[30 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, 5100, yeah.
[30 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : OK, well, this one's working out to be $1939.77 a year, so nowhere near 5000 a year.
[30 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Is that all for one year?
[30 minutes 52 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's the annual premium, $1939.77.
[30 minutes 56 seconds][Customer] : So it's 5452 weeks. Uh, sorry, you said 26 weeks. Yeah, 26 weeks.
[31 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : That's right. So the fortnightly premium, Yep.
[31 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : I mean, yes, plus time, yeah.
[31 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : So the fortnightly premium is the $74.61. So you time's up by 26 now. Also with this policy, there's a couple more things actually included these shows. So with this cover, you do have a re rehabilitation benefit along with the final expenses benefit, which pays $10,000 in the event that you pass away to actually assist with funeral costs or other final expenses. We also offer a real reward. So following your first policy anniversary date, we'll actually refund you 10% of the premiums you paid in that time.
[31 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.
[31 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : So on this policy here, you'd be looking at getting $193.98 back from us after the first year. Yeah, correct. Just bear with me one moment. I'm just gonna double check, sorry, whether that is the correct price. I think there may be an issue with the system. I'm just gonna reconfirm that one moment. I won't be too long. Sorry, I'm just going to double check whether that actually is the accurate price for you. I do apologise.
[32 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : I know you know that 5000, I said. It's just not the, uh, the income protection by itself.
[32 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : That's OK. Got you.
[32 minutes 26 seconds][Customer] : Uh, just tell me a second because it was actually, umm, I had a life insurance income protection and uh, the total, you know, payment API as well.
[32 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure.
[32 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : It was all together, yeah.
[32 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : No problem. OK, no problem. Well with this one, sorry just to let you know that premium adjustment should be by hadn't been applied when we changed like the amount. So for that income benefit of $5000 with a 90 day waiting period and five year benefit. It's $106.06 a fortnight. Do you know what your like current income protection is on its own?
[33 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Just a second, I just need to check.
[33 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, good. Take your time. None.
[34 minutes 36 seconds][Customer] : Taking a bit of time to load.
[34 minutes 38 seconds][Agent] : No, you're OK. Take your time.
[34 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : I do it. Umm, $82 per week, yes.
[35 minutes][Agent] : Per week, OK, Yeah, OK, sure. So based on this quote here, it's still $106.06 a fortnight.
[35 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : What?
[35 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : So that's the fortnight.
[35 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : Not OK.
[35 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Now, one of the great things about us here at Real Insurance, umm, what? What I wanna do for you, sorry to share, is to give you an idea of a couple of other options just so you can play around with a couple of different ideas. So if you wanted to look at something that may actually work out a little cheaper, we can look at adjusting that benefit period from five years to two years. If we were to do that, I'll let you know what the difference would be and then you can decide if that's something you wanna consider.
[35 minutes 20 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, OK.
[35 minutes 36 seconds][Agent] : Umm, just bear with me, I'm just letting it up. OK, So if we were to adjust it to the two year benefit. Keeping the $5000 benefit amount 90 day waiting period, that would actually work out to be $66.02 a fortnight.
[35 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : What about if I invested other thing like the benefit amount 6000? How much?
[35 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : So to the 6000, Yeah, let's have a look. Did if did you want to look at it based on the two year benefit?
[36 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, sure. One moment. Sorry, it's just loading. OK. So with that $6000 benefit amount, with the two year benefit. Still that one would be $79.22 per fortnight.
[36 minutes 37 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[36 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : So approximately just over $39 per week, give or take.
[36 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[36 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Now, the great thing about us here, real insurance, is that we can actually organize to still get you covered over the phone today. What that would mean for you is that we'd be able to get all the proper policy documentation sent out.
