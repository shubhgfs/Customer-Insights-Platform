[3 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[2 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Alright, beautiful thank you so much for that really appreciate that so just to explain our income protection now so we've just bought this product in the market a year ago so it's a new type of income protection that we've got here So with our income protection, it is designed to provide a monthly income benefit paid directly to you if you're unable to work that it's due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. Now it's designed to help cover your bills and living costs if your salary is interrupted and you can apply if you at least 15 hours per week in paid employment. Now we offer an income benefit of up to 70% of your monthly pre tax income and that's from $1000 up to a maximum $15,000 per month. It's easy to apply.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[3 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : So what I'm simply going to do with you today is I'm going to ask you some health and lifestyle questions over the phone. This is going to tell us if you are approved and then if so, what terms we can offer cover. And once in place, it will cover you until your the policy anniversary following your 6 this birthday. Now keep in mind that there are some exclusions that apply as outlined in the product dispose statement. Now also what you paid to us, you can generally claim it back on your tax which can make it even more cost effective for you.
[4 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : Yep.
[4 minutes 7 seconds][Agent] : Alright perfect. So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to ask you some questions regards to your duties that you do at work. So before answering any of our questions it is important that you are aware of your duty to answer all our questions accurately and honestly. Failure to do so could impact your cover at claims time. So firstly, do you work 15 hours or more per week?
[4 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : A lot more than. Yeah, a lot more.
[4 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, fair enough. Thank you. And is your role of an administrative, managerial or professional nature where you spend the majority of your time indoors in an office or clinical environment?
[4 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : No, I'm outdoors.
[4 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Outdoors. No worries. Do you perform heavy physical duties, use heavy machinery or drive a vehicle?
[4 minutes 52 seconds][Customer] : Yes I do.
[4 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Are you qualified, skilled or semi skilled to hold the required licenses to perform your role?
[5 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Qualified, definitely.
[5 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : It's good stuff. And do you work in any of the following fields? So aviation as a pilot or crew, entertainment or sporting industry, Air Force, army, armed forces or G handle explosives? Do you regularly work underground or underwater, work at heights of 10 meters, work offshore, carry a firearm or drive long haul?
[5 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : No, I do not, No.
[5 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : Thank you for that, beautiful. Next question is in regards to smoking. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months?
[5 minutes 39 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[5 minutes 40 seconds][Agent] : Thanks for entering. Honestly looks something like that as well. You can apply to have it reviewed because only asking in the last 12 months as well. Yeah. Secondly, we've already uncovered that you are, umm, self-employed. So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna read you a definition of pre tax income being self-employed. So pre tax income is your share of annual income earned in the business before tax directly due to your own personal assets, less any business expenses and excluding super contributions. This is the amount that the business would otherwise face any in the event you were unable to work due to a disability.
[6 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So Stefan, what is your annual income before tax pay, please?
[6 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : Before that was at least it is better. I've always started answering this question because I work on an 8 hourly basis.
[6 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, gotcha.
[6 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : So obviously I get paid, I may get paid by the hour. So it does vary depending on work. So I mean the last financial year I'm, I don't want to say too much. I don't want to say not too, not enough.
[6 minutes 37 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah.
[6 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : But in the last financial, I think it was like 200 just on, just on or just over 200.
[6 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : OK. Yeah.
[7 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, look, I think, I think I'll go about it 19190.
[6 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : If you're confident with that for me to put down to $100,000 the last financial year, I'm happy to put that down for you, 190, Yeah, sure. I'll put down 190,000 per year now also based on your annual income and your duties that you can do that you do at work, you can apply for income protection from a minimum of $1000 per month all the way up to $11,083 per month. So I understand that you've got a family of five, umm, they and you're, you know, you wanna, you've got your business as well. You're currently covered for 5172 dollars per month. If you were off work how how much did you want to be covered for as a total or each month?
[7 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Look for each total for each month. I'd like to be at least, if I can, at least 20,000.
[7 minutes 53 seconds][Agent] : 20,000 the maximum that I can offer there. So look is 11,083 with this new policy only because we cover up to up to 70% of your monthly income. So for example, if you look at what we can offer now and then, plus what you've got currently altogether as a total you'll be covered for $16,255 per month.
[8 minutes 19 seconds][Customer] : Oh, so I could actually have two different policies and claim both? Is that what you're trying to say?
[8 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, that's, that's completely fine. We, we do go through health and lifestyle questions over the phone as well to make sure that you are approved and you're able to have both policies. We do ask a question and all in income protection, I think it's does this policy plus your existing policy exceed 70% of your monthly free tax income. I think I'll go through that those health and lifestyle questions anyway and see what the question is that it's actually going to ask.
[8 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Yes.
[8 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : But there is a question that we ask just to, umm, just to see if we're able to do to do both for you as well. So it says we can offer that 11,080.
[9 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Oh, OK, that would be that would be ideal. Like if I could be at least covered by 6 feet around, I would be that would make this a lot better than 11,000 because I mean like because obviously we pay ourselves and everything like that. So we too much live off the business. We would pay for our, you know, our other bills.
[9 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Gotcha.
[9 minutes 23 seconds][Customer] : Do you know what I mean? I mean we covered, I mean look as much it would be great, but 60 probably would be anything ideal as well.
[9 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK, Yeah, no worries. Beautiful. We'll we'll go through that process with you and see how we go. Now the next thing I'm going to get you to choose as well is the waiting period. So this is the non payment period that you must wait before the income benefit is payable after the insured event. So you can choose 30 days or 90 days. Now please keep in mind that the income benefit is paid monthly in a RE. This pays if you choose a 30 day waiting period. Your first payment would be six days after your first eligible, right? So I believe at the moment you've got a 30 day waiting period with your current cover. Do you want us to do the same?
[10 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, look, I'll do the same. Yeah, that's, that's probably a lot better. Yeah.
[10 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yep, sure. Now the last thing is the benefit. So this is the maximum amount of time that we will pay the income benefits for anyone injury or illness. So if you're off work, you've got the choices to be covered for six months, one year, two years or five years. Now Robin's advised me that you're currently covered for two years with your current policy. Did you also want to look at speaking to the same of the two years as well?
[10 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.
[10 minutes 43 seconds][Agent] : Yep, no worries at all. All right, beautiful. Well, Stephen, what I'm going to do next now is I'm going to take you through your health and lifestyle questions over the phone.

So 16,000. So I think it was 16,225. I'll just double check. So 5172 and then plus 11,083. So, so basically what it's saying will this cover plus your existing cover exceeds 70% of your pre tax income. So that's all together $16,255. Don't even know we would have to do the math. Actually we've got to do the math on that because it's with with us. So this cover plus your existing cover exceeds 70% of your pre tax income. Do you mind if I place you on a quick hold there just and I'm just going to do the math just to see, just to see if it actually exceed or if it's going to be on on par won't be a moment.

No, not for you.
[27 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : No, no. But I don't can't do it anytime soon.
[27 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : Fair enough. No worries at all. All right, beautiful. So look good news is congratulations, you have been approved with the follow term. So due to the the way we've disclosed the income protection question about existing cover, I've already read this off so offset course. So in the event of a claim that we will reduce the monthly benefit otherwise payable under this policy by the amount the life insured receives or is entitled to receive from existing payments made under similar income protection policies, this re reduction will only apply with the total amount of the insured monthly benefit and income exceeds 70% of your pay. Disability income. Now what I'm going to do, I'm going to go through some pricing and see whether this is suitable to you to apply on top or if you want me to make any adjustments. So if we look at a monthly benefit at 11,083 for this current policy waiting period at 30 days and the benefit. At two years, your fortnightly installments, it's $205.67 a fortnight there for you.
[28 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep. 300. How much is 274?
[28 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : How is it so 2? So I'll say what your CU Robin didn't tell me what your current policy, what your pre premiums are now, but I can have a look for you what you'll be paying as a total for the cover all together as a whole.
[29 minutes 10 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, I think I pay like the 90 bucks a fortnight for the one I've got now.
[29 minutes 9 seconds][Agent] : So hang on a second, yes, 9179 a fortnight currently is what I've looked at. So 9179 if you're adding this as a total altogether, so 205 Sixty 7 + 9179, it's 297 and 46 cents a fortnight altogether.
[29 minutes 21 seconds][Customer] : Yep, that's not bad.
[29 minutes 41 seconds][Agent] : That's good.
[29 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : It's pretty good.
[29 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : I'm glad to hear and also well what what I'll do I'm gonna just explain just a couple of other details that you're automatically included in your income protection. I'll explain the next steps further for you. So you're there's included in your policy is a rehabilitation benefit alongside with the final expensive benefit. This pays $10,000 to your family in the event that you were to pass away during the period of insurance that can assist with any funeral costs. Now also with you're paying it is steps which means it will generally increase each year as you age. As an indication, if you make no changes to the policy, your premium next year will be $210.77 a fortnight.
[30 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep, Yep.
[30 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : And you can also find information about our premium structure and that's available on our website too.
[30 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Beautiful.

[30 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yep, Yep.
[30 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Now it's going to be two separate direct debits. Now, your next registered payment with your bill cover is on Boxing Day, the 26th of December, because that is a public holiday.
[31 minutes][Customer] : Yep.
[30 minutes 56 seconds][Agent] : Did you want us to do the day after the 27th or would there be a date when you want to start this one?
[31 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, Look at that. That would be fine. Yeah, that'll be alright. Because yeah, we'll be away. And that, that, that that would work.
[31 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : OK, beautiful. I'll do it. So it'll be quite close, quite near. And if you want to change it in the future so that way it comes on the same day, then that's completely fine. You know, we can definitely accommodate and do that for you.
[31 minutes 17 seconds][Customer] : Yep, yes, beautiful.
[31 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : It's just it's that awkward time of you now where it is Christmas and there's a few public holidays coming up.
[31 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Everything, everything, everything. Sorry, I'm just.
[31 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : That's all right. They all good? No, you're fine. Well, I'll do that. Look, we don't keep your banking information on file because it's kept confidential. So do you want to set this up through your bank account each fortnight or a debit or a credit card there? Yes.
[31 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : Look, I've, I usually said Cos I've got, I get, I get a good direct debit out of the business account, which I don't have on me right now.
[31 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Oh, OK, Sure.
[32 minutes][Customer] : You know, I do, I have the account number too actually.
[32 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : OK. Beautiful.
[32 minutes 5 seconds][Customer] : Actually I do one of my checking and I got there. So alright, so so just to clarify, so I've got 2 policies now.
[32 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yes, that's right.
[32 minutes 14 seconds][Customer] : So I've got that incur. So it said that yours only covers for five thousand 5400 or whatever. What do you want?
[32 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yep, 5172 and this one we're this one here we're 11,083.
[32 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : OK.
[32 minutes 26 seconds][Agent] : So all together at the present time, it would be all together would be $16,255 per month for the monthly benefit amounts combining the two policies together.
[32 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : And I can, and I can claim both policies at the same time if need be.
[32 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course you can. Yeah, Yeah, certainly. Of course you can. There's no issue at all.
[32 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Or that actually, actually 16,000 is actually 'cause obviously being a business owner, I just, yeah, yeah, my, my monthly expenses usually pop out at about 16,000. That's, that's also covering our wages in on top of that expense.
[33 minutes 4 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, I understand.
[33 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : So that's why I was like $5000 then I cut it.
[33 minutes 13 seconds][Agent] : Yeah.
[33 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : That's why I could still pay my business, my my obviously my invoices and still pay ourselves. Yeah, but OK, that's and I can put out, I can take our boss planes. OK, That's actually, yeah. I really like that actually idea. It's gonna kinda change too much.
[33 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, because I think what Robin was saying with your current bill cover, it's a close book where we're not able to apply to increase that benefit. So essentially you are taking out a separate policy with a with a separate amount. But in saying that there you can apply the claim on both insurances there. So that's fine.
[33 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : I also, I've been playing bike at the same time actually. I like that.
[33 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, of course you can.
