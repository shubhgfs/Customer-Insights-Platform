Hi Irene, my name is Georgia from Real Insurance. How are you today?\\n[19 seconds][Customer] : Hello, Good. Thank you. How are you?\\n[21 seconds][Agent] : I'm good, thank you. My colleagues confirmed all your details for you is that and that's including address, phone number and e-mail as well.\\n[30 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, that's correct.\\n[31 seconds][Agent] : Thank you so much. OK. And you just wanting to ask some questions about your policy?\\n[37 seconds][Customer] : Yes, just to see where I'm up to. And now that I have turned 60, umm, what is umm, what other options do I have? I just wanna make sure that I have covered every, every possible, uh, change or whatever options there are or any changes that I need to consider just to update myself and to review what I have to have.\\n[59 seconds][Agent] : OK.\\n[1 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm.\\n[59 seconds][Agent] : Well you've got an income protection, so I can let you know what you're covered for. For that there's no real changes as at 60 that would happen or you would need to make happen to your policy to be covered for anything further. It's not that's not really have the income protection would work, but it's just to ensure that you're covered for the specific amount that you should be. So to make sure you're not over insured, are you still?\\n[1 minutes 30 seconds][Customer] : Yes, I am.\\n[1 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : So you're still working OK and let me just see here, do you know how much your monthly pre tax income is or your do you have a yearly salary?\\n[1 minutes 42 seconds][Customer] : I'm a teacher. I'm an IT. Yeah.\\n[1 minutes 45 seconds][Agent] : So do you have a yearly salary for being a teacher?\\n[1 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : So it's yeah, Yeah. What is? Yeah, I do, I do.\\n[1 minutes 55 seconds][Agent] : OK, so what's your yearly salary?\\n[1 minutes 55 seconds][Customer] : It's a it's a pre tax. It's around 120,000.\\n[2 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : OK. June 20,000. OK, let me just see here. OK, so with your benefit amount, sorry your salary, you can be covered up to $7500 but you are covered for 5131 dollars.\\n[2 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Right.\\n[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, you are able to get more cover, but of course you would need to look at changing your policy over to a newer policy in order to increase those benefits.\\n[2 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK, 1.\\n[3 minutes 5 seconds][Agent] : Now you've got a waiting period of 30 days, benefit period of five years. You are listed as a teacher on here. Not that we not that we change that anyway. If you are to change occupation, unless it lessens the risk for you, if it makes the risk higher, then we just leave it where it is. So basically your policy pays a monthly income benefit directly to you.\\n[3 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.\\n[3 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : If you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income for up to 5131 dollars, now you have a waiting period. As I said, 30 day benefit.\\n[3 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : OK.\\n[3 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : Five years and the policy provides cover until the policy anniversary following your 65th birthday.\\n[3 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : OK. So Georgia, what could be besides that? I'm guessing that, uh, I suppose at that point in time, they're never than 60. Umm, I'm looking into, I don't know, life insurance, funeral benefits and things like that. This is something that I can look into it to extend, uh, my cover beyond the age of 65. And that could come as income and protection. What can I do at this given time?\\n[4 minutes 21 seconds][Agent] : So not for the specific income protection that you hold, this policy would cancel after the, it would end after the policy anniversary following your 65th birthday. However, you do have the option to look into our funeral and our life insurance. So I can connect you with somebody who can tell you a little bit more about that.\\n[4 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : Mm hmm, mm hmm.\\n[4 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : And you don't need to make any decisions today that just would let you know of what the cover is.\\n[4 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : OK, so as it is, umm, the income protection is either the cover Co covers me only if umm, umm, I mean God forbid something goes wrong, uh, with my health or there is a terminal renewal or I cannot work anymore. Is that correct?\\n[5 minutes 8 seconds][Agent] : Yes. A disabling sickness or injury and you suffer a loss of income. So you're unable to work due to a disabling sickness injury and you suffer a loss of income.\\n[5 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : Due to sickness right because of that OK alright. Umm, yeah. I'm just, I don't know with the new year, I just want to make sure that I'm covered for as you didn't know there for any more options. If there are any more options that I even need to consider to, to make sure that I have umm umm, some sort of a stability and some sort of a uh, insurance, if that's the word in uh, more than just one area. So that's what I'm after today.\\n[5 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, Yeah, OK.\\n[5 minutes 45 seconds][Customer] : Just to review, what are my options at this given time in life for my family and for myself? Yes.\\n[5 minutes 50 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, well, you can look at our life and our funeral products. And then on the life product, I think there's an option potentially available depending on eligibility, uh, for total and permanent disability. So they can also, umm, speak to you more about that. But that's also somewhat of a built in income protection. But it's not umm, like it's, it's specific as income protection is.\\n[6 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yes, yes, abroad.\\n[6 minutes 14 seconds][Agent] : It's more broad, yeah.\\n[6 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Uh, can I ask you how much is the payment that I do umm, pay every fortnight?\\n[6 minutes 24 seconds][Agent] : So fortnightly you're paying $316.03.\\n[6 minutes 24 seconds][Customer] : Or is it OK and you do have umm, the right, the right number for me to do umm, I, I change my card, but you do have the right details. I just want to make sure that you have the right details as well.\\n[6 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Sorry, I it's I'm unable to hear you. It's just gone unorderable.\\n[6 minutes 54 seconds][Customer] : I was just wanted to make sure that it is still active because I've just debited my credit card, my Visa card.\\n[7 minutes 2 seconds][Agent] : Oh, yeah, we've got your bank account.\\n[7 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : So I'm hoping you still have the right demand. Yes. OK, alright, alright. Georgia. So if that is the case, would you please transfer me to someone else if I can get my some more information about what other options do I have at this time?\\n[7 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, yeah, sure. I can definitely do that for you.\\n[7 minutes 25 seconds][Customer] : If that's awesome? Thank you.\\n[7 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : OK. Just bear with me. I'll put you through to somebody now.

My name's Emily. I'm calling from Real Insurance, but I can give you a call to follow up on the online enquiry for the life insurance just before we continue. I need to. Sorry.\\n[13 seconds][Customer] : Sorry, Emily, like I did thinking about the Adelaide 3:00 time, is it your you got 3:00?\\n[21 seconds][Agent] : Oh, I do apologise about that. I'm not sure why it's come back to you already. I've booked that one in for you now.\\n[26 seconds][Customer] : But anyway, like in a year we can speak how long it will take.\\n[31 seconds][Agent] : It depends on like obviously how you answer our questions and things like that.\\n[34 seconds][Customer] : That's OK. You, you, you go ahead. Yeah.\\n[34 seconds][Agent] : To take you through a quote, it's OK. Well, so that I can take you through it, I need to let you know calls are recorded. Any advice to providers generally make sure they're not be suitable to your situation. And I'll get you to reconfirm your name and date of birth for me.\\n[50 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. Vivek Vishnu, Date of birth, 23rd of March 1980.\\n[56 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful.\\n[58 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.\\n[56 seconds][Agent] : And you are of course a male Australian resident, is that right?\\n[1 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.\\n[1 minutes 1 seconds][Agent] : OK, perfect. Thank you. Now I did want to ask what's actually made you interested in getting life insurance for yourself?\\n[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : It's just, you know, Yeah. I was just getting it through my own on the superannuation. Uh, but then I thought I should, uh, compare that, you know, and uh, what made me is, uh, you know, uh, the property por portfolio, you, you have the mortgage on different properties.\\n[1 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Sure.\\n[1 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : You feel like, OK, at least, you know, you should have a backup. That's it.\\n[1 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely. Have that Peace of Mind that you've still got that, you know, financial security that'll help your family with things like the mortgage if something were to happen.\\n[1 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.\\n[1 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. Now you mentioned you were looking at your super, so were you wanting to pay it through your super? Is that what you were saying through or you're wanting to compare outside of super?\\n[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Uh, actually, uh, I'm not sure like, you know, Ministry of Insurance does that, you know, paying to the Super.\\n[2 minutes][Agent] : Yes, yes. So that's why I wanted to ask because with our cover it's not something that you can't pay through like a a Superfund unless have you got a self managed Superfund or just a normal super OK.\\n[2 minutes][Customer] : But yeah, yeah, at the moment like I do have the my employer super, but like you know, I, I'm in the process of like, you know, arranging my estimates for in next three to six months.\\n[2 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem at all. So it's up to you to obviously decide what you want to have a look at because we do have a life insurance for a self managed Superfund or we have one that's done outside of a Superfund. So but it's specifically for self managed. So did you want to look at that cover or just a normal life insurance for now?\\n[2 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So just I want to ask like you know or is that going to be a difference in the premium for different ones?\\n[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So potentially there could be a difference in the premium and there could be a difference in what's actually covered under the policy as well.\\n[3 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK. So which one is gets more affordable and do you know having?\\n[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Well, I mean keep them. So I mean it, it does depend because I, I can take you through quotes for both.\\n[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Sure, sure. We can do both, yeah.\\n[3 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Obviously keep in mind though, it's up to you to decide obviously what's more financially beneficial for you because yeah, so because obviously keep in mind one, you're paying through a self managed super fund, one you're paying out of your personal bank account. So it's obviously up to you to decide what is financially suitable for you.\\n[3 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : That's right.\\n[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Now, what we can do because you obviously don't have a self managed super fund at the moment. I'll take you through our life cover and explain a bit how that one works 1st and we can have a look at a quote.\\n[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's right.\\n[3 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : If you've got any questions as we're going through it, jump in, let me know. I'll be happy to help you out.\\n[3 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Sure.\\n[3 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So with the life insurance, it is obviously designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. So that benefit can be used to help maintain their lifestyle, whether that is helping them pay off a mortgage or any loans or any other costs involved in raising a family. Now it's with this policy, there is an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount that's paid to assist, oh sorry, up to a maximum of $20,000 to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. This cover also has a terminally ill advanced payer included, and you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to actually receive the benefit amount. Now, Vivek, it is nice and simple. We just ask you some help with lifestyle questions over the phone. So there's no forms to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete. This will determine when we take you through those questions. It's gonna determine the pricing as well as the terms of the policy. But we'll start going through a bit of an indicative quote together. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Beautiful, that's really good to hear. It's definitely healthier for you and it generally works out cheaper on the insurance as well, which is always a plus. Now you can, sorry. I also need to confirm, is your current annual income $50,000 or more? No worries. And based on that you can choose an amount benefit about ranging from $100,000 up to a maximum of $2,000,000. What amount would you like me to quote you on to start with? 2 million. Beautiful. Either way, I'm happy to go through as many quotes as you need, so let me know how that maximum amount sounds. We can work our way down from there.\\n[4 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : No, yeah, 22 million, Yeah, yeah.\\n[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : But for $2,000,000 of the life cover, including that terminally or benefit and the funeral advance payment, you'd be looking at a fortnightly premium of $174.91. Now, does that sound like something that would be affordable or did you want to have a look at some other amounts?\\n[6 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, so, umm, what, uh, what about like, yeah, 1,000,000?\\n[6 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So if we looked at the 1,000,000, that's going to reduce that premium down to $87.45 a fortnight. Does that one sound maybe a little bit more suitable or did you want to look at a third option?\\n[6 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : No, no, that's umm, that's all right. So, so umm, with the 1,000,000, if you can please, umm, advise me, uh, how, Yeah. What are the next things, you know, I need to consider? Yeah.\\n[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : The next steps, yeah, yeah, sure, of course. So the next step from here needs to actually take you to the health and lifestyle questions because the final price is actually determined on the outcome of this question. So we can go through those for you now. If you're approved, then we can discuss your options, where to go from there. Wha. There's a couple of things I just wanted to also let you know. So with this policy, Vivek, you do actually have a reward. So following your first policy anniversary date, we'll refund you 10% of the premiums you've paid in that time. So on this policy here, you've been looking at getting $227.38 back from us after the first year. I also wanted to ask, have you got an up to date will in place for yourself at the moment?\\n[7 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I know. I think I, yeah, I do need to make one. Yeah.\\n[7 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Great, Yeah, no worries. The reason I ask is because we'll actually provide you with a free online legal will valued at $160.00 with the policy. So if you want to use that to organise a will for yourself, you definitely can.\\n[7 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : So you're saying a free online bill?\\n[7 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it's a free online legal will valued at $160.00, but that'll be sent through to your e-mail address. It'll come from a company called Safe Will. Now just before we go through the questions, I do need to grab your address. What's your post code? What was that?\\n[8 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : 5085 50855085 Enfield Enfield.\\n[8 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Sorry 5485 05 ye beautiful and the town or suburb you live in Perfect and your address.

You can also find information about our premium structure on our website. But the great news is, is that now that you have been fully approved for the cover, this actually allows us to get you covered over the phone today. What that would actually mean for you is that we'd get the proper policy documentation sent out. That way you can sit down, have a good read through to make sure obviously happy with everything to do with the cover, but you don't have to pay anything until the day you choose. If you end up looking through it and you change your mind for any reason, that's perfectly fine. There's no cancellation fees. You're not locked into this. I mean you actually have a 30 day cooling off. So if you cancelled within that 30 days, you get a full refund of any premiums you may have paid. Unless of course a claim has been made, but obviously touched with that's not going to be the case for a very, very long time.\\n[25 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah.\\n[26 minutes 3 seconds][Agent] : Now. I'm just going to confirm a couple more of your details. So I've got your e-mail address asthevecsimi@gmail.com, is that correct?\\n[26 minutes 15 seconds][Customer] : Yes.\\n[26 minutes 16 seconds][Agent] : Beautiful. Now one thing I also want to double check, we have got a, we've got two contact numbers here, so I've got this one. I've called 0433847430. Is that correct?\\n[26 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : Yeah.\\n[26 minutes 31 seconds][Agent] : We also seem to have a landline. It might have been from a previous conversation, but we've got 0872256444. Is that an old one? Will we get rid of it? Yeah, no worries. We'll just leave the mobile number. Is that right?\\n[26 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : No, Yeah, yeah.\\n[26 minutes 48 seconds][Agent] : Yeah. Perfect. Now, as I mentioned, even though you are covered with us from today, Vivek, you still aren't required to pay anything until the day you choose. What day would you like me to note down for the first payment day?\\n[27 minutes 2 seconds][Customer] : Umm, as you mentioned, like I got 30 days to decide.\\n[27 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : So just to let you know, just to clarify there, Vivek, that 30 days you're referring to, that's the 30 day cooling off. Is that what you mean?\\n[27 minutes 6 seconds][Customer] : So like you know, I mean we can do it from 29th day from today, yes.\\n[27 minutes 22 seconds][Agent] : Yes, Sir. Just to let you know, that actually starts from your first payment day. So I can still have your first payment day 29 days from today, obviously just depended on the calendar, but I can still have it that pushed out that far for you if you'd prefer. But the 30 day cooling off. Doesn't actually start till the first payment day. Sure.\\n[27 minutes 41 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, no, I understand. So they actually umm, I just want to ask like you know, umm, if with the real insurance and does real insurance, does any other insurances? I have umm been like the pet insurance. I've seen other either. Is it property insurance? You do.\\n[27 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : Yep, absolutely. Yeah, we do offer all of that. It's not something I can offer because I do life insurance. So I deal in like the personal insurances, but I can absolutely put you through to our general insurance. They can help you with things like home and contents, pet insurance, car, etcetera.\\n[28 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : And, uh, is there like any, uh, discount off on the multiple policies?\\n[28 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : So not from like if you do like an income. Oh, sorry. If you do like the life insurance and the umm, like car insurance and things like that because they work completely separate to us being general insurance is a completely different like type of insurance. Umm, but I can't confirm.\\n[28 minutes 43 seconds][Customer] : That's OK.\\n[28 minutes 39 seconds][Agent] : I don't know whether it's something that they offer over at general insurance if you have, if you have multiple like general policies, but it's not something that we offer with life insurance in my home, for example.\\n[28 minutes 50 seconds][Customer] : No, that's OK.\\n[29 minutes][Agent] : Mm Hmm.\\n[28 minutes 51 seconds][Customer] : So can you like, umm, send me, you know, the policy in itself that, you know, umm, as the, as the code, so that, you know, I mean, I can look into that in more detail.\\n[29 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Yep. Yep. Yep, Yep, Yep.\\n[29 minutes 3 seconds][Customer] : Uh, and uh, once like I do, umm, you may go through that, then I can confirm it, you know, over the phone or you can reschedule that, you know, or the, OR say next, next Friday, same time.\\n[29 minutes 19 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, that's fine. Look, I'm more than happy to give you some time to have a look at some information and the quote and we can give you a call back. Alternatively, by us still getting you covered from today's back, it means that we can actually send out your personalized policy documents for you to have a look through. Make sure you're happy with everything to do with your policy specifically. Like I mentioned, even though you're covered from today, you wouldn't have to pay anything until the day you choose. And if you end up looking through it all and you change your mind, there's no cancellation fees. You're not logged into this, so you're happy to be covered while you review the documents.\\n[29 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : So what exactly I need to do in that case?\\n[29 minutes 57 seconds][Agent] : So if we're covering you from today, what that basically means is that we'd note down like a preferred payment date in the future and payment method. So we'd organise that direct debit, but nothing would actually come out until the day you've selected.\\n[30 minutes 11 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah. And if there's a change of mind, I can ring back and confirm that. Is that right?\\n[30 minutes 18 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, there's no cancellation fees. You're not logged into this.\\n[30 minutes 22 seconds][Customer] : OK, yeah. And yeah, if I do cancel that for the 2 million, then, you know, we can change that if that's right.\\n[30 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : So subject to eligibility, you can apply to change the benefit amount down the track.\\n[30 minutes 38 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's fine. So, uh, what do I need to do? I need to give you the details of like, you know, I mean, or I do need to fill in, uh, the e-mail which you send it to me back or.\\n[30 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : So yeah, you can do that. Otherwise, alternatively, if we get you covered over the phone, so I can note those details down. Now the only form you'd really need to fill out would be a beneficiary form. So who that money is actually going to. But what I just want to double check first is with your with regards to the payment day. So what day did you actually want that first payment day to be?\\n[31 minutes 16 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So that could be from 10th of January.\\n[31 minutes 23 seconds][Agent] : Yes. So that's a week from today, so Friday the 10th and then it would be every fortnight on a Friday. So you're happy with that? OK, beautiful. Now it's nice and easy. We do a direct debit. Are we noting down a BSB account number or Visa or MasterCard?\\n[31 minutes 27 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, Yeah, I will just give you the BSB and account number.\\n[31 minutes 47 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, not a problem.

Thank you. Now I did want to ask what's actually made you interested in getting life insurance for yourself?\\n[1 minutes 9 seconds][Customer] : It's just, you know, Yeah. I was just getting it through my own on the superannuation. Uh, but then I thought I should, uh, compare that, you know, and uh, what made me is, uh, you know, uh, the property por portfolio, you, you have the mortgage on different properties.\\n[1 minutes 28 seconds][Agent] : Sure.\\n[1 minutes 28 seconds][Customer] : You feel like, OK, at least, you know, you should have a backup. That's it.\\n[1 minutes 32 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, absolutely. Have that Peace of Mind that you've still got that, you know, financial security that'll help your family with things like the mortgage if something were to happen.\\n[1 minutes 40 seconds][Customer] : That's correct.\\n[1 minutes 42 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, perfect. Now you mentioned you were looking at your super, so were you wanting to pay it through your super? Is that what you were saying through or you're wanting to compare outside of super?\\n[1 minutes 53 seconds][Customer] : Uh, actually, uh, I'm not sure like, you know, Ministry of Insurance does that, you know, paying to the Super.\\n[2 minutes][Agent] : Yes, yes. So that's why I wanted to ask because with our cover it's not something that you can't pay through like a a Superfund unless have you got a self managed Superfund or just a normal super OK.\\n[2 minutes][Customer] : But yeah, yeah, at the moment like I do have the my employer super, but like you know, I, I'm in the process of like, you know, arranging my estimates for in next three to six months.\\n[2 minutes 25 seconds][Agent] : OK, no problem at all. So it's up to you to obviously decide what you want to have a look at because we do have a life insurance for a self managed Superfund or we have one that's done outside of a Superfund. So but it's specifically for self managed. So did you want to look at that cover or just a normal life insurance for now?\\n[2 minutes 46 seconds][Customer] : Yeah. So just I want to ask like you know or is that going to be a difference in the premium for different ones?\\n[2 minutes 54 seconds][Agent] : So potentially there could be a difference in the premium and there could be a difference in what's actually covered under the policy as well.\\n[3 minutes 1 seconds][Customer] : OK. So which one is gets more affordable and do you know having?\\n[3 minutes 10 seconds][Agent] : Well, I mean keep them. So I mean it, it does depend because I, I can take you through quotes for both.\\n[3 minutes 18 seconds][Customer] : Sure, sure. We can do both, yeah.\\n[3 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : Obviously keep in mind though, it's up to you to decide obviously what's more financially beneficial for you because yeah, so because obviously keep in mind one, you're paying through a self managed super fund, one you're paying out of your personal bank account. So it's obviously up to you to decide what is financially suitable for you.\\n[3 minutes 33 seconds][Customer] : That's right.\\n[3 minutes 33 seconds][Agent] : Now, what we can do because you obviously don't have a self managed super fund at the moment. I'll take you through our life cover and explain a bit how that one works 1st and we can have a look at a quote.\\n[3 minutes 44 seconds][Customer] : Yeah, that's right.\\n[3 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : If you've got any questions as we're going through it, jump in, let me know. I'll be happy to help you out.\\n[3 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : Sure.\\n[3 minutes 49 seconds][Agent] : So with the life insurance, it is obviously designed to provide financial protection for your loved ones through a lump sum payment if you were to pass away. So that benefit can be used to help maintain their lifestyle, whether that is helping them pay off a mortgage or any loans or any other costs involved in raising a family. Now it's with this policy, there is an advance payment of 20% of the benefit amount that's paid to assist, oh sorry, up to a maximum of $20,000 to help with funeral costs or any other final expenses at the time. This cover also has a terminally ill advanced payer included, and you can nominate up to five beneficiaries to actually receive the benefit amount. Now, Vivek, it is nice and simple. We just ask you some help with lifestyle questions over the phone. So there's no forms to fill in medical checks or blood tests to complete. This will determine when we take you through those questions. It's gonna determine the pricing as well as the terms of the policy. But we'll start going through a bit of an indicative quote together. Have you had a cigarette in the last 12 months? Beautiful, that's really good to hear. It's definitely healthier for you and it generally works out cheaper on the insurance as well, which is always a plus. Now you can, sorry. I also need to confirm, is your current annual income $50,000 or more? No worries. And based on that you can choose an amount benefit about ranging from $100,000 up to a maximum of $2,000,000. What amount would you like me to quote you on to start with? 2 million. Beautiful. Either way, I'm happy to go through as many quotes as you need, so let me know how that maximum amount sounds. We can work our way down from there.\\n[4 minutes 57 seconds][Customer] : No, yeah, 22 million, Yeah, yeah.\\n[5 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : But for $2,000,000 of the life cover, including that terminally or benefit and the funeral advance payment, you'd be looking at a fortnightly premium of $174.91. Now, does that sound like something that would be affordable or did you want to have a look at some other amounts?\\n[6 minutes 7 seconds][Customer] : OK, so, umm, what, uh, what about like, yeah, 1,000,000?\\n[6 minutes 15 seconds][Agent] : So if we looked at the 1,000,000, that's going to reduce that premium down to $87.45 a fortnight. Does that one sound maybe a little bit more suitable or did you want to look at a third option?\\n[6 minutes 29 seconds][Customer] : No, no, that's umm, that's all right. So, so umm, with the 1,000,000, if you can please, umm, advise me, uh, how, Yeah. What are the next things, you know, I need to consider? Yeah.\\n[6 minutes 44 seconds][Agent] : The next steps, yeah, yeah, sure, of course. So the next step from here needs to actually take you to the health and lifestyle questions because the final price is actually determined on the outcome of this question. So we can go through those for you now. If you're approved, then we can discuss your options, where to go from there. Wha. There's a couple of things I just wanted to also let you know. So with this policy, Vivek, you do actually have a reward. So following your first policy anniversary date, we'll refund you 10% of the premiums you've paid in that time. So on this policy here, you've been looking at getting $227.38 back from us after the first year. I also wanted to ask, have you got an up to date will in place for yourself at the moment?\\n[7 minutes][Customer] : Yeah, yeah, I know. I think I, yeah, I do need to make one. Yeah.\\n[7 minutes 35 seconds][Agent] : Great, Yeah, no worries. The reason I ask is because we'll actually provide you with a free online legal will valued at $160.00 with the policy. So if you want to use that to organise a will for yourself, you definitely can.\\n[7 minutes 48 seconds][Customer] : So you're saying a free online bill?\\n[7 minutes 51 seconds][Agent] : Yeah, it's a free online legal will valued at $160.00, but that'll be sent through to your e-mail address. It'll come from a company called Safe Will. Now just before we go through the questions, I do need to grab your address. What's your post code? What was that?\\n[8 minutes 8 seconds][Customer] : 5085 50855085 Enfield Enfield.\\n[8 minutes 11 seconds][Agent] : Sorry 5485 05 ye beautiful and the town or suburb you live in Perfect and your address.

Is your postal address that same address? Perfect.
