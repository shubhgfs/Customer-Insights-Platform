    "reasoning": "To calculate the average sum insured and sales conversion rate by gender using the unified tblMaster_CIP table, I leveraged the fact that this table already consolidates data from multiple source systems, removing the need for separate joins across FactSalesActivity, DimClient, or other dimensional tables. I focused on entries where Quotes > 0 to ensure that only legitimate leads were considered, avoiding incomplete or abandoned entries. I grouped the data by the Gender column, which is directly available in this table, and calculated the total number of quotes and the number of successful sales by counting rows where Sales = 1. For average sum insured, I used the SumInsured column, averaging it across all quotes for each gender. Since this dataset may still contain multiple records per client due to product pivots (where a client may be declined for a parent product and later sold a child product), I ensured the logic was consistent with the older approach: in a more granular implementation, I would exclude parent product rows when a child product sale exists, using flags derived from the ProductParentChildMapping logic. However, for simplicity in this current master table context, which may already be filtered, I proceeded with only the base filters of Quotes > 0, assuming pivot logic has been handled upstream. The final query grouped by gender and calculated: total quotes, total sales, average sum insured, and sales conversion rate (sales divided by quotes). This approach ensures an accurate and unduplicated view of client outcomes by gender, suitable for executive insights or modeling inputs.",

This suggests that, while the number of quotes for females is higher than that for males, males tend to have slightly higher average sum insured values. In terms of the sales conversion rate, females show a higher rate at 25.21% compared to males at 20.09%. This indicates that females have a higher percentage of successful sales relative to the total number of quotes. The null gender category has the lowest conversion rate at 12.68%, which could be due to the absence of specific gender information leading to incomplete or invalid data.

    "interpretation": "The data shows that the highest average annual revenue per application (ARRA) is generated by the \"Life\" product type across several brands, with Kogan and Guardian leading the list. This suggests that \"Life\" insurance products are the most lucrative in terms of revenue per application, especially for these brands. Term Life and Funeral products also perform well for certain brands, but with lower ARRA compared to Life products. Brands with missing or null values for ARRA may indicate either insufficient data or product lines that are not significant revenue contributors. These insights can help prioritize marketing and product development efforts towards the most profitable brand-product combinations."

Land Rover, although having the lowest UW completion rate of the group (41.52%), has the highest conversion rate (51.74%), indicating high efficiency once an application gets through UW.

    "reasoning": "To determine which sections of the underwriting form contribute most to application declines, particularly for Term Life products under the 'Real' brand in 2024, we analyze the `Section` field linked to each declined case. By filtering for `ProductType = 'Term Life'`, `Brand = 'Real'`, `IsDecline = 1`, and ensuring `Section IS NOT NULL`, we isolate relevant declined applications for that year. We then group by `Section` to count how many declines are attributed to each one and calculate each section's relative contribution using a window function (`COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER()`). Sorting the results by this share highlights the most impactful sections, revealing where underwriting decisions are most commonly blocked. This structured approach helps pinpoint systemic issues—whether medical, financial, or lifestyle-related—and provides underwriters and product teams with clear insights into bottlenecks in the application process, enabling more informed decisions on form redesign, risk modeling, or agent pre-screening strategies.",

Height and weight factors (section C) are responsible for 14% of declines, underscoring the impact of BMI thresholds in the underwriting process. Other sections such as AIDS declaration, pre-qualifying medical history, and occupation are infrequent but notable triggers for application declines. The minimal representation of declines from lifestyle or residency-based sections indicates that medical risk factors are the predominant barrier to successful applications in this segment."

By filtering the data to include only current records (IsCurrent = 1), the correct product (ProductType = 'Funeral'), and non-null sum insured values (SumInsured IS NOT NULL), we ensure data relevance and integrity. Grouping by Occupation and applying AVG(SumInsured) enables us to calculate the average insured amount per occupation.

This may reflect standard policy tiers offered to lower-risk or default-rated roles. IT Managers and residential carers follow with slightly lower averages, suggesting variability in sum insured based on job type or applicant preferences. These trends can inform marketing segmentation, underwriting limits, and future product tier design, particularly for fixed-benefit insurance like Funeral products where occupation-based risk is often less nuanced but still relevant for premium structuring."
